rating,review
bad,Developed ptsd from working here this job was one of my life’s BIGGEST regrets. very abusive negative culture hours were insane managers were uneducated and coworkers did unethical things to get ahead
bad,"I worked in the Danville,VA location, and it sucked. Store manager hid in the back most of the time, ASM was clueless and most of the staff would rip customers off. I was there for a short period of time and knew that wasn’t the company for me. I was bullied while I was there and did not like going into work very negative."
bad,Have nothing to sat that word be good. Comcast is just a company that pays the CEO and not the people that work for them. I can not say the were kind or help me when I really needed then.
bad,"The Goals they want to achieve there are tangible by the majority of the sales team, the supervisors spit nonsense about its you holding yourself back but not the phone calls themselves. They expect you to take a disgruntled phone call and turn it into a triple play with home security and mobile. People steal actual sales from other people."
bad,"It’s true what everyone says, you are just a number to them. Your 10 hour shift turns to a 12 hour with out a warning and you are expected to just deal with it. Supervisors don’t answer your phone calls. Pay raises are determined by metrics you can’t  control."
bad,"It really depends on who your supervisor is, they put people in positions just b/c they have a degree but have no clue what they are doing. There was a lot of favoritism in the company."
bad,"Poorly Ran, supervisors are the worst very unprofessional, they work to pull you down instead of help you succeed. Very  into clicks. Managers are no better. On site HR very helpful and will address your issues immed."
bad,I worked here for way too long and would not and I men not recommend Comcast. Only thing they care about is butts in seats to take calls. This is not a recommendation by any means
bad,"Management and leadership sucks. Worse company I have ever worked for in my life. They don’t care about you as an employee."
bad,"Comcast will hype up their benefits and salary range, but what they hide is management will never have your back even if you get verbally abused on the phone. I heard gay and racial slurs daily from their rich white customers and I told my direct manager and he did nothing. I also got a call pulled in which I was getting verbally abused and they sided with the Rich White Customer because if they lose him then they lose money. mind you I had 12 sales for them that month."
bad,"discriminated , denied reasonable accommodations due to disability, paid less than poorly performing male coworkers, Retaliated by managers and HR for voicing grievances.  An overall horrible company"
bad,"Comcast over works you, treats you like children and often times, management will talk down to you.  I do not recommend Comcast to anyone who has a family."
bad,"Comcast is interested in one thing and one thing only... Separate as much cash from customers as possible without delivering anything"
bad,"The systems and products changed nearly monthly,  and not given the time to learn -- but company did charge points against your record if you did not process as expected or get the sales .   "
bad,Horrible company to work for! You will most likely regret working here. Low pay. Horrible hours. Micromanaging. Benefits are okay. One of the worst jobs I’ve ever had.
bad,"I am one of those people who find the positive in everything. I am constantly telling people to look on the bright side. This company literally put me into a deep depression. Our house flooded during a hurricane and they wanted me to find a way to make it work, to put my desk and computer up high so I could continue to work. We ended up in a hotel because it was to our knees and covering electric outlets. Mind you, this was AFTER I sent my supervisor a video of us walking through my house in ankle deep water."
bad,They put you on nights and you never get off them stuck there with no way of getting days They lie to you. They promise you the world and when it time to change your shift the make excuses
bad,"Company is poorly run at all levels of management from the top down. This is clearly reflected in the poor quality of service delivered from all departments within Comcast. "
bad,"Poor management, minimal advancement, poor salary, lacking coordination with dispatch, basic necessities, ie, equipments, tools, not proper time allotted to perform tasks."
bad,Typical big business. Couldn’t care less about you as a person. Not worth the hassle anymore for the pay.No chance for advancement.Life balance is horrible.
bad,The worst decision I ever made was deciding to go to work for Comcast. It’s a very cut throat environment and they are more interested in making those sales than they are about customer service. There’s nothing but a bunch of backstabbers and liars that works there. The only good employees have left Comcast. Just like I did.
bad,"The supervisor I had doesn't know how to support us. She didn't even know how to speak to the customers like a Supervisor. Ans the worst thing is, she doesn't know about product knowledge."
bad,"worst job ever. they have absolutely no empathy for their customers, and completely lack respect for them. We were expected to persistently nag each and every customer to spend more money, the billing system was never right, 80% of the callers were already irate when you answered because of the hoops they had to jump through with the automated system just to speak to someone who speaks the same language."
bad,"Company will fire you for anything.  Even if you have a medical emergency such as low blood sugar issues. Managers are lazy, hr is no help.  Always on time, kept up good numbers just have a medical issue with blood sugar and was termed because my bloog sugar dropped low on the floor to the point i passed out.  Instead of asking are you ok, they just let you go.  Do not care about their customers or employees, its all about the bottom dollar"
bad,Manager will throw in your face about the benefits they give you and discounts they give you for being employed; and used that to against you to wash their hands against your wages. I rather not get discount and get a better wage. Their health and disability insurance is a scam. Don’t trust them and keep all paper work to protect yourself. it’s all business to them.
bad,"Work for yourself out of a company-provided van. That was the hook that got me. I could go out on the road and pick up work and if I wanted more hours I could always ask for more jobs and stay late. The problem is the management and the toxic attitude involved in the cable industry. The customers already hate you before you get there, and your supervisors are so busy with reacting to performance metrics that you become nothing but a number to them. If your score drops, prepare for daily harassment."
bad,"Pay does not match what they require of you. Many unfair practices. As long as your making the company money. You can violate the rules and othersno seniority .new hires make more than people that has been there for years,and havetrain the new fires. Almost feels like slavery"
bad,"The company has a terrible work culture. As an installation technician you have no value to them. You dan be discarded and replaced at any time. Thou they want the max out of you. If you want to leave they will not hesitate to let you leave without a blink of an eye. To get a pay raise you have to meet certain metrics, but those metrics are hard to attain. So bottom line you are being setup for failure. The numbers are rigged so that you do not meet them. They rig it by giving you damaged equipments which will fail on you, and by giving you too many jobs so that you won't make it to your next one. The managers will keep on saying that the company has great benefits, which they do, but you can't pay your bills of live life with benefits. I did learn a lot with the company, you have the freedom but the pay is terrible. Working for a fast food place would be equivalent to working at Comcast, pay wise. The jobs is dangerous, even though they provide all the PPE. I can go for days but at the end of the day if you are trying to squeeze something out of them, they will tell you; this is a business, and if you don't like it here go somewhere else. With that said the Company is terrible to work for."
bad,"Expected to solve all problems a customer has in 6 minutes includig upselling. "
bad,"Nothing much  learned. Systems were not working as planned. We had to find a way to keep busy all day, I must have read the same manuals over and over again!"
bad,They have no regard for their employees going through domestic violence situations. They made no effort to accommodate disabilities they didn’t understand .
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked. At the end of the contract, I did not accept a full time position. This is a great place to work if you have no people skills or conscience."
bad,comcast is an working environment. it is very competitive and always changing so brace yourself. It is not very friendly on the pay side so if you are looking for only a challenge and opportunity this is it.
bad,"Management out of touch, no room for grow professionally. They promote only one type of employees, cannot say here because is not allowed. Management is micromanaging all the time. Nothing good about this company. Never recommend to anybody. "
bad,This company does not do a good job for its employees and its customers. This was the worse company I have ever worked for. I would not recommend anyone to work here. Diversity in upper mgmt is not encouraged.
bad,Worked for comcast for over 4 years and became ill and unable to work in the call center and they refused to accommodate me to work from home. there were several other employees that where in my same department and position that worked from home. I became so ill from the call center that I left by ambulance and never returned. My doctor and I continued to request accommodation and they still refused.
bad,"Only work here if you need to. Management is constantly rotating, and work will be dumped on you until you are drowning with no end in site. They consistently lay off and fire, and it's all swept under the rug. Check layoffs . com if you don't believe me."
bad,"Please, please for the love of god pay attention to what I am about to expose here. I wouldn't wish the lifestyle of being an employee for this disgusting shady company on my worst enemy. "
bad,"Get rid of all mid-level performers and below."
bad,"This was by far the worst company I've ever worked for. In the beginning it was alright. Tech's would call in for simple billing code changes or ask to send a signal. As the time went on- we were basically asked to do the advanced support's(tier 2 & 3) job as well, but  still getting paid the same. They hire inexperienced supervisors whom don't even understand the role. All the ""supervisors"" do is walking around, gossip, and talk bad about the hardworking agents. There is very little support from them as well as the managers. When they ""support"" you, its just micro managing your aux usage. The stats are pathetic and setting you up for failure anyways. You'll be expected to be on the phone all 8-10 hrs of the day. hardly any breaks. From the moment you log into your phone until its time to go its typically back to back calls. You'll be dealing with stupid techs that can't manage to do their job and customers yelling at you because the dumb techs don't know how to handle the issue. It's a very disorganized department. Honestly, don't see it lasting too long. I was so stressed out that my doctor told me to please find another job."
bad,"Comcast is the kind of company that watches its employees and exploits its contractors.  Everyone puts tape on cameras in conference rooms and their computers.  They promise ""long-term"" contracts, then suddenly end it with zero notice citing ""budget"" issues.  When one reaches out for a reference, they don't even return messages."
bad,This company promotes reps for adding services to customer accounts that they nevet asked for. They give these reps mac books and superbowl tickets to encourage them. I considered this fraud.
bad,The employees experience is ultimately  based on the stores management. Horrible manager horrible experience. No support from management. The commission structure isn’t fair. You don’t get credit for all sales. Favoritisms within the working place and overall company. Horrible communication. Part time employees are made to work full time hours but don’t qualify for affordable benefits.
bad,"My first two years were busy but extremely rewarding. Shortly after the constant change of management and the rapid decline of moral and lack of support caused a downward spiral of let downs and disappointment. No upward movement opportunities, unjust grading system, and terrible office politics created a volatile work environment."
bad,The pay is not good. The hours are long and inconsistent. You will learn skills that are only useful while working there. Learning Comcast cable and Internet is not going to help you with any other job or career. There are hundreds of people trying to get the same job promotions. It’s gonna be about who you know in he company more than what you know.
bad,And they expect you to continue the thievery. It’s very nerve wrecking to be scripted to lie to everyone you meet and to lie to their face pretending you are doing them a service while they charge their customers exorbitant prices for shoddy products. All b.c they monopolized a neighborhood and can do just that.
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees, if you're lucky enough to make it past 8 years of work you're in the clear, any amount of time before that. You're expendable"
bad,"Comcast promises high pay to new hires - this is what it would be if you met your sales goals which are NOT ATTAINABLE unless YOU ARE FAVORITED. "
bad,"I was part of the 8,000 they released in December 2017 and they made us sign a non disclosure before we were paid a severance pay. Company  cut out paying commission every two weeks to once a month, the pay was also reduced ,"
bad,"Most people are afraid they are going to lose their job on a daily basis. Almost everyone believes they deserve to be paid more but Comcast never agreed. Every time pay came up (which is quite often) especially in their monthly surveys, they would say we were paid more than fairly for our position when other similar positions at other companies pay MUCH more than they were offering. They would frequently bring up the fact they give you courtesy services(which you still have to pay for it's just discounted) They treat you like just another body and would have you replaced in a week if you dropped dead.  It was a weekly occurrence that people would leave the building in ambulances after having panic attacks on the job.  They would constantly ask for your opinion besides the monthly surveys and if you gave them a negative opinion they would say you're just complaining and you would be a marked target after that. (They would try to find things to get you in trouble for I've seen it happen first hand to many people.) I absolutely DO NOT recommend Comcast as a place to work whatsoever. You can find another job with similar pay/benefits no problem and will most certainly be treated better than Comcast will treat you."
bad,"Poor Management. Crummy hours. They change constantly. Management does not help advance employees unless you are one of their pets, and incomplete week pay."
bad,It was not the environment I expected and is not a place where promotion happens from within. Changes happen so fast that the agents are leaving at an alarming rate
bad,"Management sucks, they hound you to get off the phone quickly instead of actually trying to help customers. They are more concerned about the time you take on the call."
bad,"Awful company, they lie to employees, and rip off customers. There’s a reason why companies like this will be extinct in 20 years , the decline in work already started. Bias, racism."
bad,"Must be willing to lie to customers,  get them locked into contract or term agreements or pay an astronomical amount for a sub-pare service, also must be willing to totally disregard customer's needs and sell according to department goals. In sales you are only recognized or commended when you have pushed some over inflate package that won't be economical for the customer in the long run. Services aren't typically what they advertise them to be and Comcast looks  for any way not to take responsibility for any system failures or short comings."
bad,This company is like a cult with there cult like culture of staying positive.  If the building was on fire and you scream the building is on fire they would say stay positive.  The company screws the customer everyday.  Along with they screw there employees everyday.  If you liked getting screwed go work at Comcast
bad,Stay far away.  Bad Management.  Pay is good.  People are nice.  Bad leaders are rewarded for their ruthless tactics.  Turnover is common and encouraged.  Stay far away.
bad,"Typical day- stress, high demand, general discomfort. "
bad,"As an IT person brought in to solve internet issues, I found it highly disturbing that Comcast forced their employees to try to sell their services even when a current service issue was unresolved. This is very poor practice and shows that the company is interested in immediate sales, not quality support and long-term customer satisfaction."
bad,Besides learning about the different packages and how they are billed there is nothing good that I can say about this company. I don't know if it was because I worked through a staffing agency but they kept cutting our hours and did not need any people. I live in Florida and we have hurricanes but they still wanted us to come in (even though we were under a state of emergency)
bad,"No security, always making less and doing more after almost a decade. Started as an employee and have been a contractor on and off for the last few years doing more while earning less with no benefits. They force you to those positions that used to be employee based with benefits and pay into something with no pay or benefits."
bad,good job stressful environment in the call center probably wouldn't return but they have multiple [perks and great health insurance if you can handle call center this is for you
bad,Not worth applying youre very expendable and they will not conpensate you fairly. Youre just a pawn to them and they will treat you as such. Benefits are ok but cost of living is horrible
bad,"A typical work day consists of sitting up new cable, internet or phone accounts. Processing bill issues and payments. The hardest part of the job was went the main service would go out cause several customers to overload the service center."
bad,"My previous employer, Down Under Construction, is subcontracted by Comcast. They dug  holes  and trenches to lay cable lines for customers of Comcast."
bad,"Very corporate, use to be a good place to work at but the pay is not fair for the amount of work you’re given. Management never informs you as to when things will change and be going into effect"
bad,They will not support you for advancement they will fire you for anything. If you dispute a corrective action you will be fired they wont give you a raise if you have any corrective action
bad,"You get paid hourly plus commission but I wouldn’t even calculate or count on that being applied to your pay because there’s way too many hoops and balls you have to juggle simultaneously with a knife to your back forcing you to push more on the customers than they initially called in for because if you just give them exactly what they called in for even if they’ve stated they don’t want any of your companies other lines of business so you don’t inquire, the higher ups don’t like that and albeit you’ve made the company well over the amount of revenue they request you make them for the quarter since you’re not loading customers up with more than they asked for you’re not going to ever achieve your close rate or see the bonus that comes along with it. This is the shadiest company and position I’ve ever played a role for. If you’re okay with messing over and lying to people just to make a few extra cents sometimes a dollar or two your every keystroke on the computer being watched and tracked, bullied as well as micromanaged and chained to your desk/phone anxious and uncomfortable while engaging with the customers afraid to say the wrong thing because every last one of the calls you take are being (very obviously and annoyingly)listened to this is the place for you."
bad,Never work a this vampire culture!!! They suck you dry and then throw you away when they have no more use for you. There is no effort to cultivate employees other  skills.
bad,"Inbound sales is a horrible job and Comcast a horrible company. In this position you answer a few dozen calls per day and sell to the people who are calling one to five products- usually four of which they don’t want. "
bad,I will not go into detail but they do not listen to the employees at all and think they know better for their employees then they do. They have had several lawsuits for the way they treat their employees so that shows they do not care about you.
bad,They expect to much out of you and make getting raises and promotion to hard  when you come to them with genuine concerns about the job they tell you that they will look into it but it never gets anywhere
bad,"Comcast really doesn’t care about, not only their customers but, Comcast doesn’t care about their employees either. We were to not let customers disconnect, we were to insist upgrading. As for Comcast caring about their employees, they knew That they did not have to comply with doctors recommendations. They knew that they could replace the employee , if the employee would quit."
bad,"It's understandable that the company is sales driven. What's not understandable is the way management drives out the people that aren't their favorites.  They have mandatory overtime--so if you have kids, you better have a good support system at home. Scheduling is horrid unless you've worked there over ten years."
bad,"A full load of bureaucracy, poor product deployment, unreliable service. Replaced with contracting Indians for peanut lesser pay. "
bad,I would never recommend this company to anybody seeking employment. The pay is pathetic considering how much you have to know and do for the low pay.. It's a very stressful and hostile work environment because of the poor management.A lot of favoritism goes on there so if the boss doesn't like you they will find a way to fire you. No job security whatsoever; you will be micromanagea to death unless of course you're one of the favorites. when you enter your time if you're off by 2 seconds they will kick it back and refuse your payment for that week until you correct the two seconds. One lady work there for 15 years and because she didn't want to move into a management position they found a way to fire her. She was making good money at the time and they didn't want to continue to pay her that high rate unless she moved into management which she did not want to do. Run the other way if you're smart!! Comcast was by far the worst company I ever worked for.
bad,"a typical day at work was horrible, i learned nothing, management was horrible, workplace culture was horrible, the hardest part of the job was walking"
bad,How do you tell people to run as fast as you can from the comcast nightmare. I sat in a meeting as a contractor while the manager handed out slips with bonus amounts to the direct employees. Total lack of class.
bad,"Working as a technician for the company is one of the lowest positions one can have. With that being said, the opportunity for the company to be a great one is within reach, but the demand on techs and the lack of pay compared to others in our industry makes the work dreadful."
bad,"Not a good company to work for.  Culture is oppressive, pay is not competitive and work like balance is non-existent.  Management is not supportive.  Would not recommend working here."
bad,"working for this call center was horrible! you took multiple calls a day, routinely were cursed out by customers and management required you to attempt to up sale customers on each phone call, even if people were calling in for technical assistance."
bad,"I was a top producer at Comcast/Xfinity. I was never late, nor did I miss any days for almost 3yrs. I had an abusive supervisor who showed lots of favoritism to those he knew or wanted to score with! I was thrown under a bus by my sup and complained to deaf ears. In our call center Hip Hop music is blasted, ping pong tournaments which definitely interfered with you attempting to focus on the clients. They don’t care.. The supps push agents to sell mobile phones, one problem!? They are never in stock. However, you’re to blame as they constantly tell you to “own up” to everything! If you like abuse, this job is for you! I too saw ppl  passing out and having stress issues. It’s ridiculous how horrible you’re  treated! Their motto “ it’s not what you know, it’s who you know” and believe me, it’s very factual."
bad,"Comcast discriminates against its employees, seeking reason to fire them if they obtain FMLA. They are extremely corrupt and dont care because they dont have to, being as large as they are"
bad,"That title is no joke.  People literally died from the stress during my employment there.  Heart attacks, strokes, one suicide.   In a meeting a manger said, ""You will get abused in this role, TAKE the abuse.""  In my case, the manager was verbally abusive.  One example was ""For the food spread, make sure to sanitize your hands...and only take your share.""  He whispered that in my ear.  There were other instances too, and I went to HR, who did nothing.  Aside from that, I managed to be a top earner on the team.  I finally left after five trips to the ER for life threatening high blood pressure.  I did try to apply, in another state I am interested in moving to, and after a flurry of emails and phone calls, due to the unwillingness of the former director and HR, I learned that NO record of my top earner status, and subsequent award for being one of the top performers was in my records."
bad,Comcast only cares about bottom line. Will throw techs under the bus. Stressful with no structure or care to time. Management makes up their own rules
bad,"Expect to work over time basically every day, have unreasonable metrics to meet, get the short end of the stick from every other department in the company, feedback goes entirely disregarded AT BEST or leads to ""not retribution but definitely retribution"" and no matter what happens it's your fault."
bad,"I have been working for Comcast since 2012, when I started our center only received calls from Florida then the company decided to make our center National so we received calls from all over the United States. The department that I worked in when I started was Bilingual Retention which was tough sometimes dealing with irate customers and trying to upsell them while keeping them as customers but looking back now it was more manageable than Bilingual Inbound Sales because you were dealing with accounts that were already open and all you had to do was keep them as a customer, as soon as you get the screen popup for the account you already made money on that account and the sales goals were manageable."
bad,Terrible experience. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not a good company. Don't expect advancement or a career. Company only cares about profit not employees
bad,When I was hired on with this company I was happy. As i worked in the company more I started to see a pattern in how the other Agents and I where being treated. Working for Comcast is a big joke the way they treat you in training and work is bad. In training if you missed two days for any reason you where out and fired. Then in working on the what they call the floor. They would make you sit there and wait to hear that beep and then after the call you only had 30 seconds to get you breath and the you had to go back in and take more calls. I don't think the hole company knows what they are doing and I think they need to be trained in how to treat the employee's better.
bad,"They drive you like a horse and don’t compensate worth the work, lots of hazardous work, they tell us because we get free cable we aren’t compensated what we should get payed. I would rather take the compensation and figure what I want for my services"
bad,"Where to begin... this company was terrible in every way possible. Management has no idea how a call center operates, favoritism like you would not believe, an HR department that is buddy buddy with the supervisors that show favoritism which results in you being able to report it but then ultimately being the one who gets in trouble. A further escalation path known as Comcast Listens that cares even less and does nothing to rework a toxic site crumbling to the ground. Made promises upon hire that they could not uphold. Absolutely no chance of advancement regardless of the skills and knowledge you bring. A scheduling and time off system that gives no (expletive) about you or your family, emergencies included. Released a new billing system even though they were warned by testers was not ready and broken. A system so bad that left customers without service even though they paid the bill, some even more than a month without service. Ticket creation system and lazy escalation teams that leaves tickets untouched for months on end. Company is in full support of customers calling you the worst names imaginable and attacking you personally but then punishing you when you disconnect, despite several polite warnings to the customer, then they will turn around and reward that customer with credits which only effectively encourages more mistreatment to employees. Floor support and supervisor support is pretty much nonexistent. Supervisors disappear for hours on end with no consequences. Don’t bring your ideas to improve operations, they will be stolen from you and you will be targeted hard"
bad,"Very high attrition rate.  Have to be close to supervisors and don't expect them to have your back.  No help with job advancement. Cut throat,  sips getting fired all the time and agents and they won't tell you why.  Change is always happening nothing consistent."
bad,It's a good old boy club.  I don't like how they treat customer and there employee. There taking most of the work to Utah and lay off everyone they can
bad,"Most of the individuals that work at the Xfinity portion of this organization have no idea of how their products even work, and they have been working there 10, 15, some even 20 years.  I asked if they ever asked management their questions, and I was told that management told them that they didn't know either.  That is totally sad.  I came to this organization from Verizon and was treated as Public enemy number one because I did know all of the answers. Avoid this place like the Black Plaque, not unless you have no ambition, don't care about the customer base, have a lack of integrity; well you get the point. Oh yeah, also avoid, if you don't like to get paid. It's like modern-day slavery for the non-educated because you would have to be absolutely dumb or have a partial lobotomy to work for their wages. I make more as a contractor then the on staff employees. Shame on you Xfinity/Parent company, Comcast."
bad,Reps not given training for new calls they decide you now take.  Limited resources to handle new calls.  The objective is to have calls answered by any regardless of whether you know how to handle call.
bad,"You will have the job of 6-7 queues with inadequate training, poor structure, unorganized, unfit untrained leadership. There's no room for advancement. No one listens to your concerns. If you speak up, you will be targeted and then terminated. Training is a complete joke. You will develop anxiety."
bad,There were so many problems with this job and no one was ever on the same page at Comcast.  I had several problems and no one was willing to address them or resolve the problems.  Worst job Ever
bad,Large Company that doesn't really care about its employees or their time in. After joining the leadership team I found that it's a bunch of ego's that care more about making themselves look good rather than taking care of their employees.
bad,"Ask around -- -not even for a job, but ask ANYONE and you will hear that Comcast is a horrible company.  They say they are good, but I can say that too - doesn't make it true."
bad,"Horrible place to work! You are a number to management, they care about is your scorecard which is stacked against you. They culture inside is nothing but rot. You are micro managed to the point you need to ask permission to use the bathroom. This is corporate America at its worse. If you bring up an issue during the weekly meetings, you are pulled aside after the meeting and threatened to keep your mouth shut. As for advancement, if you don't kiss enough butt, you are constantly overlooked, and those that do are coddled and pushed ahead and their scorecard 'reworked' to help them. We were also told repeatedly to lie to the customer about their shotty equipment and other issues, and your 'technical support was horrible except for a few. You are always overloaded with work, and constantly have to pick up work of the deadbeat but kissers. Comcast is the place dreams and careers go to die! Good luck if you get hired here and don't say I didn't warn you."
bad,"Sales goals change like the wind every month, the company tries to figure out how they can pay less commission. Reps are pushed to over sell on every single call, everyday. It is one of the most stress filled place to ever work. Internal politics are sickening. Supervisors act like they are your friends  in reality they could care less and really are only worried about themselves with a very few exceptions. "
bad,"A place that management discriminate regular employees. Headend  Sr director with no knowledge is making money from comcast, using contractor. He is defamation former employees. Until company start respect employees and stop the abuses comcast is not going to be a good company."
bad,Goals are unrealistic and they do not provide additional training when  asked.  If you do not meet budget within 6 months of being hired then you are reprimanded
bad,This is the worst company to work for. I only stuck around for the benefits but with the way I'm being treated due to my chronic medical illness I am fed up. Not understanding of medical needs & not accommodating. Please do yourself a favor & stay away.
bad,Don't get me wrong here. I worked at two different Comcast sales call centers. Oregon as well as Washington. If I were just rating Oregon I'd definitely give all 5's. Manager was very supportive and helpful at all times. In Washington management was not supportive or positive.
bad,"allowed oyher reps to spit on my windshield daily, threw my lunch away all the time, and physically was assaulted by white girl, on camera and she still works there!"
bad,I wouldn't recommend Comcast as a place to work. Their motto is to take every penny from a customers pocket even if you have to lie to get it. they really don't care about the employees and even less about the customers
bad,"If you thought Comcast service is bad, it is because THEY TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES TO SCREW YOU. They care nothing about customer service. The company is run by bean-counters who care only for the profit line. The company and management is SO disorganized, and they don't care, as long as labor is cheap and they have enough inept minorities in supervisory positions. Screw the customer well enough, get promoted. Try to help them (or take too long to try to do so), and you get disciplined. All around one of the top 3 office jobs I can imagine."
bad,Cant move up in the company no matter how good your numbers are and how good of a technician your are if you are not liked by supervisors or manager i worked in the antelope office in California and it was all bad technician were leaving after working for 10+ years like myself.
bad,"Company tells you to lie to sell. Good sells persons leave, terrible unethical persons thrive it is a terrible cutler to be a part of. Money is great, you feel terrible."
bad,this company is not ver employee  friendly. they only care about the money. There is not much room to grow in the company either. The pay is okay if you are okay with the bare min
bad,"Very transactional versus strategic, little regard for customers or employees and it shows in turnover in both areas.  Could have been a great value oriented service provider but missed the boat and will readily be replaced by 5G"
bad,"I need to start this off with a disclaimer that I was in the collections dept, and when you are even 10 days late on your bill or had any troubles with your signal, people would call in a talk to me first. Only spoke to mad people who were already mad and got more mad when I asked them for money before I could help them. So, just the worst. Did this for only 9 months but i would never again."
bad,"Poor management that favors a few employees who lie to customers to close deals. People here will steal deals from you , with little if any punishment. Highly stressful, cut throat environment. If you have any integrity, and won't steal deals from your co-workers to meet the metrics keep looking. By far the worst mistake of my life was accepting a position here. It is soulless, profit driven company without an ounce of customer service. They promise you the world during your interview, but you quickly realize it is all smoke and mirrors."
bad,If you are a man and report any harassment. You will ne dismissed. The pay is not enough to support a family on your own. There is no chance to advance.
bad,"When management tell you that they do not like working at Comcast then you know something is up. Managers are miserable, staff was miserable and the whole working environment was totally off. As many commercials that Comcast do, they do not pay their employees anything. Comcast pays the bare minimal to their staff, and do to the fact that you have to go out in the suburbs to get to work, meaning that you have to drive to work everyday, they do not compensated you for your travel back and forth from work. Terrible company."
bad,They will take advantage of you and not support your career.  bad workplace. .................. beware of top management......................not a good culture.....................
bad,Comcast is the largest fraud in the industry. Not only do they over charge customers but they give them roach filed equipment. On top of that they have a very bad issue with the women there sexually harassing the men. Like thirsty desperate old house wives and lonely girl friends type harassment.
bad,"It is a really fast-paced environment, you have to consistently learn new things and reach new quota. They have really high turn over rate and they are hiring all the time."
bad,I would not recommend that anyone in their right mind to work for comcast. It's sad how they do things at the place of business. You have to be liked or in the in team .
bad,"The environment was very aggressive and stressful, poor management to oversee department, no room for advancement within the company not able to reach my full potential at this company."
bad,You can work with a great team of ppl. But having The most important position of the building and that is to keep it clean during and after an event we are not respected for job well done we sometimes have little time to complete a very large cleanup with not enough staff..ppl have been hired and either quit that night or no longer than a week. We have to eat in either the locker room or storage room or where we clock in at. We are not offered a bottle of water as much. Bring your own food. We Are The Only Ppl That Are Not Allowed To Eat In The Cafeteria..When they have an event n they serve food to the fans and usually there be great amounts of edible food left that we wouldn't mind eating..They Throw It Away In Our Face..I Did 2yrs 10mths working both the events n overnight i did my job very well and loved every moment. But it is a place to work till you find something better..You must work 4 hrs or more
bad,"They give new AE's a book of business with 100% churn. Beginning a career here is an uphill battle with little to no support. If you do not have your own clients to bring to Spotlight, you will be living on your base pay."
bad,"RUN - don't work here. Micro management at its finest!  Pay is terrible and they treat you like garbage.  all Comcast cares about is the almighty dollar - not You, not the customers, regardless of what they say.  "
bad,This place is horrible!! You will be hired as “ account management agent” but technically will be a sales agent and get nothing but trash calls  where you can’t sell. The company doesn’t care and gives you the excuse if you use the horrible call flow they implemented you will sale. The call flow frustrates the customer and makes the customer experience worse!. The pay is not worth the stress. It’s not good hourly pay and the commission is pathetic.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless you have no other option. I watched this company in the 6 years I was there layoff over 5,000 people and made them reapply for other positions. I stuck it out do to wanting to learn more about the telecommunication industry . I was also hoping this was a one time thing. As I continued my employment they did it again to very hard working and valuable employees. They just stated there positions titles were changing and laid off more people . Horrible company. I was not apart of the second layoff but I was apart of the first."
bad,"Handles large volume of incoming telephone calls, covering full range of customer services in a prompt and professional manner, obtaining all information for resolution of transaction. Answer customer questions regarding equipment and troubleshoot calls."
bad,The Comcast collections department is horrible and the management and pay was even worse. Its stressful and you are just a number and nothing more to these people.
bad,The company I worked for no longer exists.  AT&T Broadband was spun off and merged with Comcast.  Neither the management nor any employees that I knew work there now.
bad,The worse you are in terms of dictatorial behavior and hating the customer the more likely you'll be promoted to team lead or even management. Absolutely awful people.
bad,This job is very inconsistent. They don't care about the employees only making money for the company.I worked there for 3 yrs with the issue I had they didn't even take that into consideration
bad,I loved the job but the what they had us doing and what they were paying us was ridiculous. The longer you work there the more responsibilities you will get with no extra pay.
bad,Comcast was a great opportunity I learned a lot working for Comcast. Hired and promoted to a new job through Comcast management really not engaging and unapproachable
bad,"They will lie to you about pto, metrics, raises, benefits and actual job. "
bad,If you have every worked at Comcast you know exactly how it is. Tough on you to meet stats. No way on moving up in the company. Say they promote from within but they always hire Supervisors from outside the company. No sense of security.
bad,"Just as miserable to work for as it is to be a customer of. The benefits are minimum, and they are continually doing layoffs to try and compensate for a poorly run and managed organization."
bad,"Extremely stressful,not customer centered the customer does not matter and most employees feel like they are being paid to lie to people.  I would not recommend anyone work there."
bad,"The training was not sufficient to handle the calls given. When hired was told it would be 6weeks of training it turned out to only be 4and my trainer was lost most of the time, a lot of things I learned I got from my peers."
bad,fast paced work environment. micro-management at all levels of supervision. out in the field beyond required work hours. pay raises based on management liking of you vs productivity.
bad,You will constantly be dealing with angry and frustrated customers and will be verbally abused throughout the day. Call volume is back to back calls with no rest in between calls. Constant computer problems will mean your job will be harder because the programs you need have crashed. People carried out on stretchers routinely. Supervisor will be indifferent to your request for assistance on difficult calls.
bad,This company was a MLM  and a giant pyramid scheme that was built by defrauding customers and Xfinity.   NuImage should be investigated for their fraud
bad,This company wants you to make them top priority in your life they have no consideration if you have an emergency with family and if you end up having to go into the hospital they will hold that against you even if you bring them verified documentation.
bad,"There is no benefits, your making comishion not an hourly wage. You have to sell at lest 10 packages a day to even get a half way decent pay check and the area they send out good luck even getting one sale. The management is terrible and won’t help. If you ask for help it is the end of the world to them. The expectations are ridiculously high and absurd. I wouldn’t recommend this job to my dog."
bad,"horrible, its the worst place i ever work. the supervisors were incompetent. they didnt notice hard work they only responded to brown nosers. bad management"
bad,I do not want to do any review for them  I worked there five years and was treated disrespectfully by management I only received good sales training experience
bad,"You have to lie to customers to get things going,, customers getting over charged. You get zero support from your supervisor. favoritism is a big issue"
bad,"Everyone from the employees to the customers are nothing but a number and a way to make the company money. High turn over, managers are not really present to help in any capacity."
bad,"The Comcast/Xfinity company is nothing less than a manipulating, and emotional soul crushing entity. "
bad,"Awful management, very bad training, micromanaged, favoritism, sexism, racism, unrealistic expectations. Not a friendly environment, workplace relationships leading to favoritism."
bad,very stressful job sales are mandatory and pay is no good and there is no room for real advancement in company and no real paid time off or holidays off
bad,politically fired no advancement unless you are connected avoid no opportunity florida is terrible never work in florida no advancement low pay long hours
bad,A typical day is cold calling businesses to try and sell Comcast Business Services. Management was OK. The workplace culture was horrible. Not recommended.
bad,Great place to work. face paced Call center environment. Everybody is very friendly. Career advancement and everything with that company. I would recommend it to anyone.
bad,none nothing to say but management wasn't good team support was very low poor management was a bad location not good working place working with supervisors and team members
bad,I haven't worked at Comcast for 13 years.  They have grown and changed significantly in that time.  I doubt any of the people that I knew are still there.
bad,horrible culture over worked under paid. Management does not value loyal hard working employees. Company is looking to move all jobs from California to other states to pay less
bad,"I only worked here for the benefits, micromanagement, bad leadership, they are more concerned with internal tracking than with the customer experience."
bad,I was a door to door sales person. Toughest job that I ever had. Getting yelled at on a daily basis all in the effort of trying to make a living.  HORRIBLE
bad,I had worked for Comcast for almost 13 years when I was let go. I relocated to Chattanooga from west palm beach and when I relocated I was told we had to gaff a pole. I had never had to gaff before and while I was in training to do so I fell and injured my shoulder and elbow to the point there was talk of surgery. When I returned from medical leave I was forced right away to gaff again with no training or help. Because I could not do it I lost my job of 13 years with the company.
bad,I left this company completely as of December 2016. My whole career was dedicated to this company and it’s success. I speak from a regional level in management and I worked all the time and the work/life balance was horrendous. I would caution and ask a lot of questions before accepting a position with this organization.
bad,"no i did not like working for Comcast, Comcast had a bad staff. i did not get enough sleep because i had to work over time everyday anxd most of the time i didn't get payed for it"
bad,"When you have bosses who cannot figure out the systems it is a problem. The problems were never addressed, the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing."
bad,not a good place t work. Supply chain was always slow getting required equipment on a day to day basis.  Always stressing on what was coming or if what you ordered was filled.
bad,I hated working there and I hope I never have to work in a place like it again. The management couldn't teach and the staff didn't know how to train. They throw you on the floor expecting to know what to do.
bad,Everyday was stressful and aggravating. Management was only worried about numbers and discouraged spending too much time with any customer. They don't explain things properly. They constantly make changes and always fail to inform the technicians that actually are out in the field doing the work. Which in turn makes the job itself harder to do.
bad,Accounts are switched and passed to favorites rather than fairly or the highest performers.  New Management seems very confused on the direction of the company and how to postion the products in the market.  Television and internet products are not effective and management seems to be protecting their jobs in the CT market
bad,This was a really bad place to work the manament was really bad and had not training on how to support there team . And a very unfair placed to work was a very hostel place to work
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone.  They may be a corporation but they have no structure and you can't trust them. There only concern is the bottom line.  The turnover rate is extremely high.  Because they don't care about customers, you talk to many irate customers daily and they takes a toll on the overall morale."
bad,They say a low paying job with great leadership is better than a high paying job with bad management. ..... Its a hard company to work for if your not a crowd pleaser or a yes person. Do not try to stand out or make waves as you will be humidified for doing so.
bad,"You aren't given a second to breathe. Nothing else to say except, they can be more lenient with availability......................................................."
bad,Terrible company to work for. By far the worst I've worked for and I worked for Walmart. Unprofessional behavior while showing no respect for their employees.
bad,"back to back phone calls, pretty helpless on the phone with customer. cant really interact with coworkers because everyone is on the phone. A lot of stress from hundreds of calls a day"
bad,"If you like to be vastly underpaid and people spitting in your face daily, then this is the job for you. For the amount of work and changes this company puts on its employees, its a complete slap in the face what they offer as pay. I wouldnt recommend even a homeless person to apply for a job with this company"
bad,The testing doing training is not fair at all. They expect you to know everything before you even start working on the floor. If you don't pass your last test then you can't get in. Theres no hands on training for the phone calls.
bad,Managers were not capable and asked questions that they should have known. seems like they hired friends and relatives and were not subjective. High stressed working environment
bad,"Get ready to be miserable. Its all about productivity. Get it done! The amount of time to complete all tasks at the customers premise hasnt changed in 10 years. They expect miracles in a 2 hour time frame with 2 jobs in that frame. Horrible communication. Revolving door of managers,supervisors and directors that all are from the same school of dysfunction.  Many powerbar lunches will be had. Wear diapers cause you wont have time to use the bathroom.  You wont advance without getting in bed with all of management.  Even then you may get used and thrown away. Don't get stuck in the Matrix, run!!"
bad,Management knows nothing and is little help at Asheville highway Comcast call center in Knoxville Tn! Can’t help employees and ignore questions of employees. Do not work there! Awful
bad,It will work out well for anyone who will lie to get a sale. Customers are treated like rubbish and the company only cares if you upsell not fix their bills.
bad,Comcast is a zoo looking for people to make more money for share holders. Cable discount is good but your very replaceable or will never advance in the company.
bad,Comcast was and will most likely be the worst place I have ever worked.  They treat their employees just as bad as their customers.  When trying to advance in the company I was told by numerous members of management that my previous work experience and education was worthless.  Do yourself a favor a do not work there.
bad,no advancement low wages no benefotd for me refused to give me full time work never again working here better palce to be working at anywhere else glad im gone
bad,never liked anything about the company and the constant changes. I am gonna keep writing the same thing until you guys leave me alone about this company
bad,"This place allows the customers to abuse you while managers sit back and allow other reps to take the calls. They show favoritism and it's just an awful place to work. They put out products too fast. And when they fail, they want their employees to lie."
bad,Very stressful workplace management shows favoritism no time off lazy coworkers not to mention the bugs in the equipment returned sometimes and  dont start me on the warehouse staff
bad,"I did not like working for Comcast because, there was no balance between work and life outside of work.  You were expected to work what ever time you were schedule regardless of life circumstances."
bad,"worked as a field service technician, terrible and poor management, worked for porter installations, supervisor would be stealing money from employees, very stress full, not enough pay. would not recommend anyone to work for that company. especially for the supervisor, called tyrone at porter installations in lombard."
bad,all about the numbers so I would'nt recommend this company to anyone who cares about the customers.  This company is not sold on great ideas from people that are actually concerned with the well being of the subscriber itself.
bad,worked crazy hours for low wages. the staff was great and I met a lot of good people. but the work hours were terrible. its not the worst place I've ever worked though.
bad,I worked with good people and supported good people. The company as a whole was a great learning experience. There is very little room for advancement.
bad,"Managers will say what they need to make you think you are actually doing something right, when they subcontract overseas which only creates more of a mess for you to clean up."
bad,Literally anyone that leaves here is always better off and stress free there is to many bad things for me to list Its a good starter job but not a career
bad,"Not a very good place to visit, let alone work. Customers are not the friendliest and management lacks the managerial experience to make sound decisions."
bad,"the pay sucks, the management is a joke. too many turn overs "
bad,There was no chance of advancement with this employer.  The training class was not sufficient to place people on the phones.  The hours are horrible and the management team does not care about their employees.
bad,This place drained 10 years of my life and is a horrible place to work. I was made to work horrible hours that did not give me the proper work and life balance. It was very racially discriminating against a white males and I'm glad I'm gone
bad,"Had zero training! Didn't even get a single handout telling me how to perform my job. Supervisors/HR are incompetent and did not even know what the EEOC was! The pay and benefits are a joke and supervisors allow discrimination and employees to cuss each other out without any ramifications for their behavior. The workplace culture is depressing. Usually one person ends up working for the entire team. There is no accountability from supervisors or employees and most employees have an ""I don't care"" attitude."
bad,"Only the building is nice. Watch your back, everyone at every angle will stab you. Trust no one. HR has no ethics. Working here is like working for the devil himself."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. They cheat their customers as well as their employees. They set unrealistic goals for the employees. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.
bad,When I first worked here I was in heaven the people were nice and it was a clean friendly environment. Once you start seeing people leave who had been there for years you realize something is wrong. The call center will close soon and everyone will be allowed to transfer or work from home.
bad,this is a cool company the work was chill but stay to yourself and don't socialize with coworkers because people will try and get you fired. otherwise its a good job
bad,Not much to say. Was laid off after being told for over a month that there were issues with the phones. I answered phones and provided customer service to people that would call in overnight.
bad,"Comcast Cable – Houston, TX."
bad,"Pay decrease is horrible. Commission cycle has changed, causing people to have to quit after dedicating years to this company. They are currently over working their managers."
bad,Not recoomend working this job if you have a lot of customer service background and going into the sales department. Its all about driving the product before the customer service part
bad,"A typical day is extremely stressful. The company doesn't care about their employees, they only care about the bottom-line. Most people in management requires managing themselves, being they can only answer a question with a question. It's not about what you know at Comcast, but who you know."
bad,my personal opinion is that they only care about the numbers not the person. They can have a little more understanding when life happens and that would make a good company to work for
bad,only work here if you like unending repetitive questions from customers that already hate you because you are associated with one of the worst companies on the planet
bad,I always start my day pretty well sometime days go longer than others. Of course some days are horrible but got to deal with it part of the jobs. I am always happy to be a technician as job that makes customers happy
bad,Did not enjoy working there. Supervisors got fired every other month. Was not happy with all the new management. No support from leadership. Free cable was cool but not worth it.
bad,"Not a good schedule , doesnt care about those with children. They dont except doctors notes. You give your all to this company and they treat you like another number"
bad,I worked as a contractor for Comcast 23 years ago so I'm sure a lot has changed. Althought cable installs are basically the same as it was back then but equipment is different.
bad,"awful company to work for, very stressful, poor management ......not alot of growth opportunities...not alot of leadership....very negative work environment"
bad,"Responsible for managing all phases of Sales Services provided by the Sales Specialists"
bad,"The outside sales position is thank less, they don't promote within"
bad,"Comcast was a very strict company, however the pay was really good. There were monthly bonuses and the managers were good with working with you on personal things that came up."
bad,Horrible horrible... horrible.. no structure.. unprofessional supervisors..a train wreck. Supervisors  using intimidation tactics.. Supervisor sitting outside in her car with her headlights shining on the door in the mornings to see who is late.
bad,"There are 35 Supervisors reporting to 7 managers.  My Supervisor wanted to surround himself with a team of sycophants.  His attrition rate was horrendous.  Lost 28 out of 30 people on his last two teams over a 6 month period.  Many quit because they could not take the negative coaching sessions or were fired by the Managers unreasonable expectations.  "
bad,"I worked for them now for 10 years and it is always threats of losing your job everyday .... you never do well or a good job and if you do it is only for a moment before they rip it out of you again. Also system issues are horrible constant call center phone and system problems and no results in fixing them and leadership is a joke , they know absolutely nothing about their employees or the service or the job they just take up space and management is out of touch forreal"
bad,"been through 8 managements withing 2 years. Worst treatment by management to all employees, scheduling is horrible. Strict environment, but great peers"
bad,Just a job not a career. Too many lay off with new management they don't know what they're doing. They are letting good ppl go if you know too much or getting paid to much. Location under staff worker  are over work. Then they want  to buy you an  happy meal if you work 16hr.
bad,"I would answer phone calls "
bad,"Comcast has a tendency to pay their top executive 30 million plus a year yet at the same time decreases commission compensation dramatically every six months. I earned 70000 my first years doing the same job and by the time I left three years later my earnings barely reached $39000. Management doesn't really have any concern because the company is constantly replacing employees that leave due to the commission changes. Every commission change was a detriment to the employee not the company. Comcast is cash rich but it has little concern for the lower ranks. Most top paid commission employees lie to customers about phone service and home security. They tend to package these products so that it is ""cheaper"" in the short term but prices shoot up after a year. They are by far cheaper packages that include Internet only which most customers want these days. These packages are never discussed with customers. Management is about squeezing every nickels out of customers who don't want or need TV, phone service, or home security. The company does not offer any senior discount packages at all.  The reps don't sell on value because the company stresses only daily and montly matirxes that must be met. I can understand that but the comany crushes the salespersons spirit with constant changes to commision and policy. The home security system ranks very low in security system national rankings: 112 out of 130. Yes, this product is their number one concern as management will admit Comcast is no longer a cable company but a home security company. It's laughable. Nevertheless,  If you enjoy selling"
bad,"The company is now like any other call center there nothing that stand out from this company. They lie to get you in and then everything change. Lie, lie, lie is really all I can say about the company. The company suck but the people I worked with are great."
bad,"Just a very bad company to work for, beware. Also dont expect to be a contractor for ever, sometime even 5 years or more. Management is alright depending on team, but can change for the worst"
bad,"Very high stress job, very strict attendance policy and no room for flexibility if needed.  Mundane, and repetitious.  No change in the daily process."
bad,"I don't have anything to say good about working for this company "
bad,"I have never imagined a company so brutal on their employees."
bad,"Over the last 2 years this job has gotten progressively worse. The benefits are OK, but everything else is just not worth it. Everyday its some new bs literally. Commission has been going down since my start date because even though the traffic is staying consistent, they continuosly raise our goals."
bad,Never work at Comcast. The entire company is a giant cult of personality from management that employees burn out on after 6-12 months usually. The pay is absolutely terrible and the stress is unimaginable
bad,it was valued more of a honor to work there. you can not think for yourself and do the right thing. speak up and say it was wrong you were gone.  if you have your own mind it doesn't pay to work there.
bad,"Recorded customer information and inquiries using a computerized system. • Implemented advanced strategies/techniques to effectively counter competitive offers and educated customers on product comparisons.   • Remained up-to-date on products and services to ensure customer satisfaction and in order to maximize sales opportunities.  • Acted as an Ambassador for Comcast by building rapport with the customer, supporting, reassuring, and educating the customer throughout the call.  • Promoted and recommended Comcast products and services based on a logical relationship."
bad,"Terrible work environment, I didn't like there manager there. Very unprofessional people working there. Need new management. Wouldn't advise anyone to work at TLK"
bad,Most people do not last in this position 6 months! High Turnover! stay away!!!! Duryea is saturated and they hire you and waste your time! STAY AWARE or BEWARE!
bad,"Comcast Outsources jobs and the jobs withing this country there is no room for improvement because of poor management and false values. "
bad,"Comcast doesn't care about it's workers or the environment, I worked for them through a third party. They would come in monthly make decisions and leave. When approached they don't have time to speak with us and keep going."
bad,"This was one of the most stressfull jobs I ever had, and I barely stuck around out of training. They have teams telling you what to say and how to corece people to stay on with a service that doesn't value them. I had to leave due to surgery and was berated daily by HR for paperwork I had submitted 2-3 times already saying the hadn't got it. I told them I would need to end my employment to recover and never looked back"
bad,Comcast has amazing products and services but they have little care for their employees and customers.  For them it is about the bottom line.
bad,This company treats its employees like numbers not people. You are made to feel like you are a number to produce a number. If you question any of the procedures you will be labeled as a trouble maker. If you don't get clicky with the supervisors you will be targeted as a non team player.
bad,The company provides good opportunities to try the products and allows the employees to use them in their home at a no cost to the employee
bad,Before it became a corporation it was a fun place and family environment place to work. It's to impersonal now and it's who you know and they lead with fear to fire you if you speak against management or meantion unions
bad,"Very stressful,  high call volume and the schedules are not good. I have small children and wasnt able to dtop or pick them up which was a total inconvenience for me."
bad,"Management stabbed me in the back upon return from medical leave and forced me out.   Horrible place to work."
bad,"Having been with the company ten years, I have watched a cultural shift from a great place to work, to being one of the worst companies to work for. Recently they've changed benefits to exclude 401 k match, lowered the employer contribution share of health care, and lowered amount of yearly raises. Veteran  employees have recently  begun leaving in droves, including management, leaving the day to day operations in disarray."
bad,"a joke at best, very disconnected as company. They are not for the employee, and leadership is not there to promote growth. Company is completely oblivious to day workforce issues."
bad,"I hate this job, the pay was ok, I couldnt get a chance to fully get a spin on the job because things kept changing all the time, and I am open to change, but we could be doing one thing MONDAY and told to not do it anymore on WEDNESDAY."
bad,Don't recommend anyone to work there . Management is terrible ! Poor communication . Hardly ever get lunches or breaks . Vans break down never have a spare or that one is broke down
bad,"Typical day at work is a bunch of lazy people who love to argue. They will hang up on the customers because they don't feel like being bothered. If you tell management, you will be told to take care of yourself, and then eventually fired. Best part of my day quitting time!"
bad,"very rude co-workers, management cares very little about employees, short breaks, people could leave whenever they wanted. no time management skills for deadlines and sales"
bad,"I was seven minutes late doing my urinalysis I run and manage a diamond store I ran into traffic I'm a single-parent and I tried to get there before 5 o'clock the people at the urgent care said don't worry about it be here by six I got there at 507pm,  Comcast Cable made me feel implorable and profiled as a degenerate.   They had me jumping through so many hoops with such little time frame and working 40+ hours at my current job raising a family and trying to do everything they needed me to do right now!!!!"
bad,I honestly have no comment on how I was treated at this job for many years. They need big upgrades on how to treat people. Many people who work here will tell you that you do not get what you are promised.
bad,agent would change peoples account information all the time so they couldn't get into them when they called. Yet they say they are committed to the customer. Agent adding and removing tp and dp to get upgrades. Just horribe
bad,Comcast was absolutely horrible I hated that place the pay was awful the benefits were awful the way they treated people were awful especially their customers it was a horrible work environment.
bad,"working here made me sick.  I was miserable. their work practices suck, management sucks. their customer service sucks. expectations suck. Comcast sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks."
bad,"This was by far, the worst company I've ever worked for.  "
bad,"I did not like working hear, They were ghetto. The management was unprofessional and the pay was horrible. I would not recommend working for this company"
bad,They spent more time worrying about laying people off and cutting back on many but kept giving money away to all the customers when we couldn't keep them long enough to make it back
bad,"Extremely chaotic, not enough training which made for inefficient workdays, and poor customer relations."
bad,Company has its ups and downs. Can be a great place to work if you have good leadership. Salaries could use improvement across the board in the retail channel.
bad,.  Comcast does not respect or take care of employees I was administratively let go while being treated for back problems acquired from sitting their bad chairs doing their work for 19 years. Left me with nothing never had a write up never late and always there for them. They moved me 3 times in 3 years w/o compensation ii am 61 years old now w/o work ins or anything
bad,"Appreciate the experience, but unenjoyable for work expectations.  Not a very good work environment.  The only positive was discounted internet, phone, cable."
bad,"Never again will I work for this company! Talk about integrity issues. At the time, as a customer of Comcast Internet and an employee I got to see the ins and out of the apparent #1 internet. As a sales rep, it was my job to call existing Comcast customers to offer them promotional deals that they were eligible for; based on there time as a Comcast customer. One of the biggest rejections I got was, as training predicted, that they didn't want any additional services due to if they didn't pay one the other would get cut off. During training, our trainer states that this is the number one rejection we'd get. Well let just say as my experience as a comcast rep and customer I can say that they at the time trained us to lie. I ended up quitting, and this was one of my reasons. When I questioned the companies integrity during my meeting with head of HR at our location, he asked me why I was quitting so that it was formally documented and when I gave him my reasons I saw him deliberately ignore the fact that I called them into question."
bad,i didnot like this job at all the hours were small and u were expected to meet goal that were unrealistic. the managers listened to phone call then embarrassed you in front of other employesss
bad,"A typical day at Comcast was trying to communicate to staff what needs to done to the extent of giving step by step instructions and monitoring the progress. Management alienates the workers who produced and awards workers who you have to monitor."
bad,"Comcast is not a place where you have growth in the company. Comcast had no room to improve, which is why I left and went to Wells Fargo"
bad,"Left a great job for nothing but broken promises. Took a 5.00 cut in pay to come here and have lost everything. Promised raises that still haven't come. Promised $10.00 pay our for each sale, get check and you got $2.50 for the month? How does that work out? In order to get a better shift, you have to  find someone willing to give up theirs. I was in the 1st class hired here. Good luck!"
bad,"Not only are the males staff completely gross to their woman so are their staff. They stalk everything you do, God bless if the equipment works half the time. If you could deal with being cussed out by customers & lying to them everyday then go ahead but as a woman don't work here."
bad,Never gave enough hours to work and support myself (maybe 3-4 hours every other day) and showed no concern for my home life and the hours they choose to give me...
bad,"company makes changes to cheap employees  commission"
bad,great company the pay was great the environment was wonderful the job itself could be stressful at times but I am very grateful for the experience and would do it again if needed
bad,comcast is very bad to work for.  The use their power as an internet giant to push and pull the system and all of those involved.
bad,I feel Comcast is a very click like work place. None of the sups are ever around when you need them. They don't give you coachings like they should.
bad,"While at Comcast, I supervised 20 direct sales reps.  Every job has good and bad qualities.  The hardest, yet most rewarding part of this job was expanding my knowledge of sales and marketing."
bad,"field work"
bad,comcast used to be a great company but they have lost integrety and will never be able to fix there customer service ranking i would never recomend anyone to work here
bad,"the employees at Comcast were great and supportive, but I can not post anything good about the rest of the company at this time."
bad,"Worst company to work for especially if you actually work!! perfect place for car salesmen and slackers, backstabbers and liars all over that company"
bad,horrible company good for starting off. too many metrics and performance. managers do not like to take escalated calls.
bad,"stress overwhelming, bad constructive criticizm, to make your numbers is unbearable, customer service reps cheat to make their numbers and screw over customers because comcast has made it so awful and almost impossible to make your numbers."
bad,"Poor work hours"
bad,"Great place to work. Great benefits. "
bad,"NA. Was not a very good environment to learn. Seemed more of the type of place where if you weren't a favorite, you were not treated very well."
bad,"Company sent me to Jacksonville for two weeks o n 1 day notice, when the two weeks was up ,they told me if I was to come back to home to Cape Coral they would Terminate my Employment Immediately."
bad,"I was dismissed one minute before going live on the telephone, poor work preformance was the reason when I had never received a chance to apply any training. "
bad,great place to work great people great benefits made a good living  only left to relocate I was on sales team I was ranked 9 out of 180 rep. worked Monday threw Friday 8-5 we had to bid our shifts according to what ranking we were always got my 1st pick  Loved the job always giving prizes for top sales.  Always winning love to compete for highest sales. I like to be challenged and always set my goals very high I want to be the very best at everything I do in my life and I think I would be an assess  to you company.
bad,"This is a very laid back environment. The management was great at this job, co workers reached out to help one another. Most enjoyable part of this job would have to be taking calls and helping the mmebers"
bad,"Pay was low, hours were terrible and the work environment was very stressful. Not sure if this is what the culture is now but this was the culture when I worked there."
bad,Just because the name of the company is well known does not mean it is a great place to work. They have zero loyalty. Have been there long enough to see the mistreat of several employees.
bad,"Worked for Comcast as a summer job. My job was to sign people up for TV, Internet and Phone package. I would have to travel door to door to sign people up for the Comcast package. I have Comcast now and I love it but I am sure it was different in 2009."
bad,"I worked as a Technical Support Rep for 1 year. In training, the company seemed so professional and customer driven. Once I graduated from training it was another story. "
bad,"This was by far my worst employment experience. From everything to the work hours, the management, the direction of the company, and the verbal abuse for 8+ hours a day. No work/life balance, not even the courtesy services this job provided made it a good place to work."
bad,"Poor management, poor training, and poor customer service. High stress environment with a lot of over time required. then end."
bad,Terrible you get moved from area to are i the same time frame and get no additional time to complete jobs added. It was a good experience but as time went on it got worse.
bad,"My experience within the Customer Security Assurance Department at Comcast was terrifying.  I have a degree in psychology, I witnessed evidence of emotional abuse of employees by managers.  These managers would make fun of subordinates during meetings and would encourage other subordinates to make fun of that same employee.  This type of ideology is pervasive within the culture at Comcast."
bad,"Don't do it, it's a trap. It will steal your soul on a daily basis until there's nothing left of you. Seriously, don't. ...are you still thinking about it? Spot it! Stop. It."
bad,"Not a great place to work if you want to advance. There is a lot of negatives there and a lot of favoritism. It is just a job, I am looking for a career."
bad,"Comcast doesn't care about it's employees, if they could make you slaves they would. All those horror stories you hear about comcast are all true. You are incentivized to waste people's time so they get frustrated and hang up on you instead of canceling their service. They trick customers with sales gimmicks that have variable expiration dates and couple that with extremely bad communication. They also lie to their employees about promotions and technical knowledge which creates an air of misinformation or outright lying to their customer base."
bad,"Comcast Spotlight is an aristocracy rather then a work performance culture.  Family and friends will get hired externally over internal candidates seeking to move up.  There is a 200% plus turnover rate amongst Traffic Coordinators.  Management does not support this role and the sales team can make any claim they want against a Traffic Coordinator.  I had 6 supervisors in 3 years.  Record lows on Credo Results.  In the 3rd year they where not even going to let us see the results until someone filed a complaint through Comcast Listens.  And if you do use Comcast Listens you will be targeted.  Management does not honor Credo or company policy unless you are a favorite.  No action will be taken against managers for misconduct and there has not been any changes in management with these results.  There is not advancement and raises whether you perform well or not will be 1-1.5%.  This position is high stress, low pay and no support."
bad,"everything is ok"
bad,"The job itself is very stressful, there is a lot of strife between existing co-workers."
bad,"BOOOOOOO *throws tomato* Terrible. Terrible atmosphere, terrible job, terrible."
bad,Long hours.  Lots of expectations that were difficult to meet.  Management is mosty male dominanted and you can feel the power struggle.  Was told it was family friendly and schedule and work place would be changed to benefit my family life and once I was hired that was not true.  Not a family orientated company although they like to claim they are.  If you dont like it you WILL be laid off.
bad,"have no interest in resolving problems, always say they will do something but rarely do"
bad,"Fun atmosphere however, poor management. Excelled within the first 2 weeks. Strong busy environment."
bad,"sorting items"
bad,"The was only temporary, the benefit i got out of it was my forklift certification."
bad,I hate this company with a passion that is my option i have nothing else to say about this company
bad,filing a wrongful termination lawsuit against them. they were very prejudice
bad,"I worked happily for 6 years at Comcast, then they changed management completely and treated the employees as though they were the enemy. We were blamed for everything and we were hunted as firing people cut costs. I saw all of my friends being treated so badly it was sickening,some of it was illegal. I started to get sick and throw up on the job from the horrendous stress. I wasn't the only one. Finally, one day I got sick of it and got up and left. I wasn't the only one, to this day, two to three people walk out daily. Now they spend all their money hiring new people who last about 6-8 months. "
bad,"I had multiple phone interviews, then had to wait 2 weeks to set up the in person interview. "
bad,With the job I did at I was able to meet and work with a bunch of great people.
bad,"My degree and time spent with the company should speak for itself, but no recognition is given"
bad,I enjoyed working for Comcast. The company is a little unorganized. But overall it a work environment that I enjoy.
bad,Not a fair company. Will work you all the time without any recognition.
bad,"supervisors don't assist agents, no room for growth unless you are doing something inappropriate for your boss"
bad,"Pointless at having management, the customers are exactly right! Why would they invest in a company thats supposedly #1 in everything and the equipment doesnt work properly. Its amazing of the prices customers go thru and cannot get there money worth. As far as working for the company, the best thing was the company benefits as far as INSURANCE other than that, it is quick money that is decent for those with no degree and a HSD/GED but very stressful and may not be worth it to some."
bad,"A typical day would be coming in 15-30 minutes early to get prepared and sort through the numerous emails that don't pertain to you. Then clock into a system that frequently boots you out and shuts down for no apparent reason. The fun part being while on the phone with a customer and having to restart your computer multiple times as they scream in your ear because we can't help them."
bad,"I accepted employment because I needed Healthcare, despite a very low salary offer with all of my experience and skills, I felt robbed with no dignity.  After 8-week Training (which does not  give actual job performance) I quickly realized Supervisor's had no Communication or People Skills, and basically avoided dealing with Irate Customer issues, but quickly passed the Buck. My actual Training began on the floor, which included my years of Customer Service Experience that enable good repore with customers daily."
bad,"It's close to one of the worst employers that I have seen....Poor pay, bad management and slave labor mentality. Comcast only cares about your numbers...."
bad,for the position in retention they don't pay the employees what i feel they deserve
bad,"This job is tailored to the unskilled laborer while the company is as capitolist as one company can be.  Centered more on sales and less on its customers, this company exploits its frontline workers with contradicting metrics and excessive changes (for the benefit of managerial appearance) in an effort to secure personnel who will be mezmorized by fancy titles, free cable and the promise of iPads should they comply with company lies. "
bad,This company treated their employees with little regard. The compensation was not high enough for the number of things an entry level employee was expected to do. The company put speed over quality. The job security was constantly threatened. And benefits for employees were next to non-existent.
bad,New management has made the workplace very unreliable and inconsistent.
bad,I was not told that I will loose my job if I did not sale their products to customers that have services that are not working and continue to fail the customer.
bad,went through training process but did not go further with campaign.
bad,I learned about working hard in a fast pace setting. Dealing with customer issues and promptly handling them. i work well with others and take on the managing role.
bad,Each day started at 7:00am and lasted until when ever. The main thing I learned is that no matter how hard you and your staff works when you have someone above you that has no knowledge of what he is managing. Then compounds things by using others as human shields to save his job. The only thing you can do is try to protect your people.  The staff and most of the local management are dedicated and have a pro customer stance.  The hardest part of the job is when upper management was told what and how to fix a problem if it involved money.  The problem fix was either delayed several months or never done.  The best part of my job was leading a very dedicated and hard working group of people that respected me and would move mountains if and when I asked them.
bad,eh i worked there a long time ago. its good for people that live to work and work to live.
bad,"horrible work enivorment management was terrible, co-workers were nice"
bad,"Received all sort of payments, orders and invoicing."
bad,no one cares about you or the customer just their commission
bad,Not a good place...sweatshop. Horrible managers and corporate. Do not work here unless you are about to lose your home.
bad,They have a very professional and very good communicative workers.
bad,"My daily dutes included processing service orders, for cable, internet and phone,"
bad,"Very brutal environment  a few long calls or a disgruntled customer on the phone and your metrics are ruined.  They say do everything for the customer but if you take more than 11 minutes your job is in trouble.   Also they added selling to the job description which made the job more difficult."
bad,"They try to get you in the door with a Big smile that turns south during your 2nd to 3rd week of training, ""good benifits"" like PTO, good health insurance options, good pay for the first two months at $15 an hour and then you are back to $10.30 when you get back on the floor. The managers are not very helpful. The floor managers are not there to help you if you need help. They force you to depend on a computer software to answer all of your questions. The software is not always accurate.  The training process Sucks in my opinion! You learn NOTHING AT ALL that would help you to be able to work succesfully on the floor. I would never advise anyone to work for this retention call center ."
bad,Bad environment and unethical practices. Poor leadership.
bad,"Comcast is a slave driving company, where they don't pay squat and you work your tail off. Benefits sucks, equipment sucks, management sucks, physical condition of the network sucks. A typical work day is as follows: morning meeting with management where management will belittle you and consistently down the work of the employees. Check you route for the day to determine what equipment you will need to take out, most of the time you can not get the proper equipment due to poor warehouse management. Head out for the day and run into equipment issues when trying to activate causing you to run behind. By the end of the day you have 1 or 2 jobs where you couldn't get to and now you will have to answer to management for that and they don't want to hear any excuses. Then you get to come in the next day and do it all over again."
bad,these companies that advertise all the time are the worst Comcast is at the top the only reason people stay is because their old and can't get another job they do not care about their employees just like Pizza Hut firing a manager for wanting to help his employees
bad,"-Answer calls"
bad,Very poor working environment.  Management treats you like a dog.  NO RESPECT!!.  Tough job because people are calling in to complain about their service.  Management makes it tougher because they constantly criticize and are not available when needed.
bad,I was employed with Comcast for 3 1/2 years and was treated with no value or like a dependable employee as I was. I don't recommend employment with Comcast for anyone.
bad,I typical day at wk was from 10 til night fall. go door to door selling cable. asking the customers are they interested and selling the product to them .The hardest part of the job was going door to door. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
bad,This place has a high turn over rate and is very stressful as you deal with unhappy customers day in and day out. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"clock in and out type of positions. many back to back irate customers must have thick skin and approachable personality. if you can leave work at work and home at home it'll work out."
bad,Low pay and treat u like slaves.....No teamwork or moral and everyone looks after themselves
bad,"This is a horrible place to work.  The metrics for customer service are way to hard to achieve.  If you have three bad metrics your fired no matter how good you are,"
bad,You sign into your phone and are mirco managed you work holidays and are never appreciated for what you do. You are screamed at all day by customer who want something for nothing. You have to be able to say the correct words at all times or your review will be terrible.
bad,"These people hired me and about 40 other individuals through a government assistance program, they fired all of us. They had people sleeping with each other on the job and if you didn't either get in bed with a shift manager or kiss some butt you weren't noticed.  The whole company is a fluke.  Hated my whole time there."
bad,"Management was horrible. They lied about the job requirements, what I would be doing, and the pay. They took some of my belongings when I left."
bad,"If you're considering working for Comcast, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. Keep in mind, that no matter how hard you work here, you will NEVER get ahead. There is NO upward mobility. Management is useless, as they have never done our job & are usually unavailable anyways. They're too busy with their conference calls, socializing, personal calls and schmoozing with the higher ups."
bad,"Comcast is not committed to their employees. The company's Credo states they are family friendly. About 200 employees in Memphis, TN would disagree. They are unemployed due to the ""elimination of positions"", many after ten plus years of commitment to the company."
bad,"A typical day at work was usually routine, two breaks one lunch, the work environment was rarely clean, at times I would have to clean my work station from the employee who was previously there. Shifts varied weekly. Training was not accurate for the job, I learned what to do once I got on the phones and started actually navigating my way through the different software and with help from co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being time effecient and learning at the same time. For me the most enjoyable part was knowing that I accomplished something with little or no help."
bad,Worked on monthly accounting reconciliations and closed the books on a monthly basis.
bad,The pay does not compensate for what you have to go through to get the job done. There is no room for advancement and the management has very little experience in ethics.
bad,"go out work from 12pm to 8 pm then never get a break or get paid, the job was closer to a scam then to a real job i was there for a month and never got paid the money they owed me."
bad,"this is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for, I learned that if the management does not like the person that you are they will make your day hell. What I learned is that you have to be a top sales person in order to ""fit in"""
bad,Work there for over 10 years you will love to hate this job !!!! Stay away Comcast is great but not in Jacksonville good old boy system.
bad,"My typical day at comcast, felt like I was already living in hell. The management was the worst. They company doesn't care about anyone that considered a CAE. They stand by the side of leadership, even if they are the problem causer. All people there considered management, never do anything, all they do is sit at there desk talk to each other, or on facebook, or just leave the building when they want. I would rather deal with screaming customers than our management, and come on that is saying something. Now if you are thinking of applying please re-think it, and wonder if this a place you want to invest your time in."
bad,Poor training and leaders. Everything is matrix driven and the expectations are too high. A few people succeed while the majority struggle each month.
bad,"I found the people on certain teams to be the worst brand of corporate types. Very office oriented, very fake, very cut-throat. If you want to be disillusioned with life then please by all means work there."
bad,"working for comcast was very stressful, having to meet a sales number when i was hired for repair"
bad,"Management is very laid back, no training program. Poor wages but good benefits"
bad,There is very little upward movement. Few people in the company know what they are doing.
bad,I have never been treated so badly at a company..I have at least 15 friends that started when I did and all were <released > for no reason at all. I would sugust if you just want a temp job its ok but be prepared to be callled the worst names you have ever heard as for management they are unprofessional and no one is ever available to help you or take supervisor calls. NO part was fun it is a dread every day and lots of people leave crying everyday.
bad,company treats its front-line employees terrible need to be more safety and customer service driven
bad,"They fire for poor reasons - ANY reason and without warning or ""write ups."" They will keep the most dysfunctional of employees and managers. Many managers do not have college education. They are so awful to employees that they are lucky they are not unionized. In fact, they are the only company that makes me WANT to pay union dues. This is a job you take because you have to - there is a recession and no one else is hiring - when times get better, get the heck out of there!"
bad,Training was inadequate. Management was impersonal. I did not meet my supervisor for 3 weeks after I had been on the floor. I worked there nearly a year and was ultimately fired because I did not meet the metric of 14 calls per hour even though I collected well above average dollars. The job is a real grind. You talk to mostly deadbeats and wellfare recipients that can't or don't pay their bills. They can be rude and abusive and you can't hang up. Sups rarely take calls or give support. Pay was average for a call center.
bad,I wounded wish a job with comcast on my worst enemy. Comcast is not a family friendly company. Management is close minded on how to do things better. They don't care about the customer it is all about the spreadsheets (Making the numbers look good) This company really needs to go union.
bad,this is one of the worst companies i have ever worked for. The pay is horrible and so is the managers.
bad,"They see you as a number, not as a valued employee! Make sure you make money for the company, otherwise, you are very expendable! You will not go anywhere with value in your heart."
bad,This company is not employee friendly. The management team is very unprofessional. The pay is no where near what it should be however the benefits are amazing
bad,"They dont care about your safety they will steal your ideas "
bad,People in high position that don't have a clue to what's going on in the stores. Comcast is not family oriented. Comcast doesn't give back to the community it serves....
bad,"Concast can be explained easily:"
bad,Best to look for another place to work at. Management always looking for some illegal way to get customers to sign up for more. Plus most customers will try to scam you and waste your time and not get commissioned for what you sold because customers will cancel account under one name and reconnect under a different name to get new customers pricing. Customers always find a way to scam you when getting Xfinity mobile either with the rebate offered or discount offered for being  an Xfinity data customer. At the end I work for commissions but with all these customers scams that were allowed at the store it was impossible to make any money because there wasn't any official structure from the top. They said sign customers up for video because it'll look good for the stock holders even if most are reconnect that means no commission. But for the sales rep they would have to answer to management as to why their numbers are down.
bad,Job very stressful all about numbers pay is horrible no advancement if any pick favorites regardless of your qualifications there is really no opportunity they make it impossible to progress
bad,"Company try to trick you at every paycheck, cheating with job order and try to pay you less , put on you a lot a responsibility but can fired you for any reason"
bad,"Despite acknowledging anxiety as a ""disability,"" Comcast will not make any reasonable concessions for your mental health, and will often close one department & give their work to another, so you either have no job security or are overwhelmed with more work than is reasonable to expect a single employee to do. The wage scale is horrible as well. I spent over 10 years in the same department, and barely moved up despite earning advancement with my performance, and could only get wage increases up to what people with no-to-little company experience were being hired into our department at. The only way to get substantial wage increases is to ""department hop"" throughout the company, which I don't agree with, as that doesn't seem very loyal or stable."
bad,They promote people for fraud of placing services on customer accounts they didn't ask for. People who would do this got trips and ipads weekly from company.
bad,"I would say Comcast is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They could care less about your personal life if it is not pertaining to Comcast. They will use you to get what they want accomplished and not advance you or pay you for the extra work you are putting in. Management sucks, they are not trained to be in cx service yet along management"
bad,"Comcast Colorado Springs, Vicky Boston is out there chopping heads, behind closed doors she says one thing and fake on the floor. Supervisors and consultants are scared to death there. They claim it’s good to be outside the box, that is not true they actually want you in the box. They definitely lead by fear,"
bad,"High Risk Department is not wher you want to start , it will leave you with a bad taste and regrets. Daily insubordination by reps with supervisors and no action taken. A very young hostile work environment"
bad,"Impossible sales goals to meet."
bad,"No opportunities to further career, working EVERY weekend, seniority no longer means anything , no training available, must learn everything on the fly, customers suffer"
bad,"You will be taking nonstop calls from customers who are upset because their bill went up, the equipment isn't working or because they were duped by a shady agent into buying something they didn't want and you have to answer these calls by reading a script that's supposed to make these customers buy even more services than what they already have. Of course, the only thing you will get by following this approach  is to make the customers even angrier."
bad,awful place to work.  thank goodness cable internet came around to save them.  horrible customer service terrible installs and worse management.  would not work there again.
bad,"Comcast did not value me as a long-standing employee, I worked for Comcast for 26 years, I was placed on a pilot team called CAM, was not a friend of anyone in position, when the pilot started falling apart the supervisor returned to her previous position, other team members were able to go back to their previous positions, as for me I was being forced to be a BAE or resign, so I resigned after 36 years with nothing to sorfor it. you are told to show empathy for our external customers, but none is shown for the internal customers. I was told to resign so I can go back to customer service, but it was a lie, just as the CAM position was."
bad,Company is a disaster.  Ridiculous goals and no support to get them met. They constantly remove positions to different states and have no idea on valuing employees.
bad,"When I first started working for Comcast, they stated that it was very easy to move up within the company.  What they failed to say was that you had to be a favorite among your management in order to make those kinds of strides for your career.  There is very little opportunity to advance within this company, unless you kiss the proverbial ring of all of your managers, and then there may only be opportunity to move up within your area which you were hired within.  If you start as a Technician, heaven forbid you actually utilize your mind to become more than the knuckle-dragger that you are perceived to be.  It does not matter at all that you may have a college degree and any appropriate training/certifications to become something more than what you were hired to be."
bad,The training at the position that I had was not very good. You do not receive the training needed to help in your position or to build a good base that you need to hold a good living.
bad,"this is not a good place to work they care very little about the employee and their clients.  They show one price but will not honor it to people that are clients, only for new people."
bad,"Upon hire, I was informed that the company practices promotions by hiring from within; however, that was not the case. My position was tech support tier one, billing, and upsell for cable, internet and telephone. The moment I answered the phone, the customers were irate, swearing at me, and calling me nasty names. This happened every day, all day long. It was my duty to deescalate the call by displaying empathy, troubleshooting the issue, and then upsell products. It was a very stressful position, but I worked there for five years. After that, I ran out of patience, and I decided that my mental health was worth more than the paycheck that Comcast could pay me."
bad,There was no drive to progress or any room for advancement. Only the well experienced technicians would get minimal bonuses. It was hard to find the managers because the were also operating out of a truck on the other side of the state/out of state.
bad,Leaving this job was the best decision ever. This is the only company that would rather keep people in a job they know they aren't good at and expect them to succeed. They have so many departments too. I started 3pm-12am with Tues and Thurs days off. I was stressed and felt like I had no life. The metrics are ridiculous the goals are ridiculous and management was awful. The only good thing about the job was the discount and it wasn't worth it to stay. Also there's a lot of drama.
bad,Management was dishonest about training and advancement opportunities. Work was often rushed with little help from co-workers who were also struggling. They encouraged competitive behavior among co-workers that created a hostile culture for techs. Supervisors would encourage techs to be dishonest with customers and encouraged price gouging and padding of jobs to meet quotas.
bad,Poor management & poor work ethics. Pushed more the sale of products than helping fix customers issues. All Metrix was based on sales not work performed
bad,"There is none. HR is a mess. Most offices are fine, but if you get a bad manager, its ripe for bullying, harassment, retaliation - all the big no no's. And they will invent reasons to fire you. There's no accountability on their side."
bad,The job would have been easier with better training. What I learned was to take a lot of notes which would help with the next complicated call. I didn't work there long.
bad,"the disconnect in the management chain must be by design for deniability reasons, the culture was toxic, lying was not only ignored but encouraged and coached, profit and winning at the expense of everyting else, customer service hahahahahaha! pass the buck until they get frustrated and hang up, very well earned poor reputation"
bad,"In my time with Comcast I found the to be very unfocused and disorganized.  I was in a mid level management position and for the most part was not supported appropriately nor did I have the resources needed to do an effective job. For the most part, senior management did not listen to my needs and concerns, nor accepted my recommendations."
bad,"Company cares only about the $$. Zero care for employees. Upper management pretends to listen but doesn't follow core values of the company. Upper management provides information that doesn't sync with company policies, but writes employees up due to having falsified knowledge."
bad,"I initially liked this job, had good hours and benefits, the pay was reasonable; however the company shifted in its focus from customer oriented to sales oriented and everything went downhill."
bad,"Metrics are totally based on call times; if the issue is more complicated too bad. Not responsive to customer needs and resolving customer issues. Mandatory up-sell every support call, so if you get a call from a customer with service disconnected for non-payment and you can't get a payment you STILL NEED TO UP-SELL. "
bad,"Bad place to wor, cut throat, mandatory overtime, take home work with no pay cut throat employees,management . I do not recommenced this place to  work"
bad,"rather than hire people, company hires you for less work you harder . under paid threw contractor never available to answer questions, I had  worked a month before a badge given a month before  i found better"
bad,"The WORST company to work for.  They treat their employees like they treat their customers.....poorly.  Run, don’t walk away from this h-hole.  They will burn the life out of you."
bad,"I would not recommend this for a parent. This job does not work well with having families and kids. It was hard to manage both, but it is good for single individuls with no kids"
bad,It is not worth it. From the interview process to the end it was not pleasant. If you have anxiety do not even think of working here...................
bad,You work very hard and locations are always understaffed. No help from management. No support at all. They don't know what they are doing and never seek an answer to questions asked.
bad,The company was restructured three separate times in the years I was there. No-one was comfortable that they would have a job at the end of the day. It was quite difficult to know whether or not your friends would be there next week let alone next month. Constant pins and needles.
bad,Typical day at Comcast  most time is stress full                                                    The most think I learn at Comcast interactive with  customers.              Management doesn't know what there doing losing more customers to direct tv.workplace culture is very stress full management wants you to work from 730am to 630pm sometimes no lunch or half of lunch the hardest part of the job is trying to interact with customer that paying a lot of money for their service but not receiving it so that's makes them angry and then that's makes you on the other end of the stick
bad,"The worst company I have worked for.  Micro managed,  Incompetent supervisor who wanted me out of there asap as soon as I said I got another job. Very fast paced environment.  They think of you as slaves.  Ask them why there is a high turnover and why they hire 20 people or more every 4 months,  because all they care about is the inbound calls and nothing else. If you love being micro managed  & love being a slave,  this is the job for you.  Also a good place to start a job and keep interviewing elsewhere."
bad,"I am sorry to say this was the worst work experience I have ever had."
bad,"Working for Comcast was not the best experience. Cut throat atmosphere. I learned a lot that got me to the next level. I had never heard of the concept, ""Throw you under the bus"", until I started working for Comcast."
bad,I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you about this place. Management treats hourly employees very poorly. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.  The job is extremely stressful and physically demanding.
bad,"Comcast prefers to hire people based on who they know, not what they know,  which results in unqualified folks holding manager positions and making very poor decisions. In 2 years of employment more than 10 managers and 3 Market Managers have been terminated due to poor decision making. This was a direct result of taking poor orders from the Top Down, and entry level managers not using common sense when executing those orders."
bad,The fleet Department is poorly managed.  Stefani Ducote does not care about her employees she is cut throat and a horrible manager.  On a team of 7 6 reported her and nothing happened.  Poor management.  She is in it for herself and her best friend is the fleet manager which lets you know you have no clear voice.
bad,"Too many metrics for not enough compensation. Comcast doesn't have a great track record and the customers know it so they use you as a sounding board when they are unhappy. I would hazard a guess that half of the call volume was angry customers and the "" wheres my tech"" phone call was a good one but rightfully so, the customers should be mad, most of the time but it still doesn't give them the right to be jagoffs."
bad,"I worked in the Cloud Desk department. The general management style is that of negative reinforcement and lies. There is little to no transparency between management and sales reps  regarding possible sales leads. They feed ""good"" leads to certain people and everyone else gets recycled garbage that no one else could close on. "
bad,Employees were treated very poor.  You only got the $2.00 bonus if you met every goal and did not get written up for everything.  They would go through firing phases to get rid of the employees that were getting paid too much.
bad,I was less stressed being unemployed than working for Comcast customer service. The call center is the work place ever. Maybe the stores are better but do not work for the call center.
bad,"There needed to be some type of review done on management and their own policies that they were setting on a local basis.  Management decided that services needed to be forced on customers and with that decision they decided that CSR/Front Counter wages were going to be cut by 30% and you had to make that difference up in sales.  If you did not meet your sales goals in each and every month then Comcast had the right to fire you.  However in the meeting to notify employees of the changes it was stated ""wages were not being cut"" then when asked the question by someone ""so your going to cut our pay"" it was stated ""well no, because you can make the difference up in sales""  They were cutting pay in order to force the sale and I know this because my hourly pay rate was getting cut.  After all the time I had been an employee cutting and hourly pay was not a way to help moral"
bad,Worked there three years glad to have left at first it was all good like a new relationship until true colors are shown. Real get the job done at all cost place lies to customers and employees i left because i was tired of lying.
bad,Managers and leadership only see you as a way to move up the ladder. You will get stepped on and pushed out of the way. Employees treat you as bad as the customers do. A lot of excessive work with no regard to personal life. Don't even think about trying to take a day off or vacation.
bad,"No opportunity for growth here. Middle managers make a lot of money and stay for a very long time. Account Executives are considered second rate employees, and are required to manage an enormous work load with no direction or leadership. Compensation is poor and changes every year. There is no possibility for creative input, work/home balance or flexibility. Comcast does offer excellent benefits. If you work very hard and don't mind being micro-managed, you can make some decent money, but base salaries are very low, and commission structure is very confusing."
bad,"Not willing to return. Worst job in my career, most of my coworkers were disgruntled. Customers and employees have unrealistic expectations, overall bad experience."
bad,"Comcast cable company is not a great place to work. The benefits seem nonexistent and the compensation package is mediocre. The management staff are not leaders and more often than not cause the day to day process to become worst which is not helping the customers. The Elmhurst,IL site in particular."
bad,"Working here is terrible. You are placed on the phones all day except breaks and lunch and the occasional meetings which get cancelled all the time. You take 20-40 calls and every single call effects what is called your close rate which effects your pay. if you sell something you get paid. but if it is not what the company wants you to sell it can range in pay from 0-8 dollars. the best stuff are the biggest packages. which pay you 50 dollars. but they are much much harder to sell. in addition to that the company doesn't want you asking straight out questions; like ""do you want home phone service?"" or ""what are you doing for home security"" they want you to position the question to customers in a way that they don't know exactly what you are asking. like ""how do you protect your belongings"" or ""how do you keep in touch with friends and family"" it's tedious.  EVEN if the customer is only calling in for internet. you have to go through and ask these questions. its frustrating for both the customers and for the employees. and they want you to tell people that we don't have promotions for just tv and internet only or even internet by itself and if you want the best deal then you have to bundle more service. you're only pulled for coachings if you are doing something wrong. now that my quality scores are at a high percent i don't get pulled unless they feel like i'm not ""asking effective questions"". also we have calls that come into the queue which aren't even for our department. which that effects you negatively. you get your pay lowered for every single call you take that doesn't"
bad,"40 hour week. NOC, Sys Admin, Sys analyst, Build Eng. Co-workers are jealous and disgruntled. Most emotional dump on you and are unprofessional. Hardest part was dealing with people that don't have the education to move forward in their career but because of corp policy can't be fired for extreme poor performance. Management used me to set an example for there benefit but back-lashed on me. Comcast lost the buy out for Time Warner. Budget cuts everywhere. Laid off because Boss wants better chemistry on the team. More like you want Drones."
bad,"One of the weakest performing call centers is destined to get worse with its reliance on old, dated sales strategies and employee management."
bad,Low pay for the type of work they want you to do supervisor always on your back about you numbers. Your van will most likely be a piece of junk high mileage rattling. my supervisor was old and forgetful I was a new hire in i had to figure out lots of things on my own he couldn't even help me set up my iPhone said he doesn't like to with technology you figure it out witch I did. watch your pay closely because they don't like to approve your time you worked hard for just overall bad company to work for they just want you to install cable and shut up and please don't be late for an appointment you'll never hare the end of it and be prepared to go in some dirty and disgusting houses good luck.
bad,"Pay is low for call center, you are expected to sell, sell, sell instead of solve customer issues.  Management is a joke, more concerned with making sure you don't spend more than thirty seconds finishing notes than helping with irate customers."
bad,"You must humble yourself as an Employee… A lot of favoritism is given to those that Management want to help advance to the next level in their career. If you're are under the age of 23, the Call Center in North Fulton Co. would be a great place for you. You'll have to market yourself in order to advance and move up in this company. The compensation isn't worth the headache and stress… This location needs better structure. Not to mention it's very unprofessional there. Dress code needs to strictly enforced addressed. The job I perform here isn't at all the problem. It's location and Mgmt. that's the upside down part about being an employee for this company."
bad,"Sweat shop, They lure you in with all the excitement but then it gets real when you see management does not try to assist in anyway but to write you up."
bad,"schedule is good but mgmt promises you things that they never deliver on, compensation is not what they say it is, paycheck is completely out of your hands."
bad,"Work is assign via telephone daily.   The  most enjoyable part  of the job, is the interaction with customer and solving problems."
bad,As a contractor working with comcast everything is modular. do your job and go home. It's not a lot of learning going on because for every contractor there are Two comcast employees.
bad,"They start you out at $10.50 the turnover rate is astounding....The expectations are outrageous...they don't want quality people if you quit oh well don't expect them to try and convince you to stay...they started a new career advance program that is such a joke..if you go up a level you then have to keep increasing over the original goals which are near impossible to attain anyway and maintain them or youre out the door...they don't care about the churn rate....all they care about it is the bottom line....if you've been there a long time youre capped off on salary NO raises ever anymore...just a once a year payout, I was there 12 years and was making $19.75 they phased out our dept and to keep my job I could go into customer service on the phone with a pay cut to $10.50 an hour LESS than I started out 12 years earlier.......but keep tenure and benefits..."
bad,"Little to no training."
bad,"Comcast.... do not properly train and expect you to know the job, i would not recommend this job to anyone. This is the retention department in Michigan."
bad,"Unless you're desperate...don't do it. Make sure you are looking elsewhere if you resort to taking the job. Mgmt is dishonest, commission matrix is unreachable if you are an honest person. Most reps withhold information in order to close customer sale. Favorable reps are streamlined the true sales calls. Newbies get heavy billing/collection calls. When you first start training, they brainwish you into believing you've struck something great and will earn lots of $$. Just remember...if it seems too good to be true, watch out!"
bad,Answer in coming calls. the range of the call and troubles were all different. Learned how to deal with irate customers and a management team which had no knowledge of how ro handle an escalation. I woeked with a good team. dealing with the management team. the team I worked with.
bad,"This company promises you the moon and stars...but all you get is a big fat nothing!"
bad,"Great people, learned that you don't question anything."
bad,"If you enjoy broken promises, terrible management, and a corrupt company then Comcast is the BEST company to work for! I don't know how many times, me working in retention, was told when a customer was promised something and we did something different, was told on numerous occasions by MANAGEMENT, yea that happens, just keep them at what they currently have because no notes means it didn't happen right?... Terrible company and that Minnetonka location needs to be looked at ASAP, I don't think that is how the founder wanted this company run."
bad,Local leadership is more concerned with personal ego's then they are about internal/ external customer service. A very hostile work environment.
bad,"Great job for customer service..if you are ok dealing with corporate B.S. I worked at this company for over 5 years. When I started, it was a great job, very customer service focused. Lately its turned solely into a sales job, customer service no longer exists. Management repeatedly would say to not spend a whole lot of time with the customers and sell sell sell. If the customers had any issues, we were told to have them call into the call center to resolve their issues. I felt (and still feel) like customer service isn't in their vocabulary any longer."
bad,"Comcast has no standard operating procedures or accountability.  These two factors alone create a consistently chaotic environment for operations.  "
bad,"This was an inbound call center where you wouldn't know what the next call would be.  I've learned the true meaning of ""the customer is always right""."
bad,"I worked at outreach communication for comcast we had access to customers full history comcast over charges I would always have people arguing with because they would bearly pay and would owe 600$ more. It was a horrible experience working with this company,the pay was not good for what we worked and did. Management would always come and yell at us never would make up there minds,we would have to train new hires and teach them how to speak and use the computer always interrupted us from getting the payments. For me it was a horrible experience working for outreach and taking payments for Comcast and also customers would call because they would pay n services wouldn't be restored,or something was wrong with cable and would wait for tech to come n wouldn't,and not only that the tech people wouldn't even berry the wires correctly underground,I would get those calls alot. I can keep going on and on why you shouldn't get Comcast but it would take me for ever to finish this but this is what you would get if u choose Comcast!!"
bad,Management is not good.  My co-workers were there before me and all are not happy individuals.  Was laid off
bad,I have worked alot of bad jobs. Working for comcast was the worst. It is a people mill you come in on one end get ground up and spit ou on the other. The rate we were told people quit at is about 60% in 6 months. Your monitored every minute your at work and must meet quota or be kicked out. I lasted 2 yrs and still hate it everytime I think about the place.
bad,They have great benefits but they have a high turn over. No flexibility on schedule. If you're sick you have to either take the points or come to work. Personal experience I had a doctors notice due to my fever my supervisor said the note didn't matter. But if you like to work in a dirty call center and receive good benefits and pay nothing for your cable and Internet then go for it! But be prepared to sale sale sale. Quantity over quality is  the motto. No stability unless you are good in sales.
bad,"Job is easy, dealing with all the noice per se is not. One hand definately does not shake the other. No meetings for updates, just emails and forms."
bad,"your supervisor is in the same training class as you, and when you hit the floor they start as your supervisor with NO kind of experience on the calls, then when they are coaching us they think they know everything about the calls but they dont even have the experience on taking the calls."
bad,"Opened office, took customer service calls, scheduled repair or installation appointments, took between 20 and 50 thousand dollars in daily payments, made daily deposits.I liked the job nd co-workers but management was terrible. They made no balance for your private life, and just plain stated to me that they didn't care."
bad,"Call center environment. Worked as a floor trainer and a trainer that they sent to other call centers. Ran work order accuracy reports, handled government complaints, and directly escalated complaints from the call center. no support for associates and constant changes in metrics made it difficult to teach a floor and also for the floor associates to keep up with the weekly changing demands. No regard for university schedules and sick leave - which is allotted for your use is counted against you."
bad,It is not a positive environment for a person to work or make a living at that position. Unskilled managers and supervisor that only go with the status quo and not put any push back for implementing local market strategies and plans and there is no consistency in a single goal for the area.
bad,Typical day at work is answering 34 to 40 calls per day. I have not learned much new material as much I have solidified my current knowledge. I don't see management very much as they are in there offices mostly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people on the phone. The most enjoyable part of the day is leaving at the end.
bad,Worked here when I was younger so the money was good I just never had the time to spend it. My life revolved around this place.
bad,while working comcast was not easy at all it was hard for us to get them to work for us. we had to walk around neighborhood to see if they wanted to get cable.
bad,"A VP did something illegal.  I pointed it out. He didn't like it so he sent the company thug to make up a reason to let me go.  They since have fire the two of them and the HR people involved.  But, you would think they would have courage to reach out to me and others who were great employees and ask us back."
bad,"Comcast does not reward good honest hard work. Comcast leaders in Houston are not leaders, they are tasks managers. Benefits are good, and opportunity is good if you strategically align yourself with the right people."
bad,"Perks are cool like discounted tv and take home truck. Besides that, horrible pay for massive amounts of work. Management is always stabbing backs and playing politics. Best part they pay low."
bad,"they say all the right things an expect you to be happy and excited regardless of what they actually do.  Often didn't have tools needed to do the job.  often ignore agents breaking rules to succeed.  constantly changing and poorly measured performance objectives.   I was misled by this company, even about how much and they would pay and how it was calculated for commissions."
bad,"Terrible experience Poor Management No Clear leadership Terrible experience Poor Management No Clear path to succedd"
bad,"The training sucks, then you get stuck with a another tech who is suppose to help you learn more but the don’t care. Then you are expected to understand everything you just “learned”. They don’t care about your safety and if you need help well good luck. Things change everyday and if a customer doesn’t understand how to use there service and another tech goes out it falls on you."
bad,People would bring back boxes full of roaches which made us have to eat in the break room full of bugs. I was sexually harassed and then mistreated by my staff when someone else reported it on my behalf. This place allows fraud on customers accounts as a means to justify revenue. Thee worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"Overall rating"
bad,perks and the fringe benefits were the best.  There's really no work life balance or loyaty in the business.  Really have nothing to say made money moved on....................................................................................
bad,"Wasn't the job they were selling to me during the interview. I left a great situation, because I was under the impression I would be in an even better situation and that just wasn't the case."
bad,"Lazy employees gets better treatment than the hard working ones."
bad,as a dispatch it's who you know not what you know. Lack of commutation and a lot of favoritism. You can call corporate all you what nothing will be done.
bad,"If you are not liked by management, they will find the way to terminate you. Even if you are exciting in your numbers. This job is extremely stressful and can affect your health"
bad,No loyalty to employees. Worked for them for over 13 years and was laid off while at the same time they were hiring jr engineers. Good benefits but not the greatest.
bad,"It's the place that dreams go to die. you're tied to a desk via a headset, and get yelled at by upset customers for eight hours.  Every thing is watched and recorded while you are unable to move, calls are graded each week and you'll never be perfect some how you'll always be able to do something better or add something more to offer"
bad,"If you think dealing with Comcast is ridiculous as a consumer, try being on the inside and still not able to help the customer. Told to route the customer to call the Comcast call center, which just infuriated them even more."
bad,Boss talk to u any kind of way and do not make u feel special and they are disrespectful and mean and the company like to rip off there employees from there money.
bad,leave when you can because it's a soul crushing environment.  i do have to say they pay well in certain roles but if you have any reason to leave.  they very rarily hire from within for jobs and the people they hire have to be trained up from the ground.  there isn't a good reason to stay with them other then the benifits.
bad,Hostile work environment. Management will never have your back. Excepts you’re life to revolve around the job. Job security is a zero. They cut commission on a regular to make up for lose within company. Mentally straining. Not worth a paycheck
bad,They will fire you in a minute but they no that leadership is sleeping with the agent and they do nothing. In my department the Director got the agent pregnant and got her promoted to another department before we found out
bad,"Management never communicated with staff about changes. They just fire people without warning,pay is minimum for the work we are doing. Favoritism in the work place."
bad,"The company itself is cool but the overall managements  are rude ,unprofessional with lack of training and very unorganized.The company could be much better if the managers took time to train a little more"
bad,Comcast was great with there employees 15 yrs ago. But now they care only about making money for them selves. Comcast was a great company but now there money driven and dont share the wealth.
bad,"Typical day includes taking calls from irate callers for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Training does not help you feel prepared to do your job. Set schedules, no weekends off."
bad,I most say at the beginning I was wooed by the money but after being there for a year now things have changed.  After the dust settled and I got past the honeymoon phase is when things started to go down hill from there.  Everything that I learned in training was a waste seeing as how the software changed the day after I was released from training.  And then to add insult to injury we went through a total of 3 site managers in about a 6 month period with the latest one being by far the worst. I thought I was coming into a well oiled machine but that was the furthest from the truth the life work balance is awful the communication is not there no one is ever one the same page policy changed and launch dates are pushed back without notice. And although we have a supervisor help chat rarely does a sup respond in a timely manner.
bad,It was a horrible experience for many years. As a tech you get the brunt of the blame and you are definitely guilty until proven innocent. You never get the mandatory lunch period but by 2021 the span of time will dwindle down to 8 mins so watch what you eat
bad,"I came into company via a facebook post and was very fortunate.  I was apparently trained by the best but probably one of the worst persons to represent a company.  This person's goal was to complete job and leave.  If something didnt work, the person would invent a story.  Company car given was filthy, you must work 6 days a week, 11 hrs a day, but be a 1099? They do whatever they want."
bad,They are very eager to get you going then compilation about your sales no matter how high or low your numbers are they really like to complain.  And part time hours suck.
bad,"It is a metric based job, leadership will aggressively motivate you to meet metrics. If can not hit metrics, you can and will lose you're position. As a tech you will work out in all invironments."
bad,"Evil company. Liars, never go near this place people. They are off the devil. You would be working for the devils devils devils devils devils devils devils"
bad,Poor Management.  Crummy hours.  They change constantly.  Management does not help advance employees unless you are one of their pets.  I do not recommend working here unless you like constant change of your hours.  I used to go in at 6:00 am and off at 2:30 pm.  Then they changed my hours to 12:30 pm to 9:00 pm  No weekends or holidays off for me at all.
bad,"This company has been going downhill for awhile, Management degrades employees, lack of trust, hyper micromanagement, low pay with way to many responsibilities. Make no question they will work you to death, they will expect you to go above and beyond while showing little to no appreciation. Company should be reported to the better business for nepotism in the work place, they have their favorite freinds and family. If you don't have an in, good luck trying to get a job here."
bad,The job at Comcast I had was outside sales with a 3rd party business associated with Comcast. One of the salesmen was very intelligent and knew a lot but was rarely around. The owner was not at all helpful when learning new products or assigning areas of interest. It was poorly ran and managed. Good learning experience but that’s it.
bad,"The work isn’t worth the pay. They’re constantly “training” you for different things but your pay doesn’t change. Managaement plays favorites. Work environment is always hostile. The commission is a joke. The only time you get commission worth something is when you sell a full line of business ie; home phone, mobile, internet etc. And working in priority bulk, is THE worst! You deal with customers who think your job is to kiss their behinds. They feel as though they’re entitled to special treatment. Run away! Don’t waste your time applying. It’s not worth the stress. The work environment is so bad, almost everyone has an open case for mental health. And you’ll start off working 3pm-12am. And the schedule options don’t get any better.There’s so much more I could say but I don’t have the time...."
bad,"Comcast is the worst. Customer are allowed to cuss retention agents out the agent has to take it, disconnecting the call is not allowed. That is abuse"
bad,"I've literally been in a war zone and felt safer than i did working for Comcast, going in and out of crack houses and roach infested buildings. Crawling through 120 degree attics and wet crawl spaces isn't worth $15 an hour. Not to mention, the amount of knowledge you need in order to be good at this job, you might as well study to be a nurse and start at $40 an hour."
bad,"Comcast workers know their work system is flawed, they dont give you a realistic amount of time to do jobs, and then they rate you as an under-performer - then they fire you. Supervisors with low performance scores will throw you under the bus and get you fired, even though they know the employee rating system is flawed. They overbook jobs, and then rake workers over the coals because they cannot make all of the jobs they slapped on them. They are too quick to fire, and wont even let you learn anything once they start the write-up process. Corporate doesn't care if workers are lied on and rubber stamp anything middle management does so they can get back to their yoga and latte sessions. You get training, but they work you like a slave and throw you away."
bad,horrible management also the director is a cold person that does not care about their employees they make it seen like they do but at the end they dont about you.
bad,if you are not a tech or csr. you do not count and your job is not secure even after a decade of service. volunteering to help out is not rewarded. upper management does not care about lower end emploees.they are just worried about their bonuses
bad,Taking customer calls and troubleshooting is fine.   What makes the job stressful is that you have an average handle time and are required to hit specific marks during the call and still get the customer off the phone as quick as possible.  Even though its a support role you are still required to make sales and have a minimum sales requirement that is hard to meet and does end in termination if its not met.
bad,"Upper management has no clue about what retail faces on a daily basis. They will tell you one thing and turn around and tell you you the complete opposite within hours. You are instructed to focus on your team and not get lost in all the email updates but then have to have a discussion on why you did not read an email with important information."
bad,"company has pushy sales tactics. you are expected to hit goals and management pushes sales first customer last. deceptive sales tactics all around. no wonder the company had to change its name to Comcast to Xfinity, was named worst company in America"
bad,The job used to be ok but then they took everyone that was in the solutions dept and turned the site into sales only. I have applied for a supervisor position 10 times and never receive a interview. I do not know if it has to do with my age or not. I do know that I have more management experience and the BA for the position than the resent hires.
bad,"At first, I loved my job, but unfortunately that only lasted for a year. My second year with the company is when it all went downhill. They began a point program of how you got paid instead of a straight dollar amount per product sold which literally cut our commission in half. After about a year of that, they realized they really screwed up as employees were leaving and complaining. I myself had gone from $100,000 plus the year before to $60,000 barely that year and had to sell twice as much. The management was absolutely horrible and the management above them was even worse!! They were constantly taking away special offers you had to sell and making it so people could just call in or go online to get the same deal. Oh if you don’t like constantly being tracked by gps, then you really don’t want this job! You can’t even take a bathroom break without getting a phone call or email asking why you’re off your turf. I’ll finish by saying, they are by far a terrible company to work for and are only getting worse (coming directly from friends who still currently work there) and they don’t care about current customers, only getting their business. Avoid working for them!!!"
bad,"Could not defend/recommend this company on any level. I was hired for retention and was told the metrics were easily achieved. It became a ""chained to your chair"" job."
bad,The Xfinity services is great. However they treat you like trash. The management is not sensitive to family situations. Once you get at a certain pay raise they fire you and replace you with someone else starting them off with less. It’s a very high turnover rate. They treat their workers like slaves.It was times we did not have any water in the building for over eight hours and they wouldn’t let us go home Until the end of the shift.
bad,The benefits are ok but not worth the stress and threats from management.  Management uses the expression of changing the tire of a moving vehicle. But its more like the company keeps upgrading expectations and requirements of the job but does not increase time allotment or pay.
bad,"When i tried to go out of my way to help someone, i would get poor audits. When i didnt hit something that didnt apply on the call but is rated i got bad audits. They put too much pressure to sell new line of business and make you feel bad for not pressuring customers into buying new service on every call."
bad,"Comcast Is Wonderful At First, but after that it’s stressful, exhausting, difficult, and a toxic job to work after starting development bay! Comast ask tooo much from there employees, yes there pay is good but not that good for what the customer rention agents go through. Retention Agents have the hardest jobs at Comcast, and yes its being said But is it really appreciated! They want you to retain the customers,, SALE SALE SALE, hit most of your metrics while giving a great customer services to people who are really fed up. 9/10 the calls are all horrible! I’ve done my job my scorecard was never too bad at all but it’s too much to focus on. Customer don’t care about adding on a product when they already have an issue with our company. They price wayyyy to hard and sometimes I feel like I’m just selling or entering them into another scam. Also management acts like they care but they really don’t do please don’t let them fool with the survey because they will tell you how to do your job but they don’t have to do it! DONT WORK COMCAST UNLESS you want them to swallow your life cause your stress, and anxiety. Because if you do be prepared to get a coaching on trying your hardest."
bad,"Management is on you all the time. There management is on them...they will work you 24/7 if you let them... All about numbers, but talk family and seem to crae about you personally- but Don't!  Let go of outside sales team 10 days before Christmas- all out of the blue. For a large company they should take care of dedicated employees and Care- Plus take care of there customers- they preach customer service, but it's never taken seriously. It's a shame for All"
bad,"Doing the actual work for Comcast is great, but the actual company due to contracting is not something I can support a family with. The money doesn’t match up to the hours."
bad,"It varies from department to department but i would never recommend my department to anyone that i liked. Maybe an enemy or someone i dint like, but I wouldn't inflict that sort of trouble to anyone I actually like. Be careful where you end up in Comcast, some departments are better than others."
bad,"This job gave minimal training and no support, there was poor management and the employees already there were obviously burnt out, was not a good environment"
bad,Comcast is a terrible company to work for. I would not recommend friends or family to work here. Their benefits hide how horrible the company treats their employees
bad,the supervisors and management are poorly trained and poorly operated. Unless you are close friends with them they will not help in your development at all. They will over look someone breaking company policies and lying to customers as long as you are their friends. But if you are someone that does their job instead of worrying about being popular they will not help you and find any reason to fire you.
bad,"I worked for Comcast for almost 3 years in the Repair Department.  Not only do you work as first line in Repair but you also work as part of Sale Team, Retention Team and Billing but your only being paid as a Repair Agent.  The raises that are given are a insult  .21 to .30 cents unless you have FMLA and hardly at work. Comcast expects you to be an Ambassador for them but its extremely taxing hearing everyday how horrible your company is and being insulted by their customers.  You as a human being can't have a bad day on the phone because Comcast doesn't care about their employees they just want every dime from the customer. The expect to make at least $10.00 additional per call.  The company likes to claim they care for their customers but they don't just like they don't care about their employees.  You get vacation days but it is almost impossible to use your time if you don't request time off at the beginning of the year. I wouldn't refer anyone to work in Repair as you work all areas and the company doesn't support you as an employee. They hear something they don't like and your dismissed.  Also they black out days before and after non real holidays Mother's Day, Valentines Day and Super Bowl."
bad,this is forced and I refuse to do this. if you want to know about the company go get yourself a job there. I don't understand why I have to review a company I am clearly trying to leave
bad,Very cutthroat and competitive environment overseen by bumbling middle management while corporate leadership trips over themselves trying to impress executives.
bad,"The problem with the Comcast Media Center is that there are far too many supervisors, managers, and shift leads (basically people whose reason for being is to insure OTHER PEOPLE are working) as opposed to actual operators.  Once these people get a little taste of power, they adopt an attitude more appropriate to upper class Victorian society or a caste system than twenty-first century USA.  As long as you're comfortable keeping your eyes down, your mouth shut, never asking questions, never EVER saying 'no', and bowing low every time one of these people so much as pass you in the halls, you'll probably do just fine.  Heck, you'll probably be run-in the place in twenty or thirty years."
bad,I really did not like working for Comcast.  I was constantly stressed and everyone around me was ready to stab you in the back.  They did not care if weather was bad and you had a tough time getting out of snow for them it just did not matter.
bad,"Comcast started out as a wonderful idea. Once employed, they made a lot of promises to their employees about advancement and job opportunities. One of which was supposed to take place after six months of employment. After over 2 years, these had still not come to fruition. The center was new and understandably had organizational issues due to it being a brand new location, but the sheer number of failed promises and the change in management's app[roach to the employees was sad. They quickly went from a family oriented culture to a standard ""you are just a number"" culture. Supervisors lied, they played favorites and allowed employees to slide on serious breaches of policy as long as they were either top earners or they were friends with the supervisors in question. I personally witnessed one agent get fired for lying to customers and avoiding calls to pad their paycheck and then get rehired by the manager because their numbers were so good ( directly as a result of the unethical behavior)"
bad,"The company can’t quite find the right balance, they hire the executive leaders with no cable experience, just ideas that look great on paper. "
bad,"Upper Management works from top up, not top down. No training is provided. Lot of downscaling going on. Lots of a lot of good people. more work load and stress on local Account Executives and local management"
bad,"The Company has great benefits plus discounted services. Employees are not valued do to their skills or work ethics unless you’re willing to cater to management egos and swallow your dignity, this will ultimately define your career growth. If you have ideas how to improve a process keep it to yourself, management will brush you off because they don’t want to be outshined. There is a good Good Ole Boys system if you plan to be a tech and move up. For call center employees it’s a high turnover (black hole) that will drain the life out of you. The company says it values veterans but that is just for PR publicity as my department was relocated to Denver and I had 15 years in the company and couldn't help me find a job. Coworkers have become good friends that have stayed in touch. Comcast is probably a good company but leadership has decline and been replaced with Yes men. Job security is probably the worst unless you live in the Mecca of Comcast (Denver)."
bad,Decent benefits but pay well below the industry standard. Mgt is unprofessional and sets an environment of harrassment with vulgar language and untasteful humor is the norm. Under constant threats from supervisors to meet unresonable expectations. There are much more professional places in the industry to work where you will be treated with respect and make more money.
bad,Managmwnt was horrible. Unless you had a relationship with them before employment.  Then being late and absence was accepted. No union therefore customers verbal and physical threats were tolerated by company. Pay is unacceptable for the work the company demands.  And you are constantly being told you are replaceable.
bad,"Horrible work enviroment, everyone getting fired for doing shady s***. Put you in the ghetto where you get thraetened all day and they dont take those threats seriously. Employees do what every they want all the time."
bad,shady bosses and sales agents. awful practices and slamming of products onto customers. encourages people to be essentially evil human beings and aren't ashamed of it
bad,The management at the Greenwood village location is very HUSTILE!!!!!  They pick who they would like the winners to be so they can advance and who they would like to fail to keep them at the bottom
bad,was being able to listen to my music while I work. But I also made a lot of great friends along the way. what I did not like is that we did not have any team building events which I think could have helped with the work environment.
bad,"In the business class, IT, corporate and marketing great salary and strategic vision and execution"
bad,Get the calls done in 6 minutes or else! The department I worked in was technical support in a 60+ age demographic. I excelled but the business model kept me from providing what I considered Excellent customer service.
bad,"tough place to work at, upper management do not value their employee the way they show, pay is pretty good overall - need to work on adjustment of schduelding a but more"
bad,"Must be able to work long hours and no set schedule, Hard to have a life outside of work. They do offer free cable and 401k and only match 3%. There is not any job security and unrealistic metrics are set."
bad,"Comcast pays really well, but as a sales agent you will be forced to sell at any cost. Deception is subtely encouraged and customers seem little more than bait for products they do not want. Pressure is always high, and numbers rule your day"
bad,"You do not want to work for West Division in Centennial.  Men are not women friendly.  Expect Finance to be experts in SQL, write reports that do not exist in tables.  No training.  No Onboarding.  Rather than use the BIS group.  Expect you to be a programmer.  "
bad,"Dont do it if you really want a job with security, company does not care about workers only numbers. You are exendable at any time for any reason they seemed fit to say to you no matter what."
bad,"High turnover of employees in the Accounting department, most complained of poor on the job training. The end result was a high turnover of qualified staff accountants."
bad,I worked at Comcast/Alpharetta for about a year and it was the most ghetto place I've ever worked. From managers sleeping with employees to inadequate supervisors. We went almost six months without an HR Director and their open door policy is a joke!
bad,"Once you are hired, you cannot interview for other positions, if you do, you get fired.  "
bad,Management does not back you up. They brag diverse company which was true for every white person there was 10 minority's. Training was great 21 weeks when I went through it but then they cut it to 9 weeks. When I offered to make changes never got any credit due. It's like a high school every will blame other ppl so they can keep there job. Went on leave for medical came back with right ups that made it so I couldn't miss a day.HR is very slow and fixing attendance when you take FMLA leave. So I missed raises and promotions. Brought them doctor notes that stated under the care of such and such doctor. But they still wrote me up to the point of miss a day and you are fired. Another thing with Comcast I would add is when the founder died everyone should have run for the door.
bad,"When you work in tech support you work in the 'people farm'. "
bad,"During my tenure at Comcast, I was promoted 3 times during a 10 year period.   It was an exciting job and customers were fun to work with .  It was a new build when I worked there.  Ithas grown to be empire and still one of  the best company in the country."
bad,"There are better jobs available. slave wages ridiculous hours. No personal life. Work in very dangerous weather. Your welfare doesn't matter just sell sale, sale, even though the products customers have aren't working properly. Customers are being overcharged and robbed."
bad,"Comcast is awful, but people still pay because they cant live without TV and absolutely nothing else in the universe is as important as TV."
bad,"Benefits are good, but that's about it. Outsiders with no experience are hired into higher positions  faster than employees with tenure and experience."
bad,"the company was going through a second re-org, the first re-org I was laid-off and this re-org the manager was telling the employees to find new job, and the manager is telling the contractors that they are fine"
bad,The pay is pretty decent but the environment and the customer service at Comcast is very difficult to deal with. Comcast is not about its employes and will trhow them uder the bus in a beat of a heart. Not a place you would want to work if you were looking to build career.
bad,They promised to hire you on after 6 months of working there. I watched how former employees were let go for no real good reason. They use Temps and tell them to keep applying for the position they have open. Only difference is they give you no chance for interviews and when you do get one after applying 5 times they say you are not experienced enough! I was lied to about the positions. They have their minds made up to choose who they want and after a year and 2 months of being there working hard for them our ties ended based on hear say of another employee temp that started drama. They did not investigate enough to find out the truth! I don't recommend working for this company unless you just need temporary work and work hard for less pay! This company does not have their act together after they bought out Contingent last year leaving clients accounts vunerable to having their services they manage shut off! Not fun when a client is angry for the disruption of their services! Its not just the employees who are suffering the lash back but as well as the clients lash back from their customers! Makes a bad day of a work day! Wish the company was never sold to Comcast!!
bad,"In 2010 during the bad economy I found my self needing a job. Got in as a Business Customer Support Rep in Manchester NH.  After 3 months of classroom training we hit the floor and the misery begins. Hit with issues that never came up during training and answers from supervisors were ""look it up on the SharePoint"" While an angry small business customer is on the phone? Supervisors were ill trained themselves, had no answers and just were ""cops"" to watch our metrics including ""ACW"" time, that's when you take your phone out of the queue to maybe look something up on SharePoint or actually fix an issue for a customer like building a block of static IP addresses and then call them back letting them know they are all set. No.... management wanted you to fix everything with the customer still on the phone to pad their ACW stats. It was all about numbers to keep management happy not about actually maintaining a product that actually works as sold. It doesn't.  Comcast phone service does not work with dial up credit card machines that small businesses use. Gestapo like attendance policy as well. I was forced to sign a document admitting wrong for taking too much time off when I had an ill spouse and needed to care for children.  So I was lucky to find another job and the day after I gave my notice they accused me of treating a customer rudely and had me leave that day. Only when I mentioned ""attorney"" did they agree to pay me for the remainder of my two week notice. Good riddance, never again."
bad,"Worst job ever. My position was misrepresented.  Company confused about there own promotions. Ended up door knocking when my position was to be networking. This job is outdated. The fuller brush man does not exist in today's world. For the size of the company,  computers out dated. Product is good but how the company conducts business is anequated . Would you open your door to a stranger at 8 pm at night? Very poor customer  service. Very poor employee relations. This job is for very few. If you are good at cold sales and can get into someone's home at 8 pm then go for it. But less than 10 percent suuceed at this job."
bad,"I have never worked for a company that was so hated in my life. Retaining the customer (Retention Department) is a difficult job, you have to save that customer from cancelling and they expect you to sell them products. Very few customers call in for account adjustments. Most callers have been legitimately done wrong in some form or fashion and most the time Comcast policies prevent you from making it right for them. The co workers are used to people quitting quickly so don't expect to make friends. The most enjoyable part of the job are those few customers you actually can help and that feels good at the end of the day."
bad,"Comcast was a horrible company to work for when it comes to job security or being protected by your employer. You were under scrutiny for everything you did."
bad,"Working on high severity issues, sending executive updates and working with various teams and leadership to address all production issues that are customer impacting. Review steps taken to resolve incidents and ensure documentation is done for better response times for the NOC and other teams."
bad,"I worked for Comcrap for almost 4yrs. I worked with some of the best co workers you can ever imagine however the leadership from supervisors and above are the most pathetic people I have worked with or for. The senior leadership make decisions with out notice whether it be closing a call center, shift bid or even just laying off all together. I would say if you apply for any position please be prepared for not knowing if you are going to lose your job. Also dont expect promotions or advancements. Certain positions are hand picked. Also HR will tell you that most of the jobs you apply for are lateral positions. HR is a joke as well. They will hear your concern but are powerless against the evils of the leaders."
bad,"Managed 2 stores, balance safes, created schedules, payroll, hiring, firing, raises,all things hr related handled, daily paperwork and daily banking,   on call everyday"
bad,No true growth potential. The work enviroment truly sucks. Managers have their favorites and they are the only ones who are promoted. Management team has inappropiate relations with staff. The enviroment sucks. Comcast doesnt carfe about customers so csr's get cursed out often. The only plus for hourly associates is often overtime is limited and you get a set schedule
bad,Comcast wasn't a very productive company. There were a lot of illegal things going on within the company. It was a third party so Comcast wasn't notified.
bad,"A typical day @ work for me was very hectic the supervisors where never there for u in the time of need. we had tools that we had to work with and a lot of times they would not work so it would be hard to get your work done so with that they would be on you about not doing your work,they have a very unfair point system"
bad,"This company has no clue what they are doing and let me explain:"
bad,"Comcast is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. I have served the public in one way or another since I was sixteen; I'm very proficient in that department. In fact, at my prior job at Hotwire, I was the de-escalation supervisor. Comcast refuses to assist it's customers on too many levels to count, the number one complaint being, ""Comcast is a monopoly. If I could get my services elsewhere, I would."""
bad,"Process updates to orders on account orders. Contact customer for installation confirmations on orders"
bad,"Out of all the places I have worked, Comcast was the worst. It is a company that does not know how to treat it's employees or it's customers. If you simply need a job and a check, Comcast is the place, other than that, I do not recommend this company."
bad,"Systems are always crashing."
bad,"Its almost a pyramid scheme to survive this. Had to use personal vehicle to perform your job so you are using what money you may or may not have to babysit customers until your check goes through. Paid on strict commission and had to wait two weeks to receive your money. Before you head out to the field had to show up for imp rave meeting to give a review of challenges. Then drive to locations where people were not friendly to door salesmen. Sometimes you would be successful, and most the time someone on your team would arrive on your turf to steal your customer while ruining your reputation. Management would get complaints but did nothing about it. Management rather accepted the stealing behavior because of a inner circle agreement that better their lives and hurt others dramatically. Trend lead to lawsuits against management."
bad,Reselling the services to prevent customers from cancelling their services.
bad,"Micro Management, Horrible Upper Management, They treat you like a number. Absolutely NO Job Security.  Intense Pressure Everyday to sell a deal and the Market is Way over saturated.  You can't even find a Business that doesnt already have comcast and if for some reason they dont its because the Hate Comcast and will not bring it into their office no matter how much cheaper or faster it is. Seriously do not waste your time!"
bad,"Love my co-workers, a day at Comcast is very stressful the company is not a friendly employee company, not compassionate if you get sick on the job you can't leave and it you do leave you will get a UAP point."
bad,They really do not care about the customers concerns in the Sales end of the business.
bad,"When I initially joined the Comcast, I was eager to start my career and was an outstanding leader while employed for comcast.  After a while, I realized that the company was terrible and didn't want to waste my talents on such a terrible company.  "
bad,"Comcast is no longer about customer service, they are about numbers. It is Quantity over quality now. You MUST handle the call under 10 minutes, or you will be asked what is taking you so long. When you have to tell each customer the survey is about me and not how you feel about the company something is wrong  with the company. Anytime you want to change positions they want to take money from you. Working in the call center is stressful. A lot of calls are outsourced and those representatives do not know  what the hell they are saying and doing. Please get in  and get out. The Lord knows I am looking for another job."
bad,"Comcast under pays there employees, has a broken system with in. The environment if more like a sweat shop. They want you to provide superior customer service but the tools and process used are broken. For there has not been a pay increase in over 10 years and the turn over rate is very high. In fact on average a class of 20 people will be hired but by the end of training you may only have 7 people who stay If you have the opportunity to go with another company i would suggests not using this as a option if you don;t have to."
bad,"I worked at Comcast for 7 years. In my time there I saw way too much favoritism, sexual harassments, cheating, and stealing. "
bad,"Worked in an unprofessional environment where management did not care one bit about you or your work life balance. Very stressful call center where the majority of the calls received would be irate customers. Threatened several times by upset customers. Management allows customers to use profanity, vulgar language, and racial slurs. There is not structure and little room for career advancement plus they only start out paying 11.50. If you have another job offer please run from Comcast. Only accept this job if you need the experience but continue to look. They also have a very high turnover. They go on firing frenzies whenever they feel like it also. I gave them 1 star by default."
bad,"Direct Sales Sweep Residential this job has been advertised for two years, high turn-over and extremely demanding to make any income, and you use your own vehicle drive customer locations. Door to door sales."
bad,"I came to Comcast hoping to make a career move and be with the company for many years to come...Boy was I wrong! The company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced, and there is no integrity or accountability within employee practices. After only a few months with the company, I am ashamed to have worked here and would advise anyone with morals, integrity, and career goals to never work here."
bad,I worked at comact for two years. I would not recommend anyone to try and make a careeer with them. The chances for professional growth with said company are slim.
bad,"No communication, horrible management skills, do not provide a healthy environment and the time between jobs is not properly calculated."
bad,I have worked at Comcast for 7 years. This place has gone down hill. Management does not care about their employee. I have been at the same salary for 4 years and its not showing a sign of change. Our work loads are not reasonable and do not help us serve the customer. I guess depending on where you work within the company you will have a different opinion. Im speaking from the tech side. If you enjoyed not getting lunch breaks and losing money become a tech at comcast.
bad,Very bad company. Will work you to death then blame you if something is wrong. People always looking to through you under the bus to protect themselves. Instead of fixing problems always looking to blame someone
bad,"A typical day in the call center is like any other call center. You're stuck in a seat, at which you must adhere to your scheduled two 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch. Starting hourly is 10 to 11 dollars an hour. With 15 to 35 cent pay raises. However, ."
bad,They will string you along as a temp
bad,"I learned that in order to be anything within this company you must be willing to adapt to constant change. A typical day would mean waiting on more than 30 customers. I would process payments, balance out daily cash batches, perform daily bag audits, open/close the center, issue cable equipment, verify account information, and light office management. The hardest part of the job was working within a company who lost the value of family. I enjoyed my interaction with the customers. Management changed frequently and its hard to be consistant when your manangement changes so often."
bad,"Typically micromanaged by supervisors and managers who have no idea of what goes on in day to day business. Highest turnover rate I have ever seen in a group. Supervisors and managers have favorites, and if your not one, your on the short timers list."
bad,I worked at Comcast for 5yrs and it was one of the worst experiences. Your all looking over your shoulder and Sr. management never supports you.
bad,If you want to get the crumbs while you pad the pockets of the uber elite this is where to work.  Sales standard are ridiculous but no surprise from such a Horrible 1% company
bad,"Actually not a bad job, products were well priced and easily sold but management allowed an unbelievable amount of thievery to happen, locked deals were stolen by other reps all the time. People were paying other people under the table for deals and management just turned a blind eye. You couldn't leave business cards on your desk or make calls within earshot of certain reps for fear of them trying to take the deal from you."
bad,"They don’t seem to care about people as just people, more so just as a body to complete work. We are basically forced to do more work than the time we have to do it, mandated overtime even on your days off as well as expected to accomplish unrealistic expectations. It is a great company but the leadership is not good at all."
bad,"It's no wonder they shut down!"
bad,This company recently did a mass Lay off that flipped over 250 lives in one day. They only gave agents 11 days to choose to relocate their entire life to Texas or Denver. I will never trust this company again and no else should support their services
bad,"Management is bad.."
bad,"Advertises $21 per hour but pay is really $13 an hour plus commission but hard to get due to scorecard metrics."
bad,"Has one of the worst public images and customer satisfaction rates for a reason. Poor management, poor training, unrealistic expectations, no job security."
bad,Very settle form of racism. Very few AA in top position. Most AA at lower position. No European in lower position not one is in door to door sales....
bad,I cannot recommend this place to work since Comcast being a big company that it is runs their business like an early 19th century corporation. The means of getting a schedule that fits a good work/life balance is done by a shift bid and its unfair to new employees who are new at the job since you will get the worst possible shift. The pay is not great for what you put up with on a daily basis and the benefits will get you through but make sure your doctor or dentist or where you get your prescription glasses is in network. Their is opportunity for advancement if you kiss up to customers over the phone and that includes if they are just downright rude to you. The management could be better and leave their criticism at home instead of being rude to the employees. The culture is bleak and nothing you could feel happy to look forward to or the opportunity of growth. Nobody deserves this hence why I cannot recommend and would pass if I knew this earlier.
bad,"Despite annual upper management changes that causes major problems within teams under exiting mangers and clueless approach with incoming management. This generally leads to numerous unexplained terminations and unlawful work policies practiced. Because of the size of Comcast, they have funds set aside to settle with the anticipated ligation of employee rights and OSHA violations. And don’t get caught even mentioning the idea of unionizing or your termination will come down the moment the sentence is finish. Because of the despicable reputation Comcast has among the public because of the dishonest billing practices and deceitful plans that Comcast is already suffering from multiple lawsuits in the state of Oregon of their unlawful practices. The proverbial ish rolls down hill certainly applies as a employee for this company because every company needs a fall guy and generally it is the employees with no voice. As an employee despite how well you follow the employee handbook and ask for guidance from their clueless HR department. That will only put you on the radar for unexplained disciplinary action and eventual termination. Comcast will certainly remind you that they are a “at Will employer”. My honest and most helpful advice I could give to anyone considering working for Comcast...don’t do it find other means of employment."
bad,"Poor management, unable to accommodate employee's with disabilities. Supervisor's have no leadership skill's and do not care about their teams. Their pricing on the services they provide is way to high, which is why customer's are so hateful towards Comcast. Terrible place to work!! Very clicky, and a lot of drama!!"
bad,"It is a dam shame! It is a dam shame! That's all I got to say.  It is a dam shame for a company as big as comcast to have a culture of backstabbing. It is a dam shame. "
bad,"They give perks because we slaved, not worked. This job pays very well I worked 12-9 and made 14.62. BUT the bosses are for themselves, PTO incentives SUCK BEWARE. This job is full of it and will drive you into depression. I don’t recommend"
bad,"The position of communication technician is very stressful, demanding and under paid. This industry is historically underpaid with high expectations. Not a good work / life balance"
bad,Unfair work environment. Concerns are not addressed in a non-biased manner. No opportunity for growth and development. Minority women in my department are not teated fairly in comparison to men of other ethnicities
bad,"We all know that HR is to protect the company and not the employees, but Comcast takes that to the extreme. I've seen employees get reprimanded and fired even when they were the victim looking for help. The only solution is to never talk to corp HR or corp security, and try to stay under the radar, otherwise you will get punished when you try to do something good."
bad,"It was a very bad work experience. Too many changes to many different processes at all times, and it a company clearly trying to have fewer humans doing jobs, and letting an IVR/matrix figure it out and deflect the customers away. As for the human jobs that are left they tend to outsource, use non-USA humans, or both. You get really a really good price on your cable bill though FWIW. Many of the bad reviews you read are from folks who were there for years and left like myself, do the math."
bad,The culture is one of smoke and mirrors yes the company takes in zero accountability for their mistakes and blames employees for them. Do not work here unless you want stress and poor managment
bad,"Although Comcast preaches about caring about its employees, they have many double standards and do not really help, they just send you to someone else and forget then forget you needed help.  Not trustworthy management, your a number and a body to use"
bad,"Comcast will take everything from you until it come to standing by its most loyal and dedicated employees. HR is a joke and is not for the people rather for the companies bottom line (Very Cutthroat). They have very high churn and always managed to lose or get rid of their best employees, hence why they have such a bad reputation with most any customer you speak with. They have the best products and for feel they can maintain with sub par employees and that really shows to their customers."
bad,"I enjoyed helping our customers the most. I was a specialist who dealt with Sales, Billing, Escalations and new Services. I did enjoy working in the call center environment."
bad,"Job security is not an option at this company, goals are set for all employees but only apply to a few.   Training at the beginning is great, however in your background you better have a sales mentality it is the only way you will make it at Comcast."
bad,"Retention used to be a great place to work. Relaxed atmosphere, very little pressure, allowed to use aux codes as needed without a lot of questions. That's all changed now; be ready to be written up and/ or fired at the drop of a hat"
bad,You will work long hours.  You will be appreciated.  You will receive training.  Management is supportive.  The best part of the job is the people and the ability to create long lasting contacts.
bad,"I got terminated because I was told I wasn't Comcast material the manager didn't give me a reason just said that and terminated me within my last week of training. If you don't meet your quota better say bye bye to your job it's highly stressful and no job security, That's how they treat armed force members too."
bad,"I was a supervisor. Literally everyone who worked there was miserable, or so they told me. This had directly to do with the Management and the culture they created and the nature of the work. It was a high level Back stabbing operation from the start. making improvements and performing well meant nothing. Ego feeding to other Managers and superiors meant everything."
bad,nothing to review .. Would like to keep my thoughts to myself.. understand its anonymous but i dont feel comfortable.. why is this even have tp be done
bad,"Typical gigantic corporation that runs and makes money in spite of itself. There is. I career path unless you live in Philadelphia (headquarters). It doesn’t really matter if you embrace their code of conduct and preform well, when it is time to reduce workforce, the people making the most are speerated. It happened to me twice while working there. I’m just not impressed with the way that company operates."
bad,"**CAL/East Bay location ONLY** Treated like a 2nd grader in the Marine Corps. Micro-managed beyond belief by management who honestly had no clue about network maintenance. It's fine as long as they hit their numbers in terms of racial or gender hires it's fine. No need to have any technical background or skills what-so-ever. A bunch of hypocritical, phony SCUMBAGS!!"
bad,"Measure everything and take the human quality out of it.  People are intimidated, stressed and overworked.  Work life balance is talked about but not encouraged.  Benefits are given but used under duress."
bad,"Formally ok, but not that good in reality (for example: yes, you have ""great"" medical insurance benefits... but you have to pay 790 usd per month for 4 people family)"
bad,"After 2 years of reporting retaliation and targeting and unfair treatment by my lead and managers, HR did nothing to help out or solve the problem in a professional and correct way! I saw all kinds of unethical Behavior that was reported about the lead writing off equipment so the numbers match the system which is fraud! But nothing was ever done about it, they swept it under the rug like it never happened. It's not a kind of place that you want to work for if you care about advancing in your career, and having a good work environment. They also have people in management That Couldn't manage to get themselves out of a wet paper bag! Hands down one of the worst companies to work for. they care about their numbers ONLY and not about the employees!!!!"
bad,The Company was very deceiving due to the fact they painted a very nice picture but didnt live up to the painting. I personally feel this job overworked us but under paid us.
bad,"Market manager was incompetent. Senior leaders always preach do what's right but reward the ones that are over driving (mind you most overachievers were ripping custoners off) don't report anything because once you do you will have a target on your back. At first I loved my job but I saw to many shady sales people, including managers get away with things, while myself and my team did everything by the book, full disclosure to customers, doing what's right etc. Oh no if you're not overdriving sales, you're nothing to Comcast. The over all l culture declined when our VP retured. He was a man of integrity. The new VP is a joke. And goodluck suing for retaliation they make you sign an arbitration agreement so you cant .  You're basically a slave to them. I hope to see the federal government stick them with some more hefty fines. They use and abuse people. Too many good employees were axed while the dirty ones are still there."
bad,Too many politics.  Many people were prone to workplace mobbing with management involved.  Work environment could get hostile and is physically/psychologically draining.
bad,Horrible management supervisors that don't know much and are lazy they are supposed to coach agents but they themselves don't know what the heck they are doing 80% of the time quick to wright people up for their lack of coaching agents
bad,"The culture is fine once you start there. However, it is very stressful with  8 hours of non stop calls from people complaining with only two 15 min breaks. This center should truly offer four 15 minute breaks due to the high stress of the job."
bad,The work culture was horrible. I would not and have not recommended work here to any one. Employees I know there are trying to find other employment. If you like to be proactive and think outside the box this is not the place for that.
bad,"I started working for them after waiting 3 moths to get the job, and 2 months later they layoff all of us. the customers hated us plus the company doesn't care about their employees."
bad,Leadership at Comcast does not care if the metrics you are measured by are false. In meetings they ask what can be done different and when you tell them about the metrics they blame it on the technicians instead of helping to resolve the underlying issues.
bad,"At the end of the day it's just not worth it.   Comcast is greedy.  You think they are gouging customers with prices, imagine how little they want to pay their sales team."
bad,customers are starting to catch on. they force employees to sell their product with out repairing services they already have.  more needs to be investigated
bad,The expectation for reps is not the same for management. Examples of this are management leaving for the day while multiple customers wait in line upset
bad,management was not fair on job assignment. reps had to do favors for their supervisors. favored sales areas were alotted to reps who partied with their supervisors. those who chose not to were given dangerously unsafe regions to sell in.
bad,They are always hiring because after a year you realize that it's a dead end. The good positions are already taken from guys that have been working there for 30+ years .
bad,Comcast is not a good place for a temp in HR.  They have a lot of long term HR perm employees that don't do any work.  Sad to say Comcast should clean house of its perm employees that use race as a fear of lawsuit
bad,"Though your job as a Retention Agent is to receive calls from upset customers wanting to either disconnect their services or to reduce their bill, the metrics in which your performance is graded by requires line of business sales and aggressive revenue retention. When we say retention, it's not to retain you as a customer, it's to retain as much as your bill as we can. Retention Agents now required to sell cell phones. If sales is your thing, seek the retention department at Comcast."
bad,"Typical Day: "
bad,"Sadly, the senior leadership doesn't have a good understanding of the importance of logistics structure.  Good Ol' Boys club rules apply, sadly.  Installers and engineers have a pretty good life in the company.  Would absolutely recommend working for them in that capacity.  Logistics is unfortunately neglected.  Senior leadership does not support Veterans in any way.  Veteran culture is frowned upon.  NOT a Vet friendly workplace, in any way.  Other areas other than the Knoxville/Johnson City/Norton regions may be different."
bad,i have nothing good to say about this place.  they are deceitful and liars.  they promise you everything and you get nothing in return.  do not work here ever!
bad,"For what they have you do, the pay is no where near what it should be. I had no problems with the boss or other employees.  The upper management was very rude in my opinion."
bad,working in a call center is rough but working for a company like Comcast is awful. there managers were very awful. they mistreated a number of people. they also showed favoritism to certain  in the call center. the place was very stressful it also caused  to go in to a deep depression
bad,"Employees are very unhappy at the Tinley Park location. The metrics are unreal and the turnover is horrible, no job security. Management lacks professionalism  and work load is excessive. Employees are not valued here,"
bad,Very High stress and over demanding atmosphere.  Not placed in an environment to succeed.  Management didn't always support you when the need arose because of the high stress and demand on them as well.
bad,"I have worked in a LOT of call centers.  This is BY FAR the worst.  From middle management to the play land atmosphere on the call floor."
bad,"In order to advance at this company, you have to mislead the customers. Also management share this philosophy. If you feel like you can lie to your customer to get a sale, this is the company for you."
bad,"management always providing us with incorrect information to give customers , management very uptight constantly I'm you on your instant message, listen to your calls on speaker for everyone to hear, no assistance with calls customers often just hung up, waited until the day of to give a day off."
bad,"Typical day at Comcast is working on your own, mostly every single day. Different working environments, meeting customer face to face, and making difficult decisions is an everyday task. The hardest part of the job is when Mother Nature intervenes.  Weather related conditions can cause the job to become difficult, anything from high winds, cold temperatures, snow, and rain. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday and interacting. From time to time you're able to work with your coworkers side by side which makes things a lot easier. In this job you learn how to manage your time and be productive. When difficult situations arise with experience you learn to deal with difficult customers. Throughout my 10 years I had many different encounters that make the work environment difficult but I've learned how to deal with difficult irate customers. You also learn a lot about running cable from coax to cat 5. How to install different products from cable boxes, to amplifiers, modems, ect. You also have a chance to learn how to integrate Comcast systems with third party systems"
bad,"Avoid working for this company."
bad,"fun environment, great working experience high call volume"
bad,"The management was very poor and often didn't take ownership of work or short comings. Often abused their positions of power. Showed favortism often. Didn't respond to customers complaints in a timely manner. Supervisor often avoided speaking to customers by pretending to be busy or in meetings, bathrooms or on breaks. Could hardly ever get a straight resolution from supervisors or upper management. Just pressured to increase sales or upsell customers. Would time reps. on bathroom breaks and deny them breaks to use the facilities."
bad,"inbound calls up to 60+ per day"
bad,"Comcast is the worst Company to work for. Yes the benfits are good but that's it. They used me and made me feel like I would advance in the company but it never happen. The customers have the right to feel the way they feel. Comcast is getting over on all of us!"
bad,"As a billing rep, I would handle between 45 and 75 phone calls a day with angry customers with a 30 minute lunch and 2-15 minute breaks, it was not enough to make me want to stay. I learned that if you want to do something, you just have to do it. The managers are nice and they pretend to listen to you and your concerns, but nothing changes. Most of my co-workers were great and many of them are now gone also. The hardest part of the job, was being called names and not being able to hang up on the customer. The best was Comcast Cares Day."
bad,Nothing to say good about this position except cheap cable.
bad,I am not satisfied with my employment at Comcast. It is a poorly managed call center and is extremely stressful
bad,"I did business to business sales for Comcast.  The product is great but the process of getting it  installed was horrible.  Many companies got frustated and canceled."
bad,"Working at Comcast the pay was Great for the first year.You had unlimited potential of the amount your earned and the satisfaction of helping saving customers, Including the opportunity to up selling Comcast service. After the First year a Cap was placed on the commission payout and normal training was cut due to service issues. The hardest part of the job was taking on issue that did not concern your department, resulting in angry customers that i have been transferred through the service center for assistance. Management is no longer involved/required to assist agent better themselves and/or the brand of the company. Management are now concerned with offsite issues:Ex Who Your dating, Where you vacation and the trending topic of the Call Center. The Company Comcast is Great from service stand point. Im more then sure all Call centers are not in this shape but the Jackson, MS center is not a place for GROWTH or an Healthy Work environment."
bad,"Enjoyed calls from customers, till Comcast came along and took away our ""power to resolve all calls on our own."" Comcast put major restrictions on what we could and could not do. Prior to Comcast, we could take all orders/requests a customer wanted. Anything from installs, connects, transfers, upgrade/downgrades, disconnects, billing problems, and services calls. Insight knew enough to know that customers do not want to explain over and over again the reason for the call. We didn't have to transfer our customers to one CAE to another. It was a one stop shop call. It was very frustrating to not be able to help customers anymore, because they took away our ability to do so.   "
bad,"The company hires and advances based on who you know, not work ethic or skills."
bad,I've been there five years and it's gone from bad to worse. From unscrupulous business practices to mistreatment of its employees. I often feel afraid to step foot in the call center. The stress is unbelievable. Between the customers and the management. The place is almost painful to work at for a CAE.
bad,It's the co-workers that make the day go by. This company has the mentality that any person can be replaced.
bad,"Comcast changed a Customer Service position into hard-core sales, with the supervisor coming by our windows several times per day to see where how our sales were. Sales goals were increased monthly. The pay is almost minimum wagem with the promise of great commissions."
bad,"Comcast is a antiquated deceptive cauldron where nothing has any logic. Even when you achieve EVERY accolade such as tenure, experience, multiple consecutive President's Club Award(s), and repeated YoY growth favoritism still triumphs over meritocracy. The stress from lack of work life balance sent me to the hospital 4 times, and made me put on 60lbs of extra weight. I am considered the best in the country at what I do, therefore I think I have earned the right to state the facts as a top employee working for the organization. My sales results have been up 38% YoY and my at risk compensation is down 58% YoY making a 92% spread in pay. How would you like to perform more, and be paid 0.08 on the dollar compared to last year? Tragedy."
bad,I have nothing to say I worked there for 11 yrs was fired for bs this company does not care about your wellbeing all they care about is corporate work
bad,"The job was amazing at first then A lot changed. First A complete change in management paralyzed the store. Incompetent people who have No experience leading people. We got to the point where we told cx we work independently because management would not come out and engage irate cx, issue credits, nothing. Secondly the pay changed Tremendously! My first year I made 55,000 my second year was close to 30,000. The commission structure changed as cx were getting rid of cable and we were forced to adapt while managements perks got better. One day it will be better but for now no."
bad,"The company is great to work for offers a lot, but the management team at this site is the worst.if your not kissing up to them, or bowing down to them your not going to progress with the company, if they feel like your going to be a problem they fire you before you become an issue."
bad,"Supervisor and mangers had favorites and if you where not one of them, no matter how hard or good you work you didn’t get treated fairly. Hard working senior guys were easy replaceable to Comcast."
bad,Comcast benefits are great and that is the only reason I've been there for 5 years. It is extremely stressful work place and you are pressured to do things that will not always benefit the customer.
bad,"This company picks favorites and the leaders scratch each other's backs. If the employee is toxic, but knows someone, they won't get fired. Leaves feelings of hopelessness. The leaders do not know how to communicate, respect, or help their employees. I've seen corruption at the highest level."
bad,If applying for this company do not allow yourself to get caught up in Comcast politics because as soon as you attempt assist with bettering the customer experience and aligning policy and guidelines the upper management will remove you due to going not going with norm behavior on site
bad,"The company is eliminating/consolidating jobs all over the place so if you are a front line employee or even middle management I would consider your self in a temporary employee. The ""try"" to find you another role but I wouldn't count on that. I was in a ""interview"" with three managers and all of them spent more time checking their smart watches then listening to me, so the interview felt over before it started. The plus side is you get a great discount and descent PTO, until your role is eliminated that is."
bad,It was the worse place I ever worked.  Not supported by management and HR was a joke. Their Comcast Listens Portal is a tool that can be manipulated to ruin careers
bad,"Comcast, is HR ran and they do not back their employees whatsoever. They constantly look for ways to get rid of employees and to hire new ones.  It is probably the most messed up company that I have ever worked for! Sales increased every year, and apparently Denver are division office didn't like our general manager, they let him go for nothing and they did the same with me. Very sad company to work with and for"
bad,"The worst part about this job is that there is so much to know and they expect you to know it in a little over 1 month!! Once you get out on the call center floor and start taking calls, its on you! Floor support is not that great either. Management thinks its funny to put some idiot on floor support to force you to think for yourself instead of someone knowledgeable and who can point you in the right direction."
bad,Horrible Management and Unrealistic Goals to meet. Pay was good but in order to get the most out of the job and to be even a little motivated to go back you had to make lots of commission.
bad,There is nothing personable about working for this company you are a number and you are rated with your performance by the numbers you provide. If you are late write up and it's stressful 😔
bad,management is clueless and HR only protects bad employees.  they expect you to work all weekends while giving you weekdays off.  They expect to to come in on your days off and if you don't you are penalized on your yearly review for not coming in.
bad,Lots of unethical practices. Worst place to work. Don’t care about tenure agents. Hiring low class trashy people. It’s a waste of a company. Benefits are great.
bad,The Tinley Park location was poorly ran Management was the worst. Treated unfairly and very unprofessional. supv were the worst as well non motivating.
bad,If you were not black or Spanish you eventually were let go there was no mentorship unless you were in a clique it was a horrible experience sorry that I ever tried to advance in the company
bad,"There is very little to no Supervisory assistance. When you do ask a Supervisor for assistance, you either get yelled at like he is still in the military or told you will get fired for asking him for assistance. You are not equipped with the tools you need to complete jobs in an efficient manner and the timelines provide to complete some jobs are unrealistic. You are provided with a tool to report any internal matters to be kept anonymous and when this tool is used, staff are reprimanded in staff meetings for having used this tool as Double A feels that it is something that could have been addressed with him when all he does is threaten your job all while yelling at you. There needs to be better management in place that staff can feel they are able to approach. The very evident thing in place is a closed door policy and to rely solely on your colleagues in the same role as you. For such a reputable company, more needs to be done for staff to feel valued and respected."
bad,"Worked there for over 36months and the first year was great however, WOrking for XFINITY MOBILE is just as bad as the customer service they give to customers due to non working systems and no guidance on how to fix complex customer issues. Management is focused more on customer service rather than the culture inside the department. Oh and don’t be African American trying to advance."
bad,Very Stressful work environment very little support from management. Changes made that does not help it hurts the business. Emotional abuse from customers
bad,There is no room for advancement unless you relocate. The manager and supervisor is not fair. They have favorites and if you are not friends with them you are basically screwed. You get lied to so you have to make sure everything is in writing. You take the classes and pass them for raises then they always come up with some kind of excuse not to give you the raise .
bad,comcast sucks. i was discriminated against because of my disability. i reached out for help and none was provided. i should have sued them and will regret that i didnt until i die
bad,"If you are not in the click you will never get anywhere in this company."
bad,Being apart of the HR department we like to say all the great points when on boarding new hires candidates. This has felt like a lie knowing that the company focuses more on bringing in new talent (that are easily disposable) rather than focusing on developing the talent they have internally to promote from within. There was very little feedback from internal interviews for different positions on what to work on to get you into that role and hire “friends” onto the teams regardless of experience.
bad,I delivered record breaking sales and was the recipient of their highest award.  I was not liked by the team and management who made my experience miserable
bad,"This company treats it's employees like cogs in the machine. All they care about is metrics. You can't even go to the bathroom  or have a medical emergency without getting in trouble for ""spending time off the phones"". My supervisor was horrible and wouldn't acknowledge ways to improve work if it didn't involving shoving down products down a customer's throats. "
bad,Forced to do things daily that were not fair or ethical...forced to upsell people who could not afford cable and services in the first place.  employees were treated as bad as the customers...
bad,Even thou this company paid compensation it was not worth all the stress and hatd work. No room for advance always hiring outside . Not treated fairly
bad,"If you need a paycheck thats understandable. But if you have an education please seek elsewhere. This company will drain the life out of you. Stress you out over every little thing even when you do the right thing you are still in the wrong. The only thing Comcast cares about is money coming in, its a business understandable but they truly treat their employees poorly! Annual raises are on a system that is counted against you even if you are the best technician in the office or even the state. You wont even get a dollar raise here annually. thirty to fifty cent max on yearly raises. If you are about your family look elsewhere, this place will ruin your beloved time at home due to stress and not being able to leave the work at work. Please seek employment elsewhere"
bad,Comcast does not treat it's employees with respect.  It's Human resources department does not address issues brought to their attention.  They brush really serious offences of the management team under the rug.
bad,A typical consists of 6 jobs and performing installs of Comcast products or trouble shooting problems.  Meeting those jobs in time frames and having a clean drivers license.Consitent training on products and updates.
bad,I was one of the top people for 2 1/2 years. Made one minor mistake (that was easy to fix) and they fired me on the spot. Comcast went from great to the local sewage.
bad,"Poor leadership and disappointing lack of workplace culture from the top down. Management does not properly respect or recognize employees for their hard, productive work. Very disappointing for a company of this size and influence in the community."
bad,"Comcast had the worst leadership I have ever worked for."
bad,"Very hard to get  promoted when there's favoritism present, start at 730am get off at  900pm many times very long hours not able to spent time with family, seniority doesn't count when working there"
bad,"You think customers have it bad try being an employee you get managed by inept people that get hired from outside the company and they have no idea how to run anything. They don’t promote from within at all. Even if you did you would make even less as a supervisor so there is no point. Even if you do manage to get on a sales team that has someone supervising with half a brain you will get your sales stolen from you by other sales divisions. So when your customer calls in you got a 50/50 shot that the sales rep in inbound won’t steal your sale. Then you got the guys on the outside or b2b reps that routinely steal your sales. Some are so bad they will destroy a sale rather than give it to you just so you take a hint and sell elsewhere. Management knows this and they ignore the rules of engagement. They even have a name for it called DUPING. It’s stealing by duplicating the efforts of others for your own personal gain. Then you have people that pull lists of customers that call or go online to inquire about Comcast services and those leads are supposed to get spread out amongst sales reps but instead are stolen by running reports in sales force and locking down those leads before anyone can get to them. "
bad,Comcast is a it's not what you know it who you know run company. Previous leadership experience is generally not taken into consideration when it comes to career growth.
bad,Terrible management not on the same page as employees does not document correctly on employee behavior would not recommend this company to a friend or family
bad,"I took the position with the impression that I would make a living wage.  Although I worked very hard, I made very little money.  I quit after 14 months."
bad,"stressful, unhappy daily environment"
bad,"Here is the short version."
bad,"Comast was one of the worst companies i have ever worked for, there was no work life balance, the employees all talksd about eachother the management was terrible i hated it"
bad,"Very demanding work enviorment. If you are struggling on something don't bother to ask management or they will look at you crazy, and that's even when you get out of training on to the floor. They are also very quick to terminate or write you up over small stuff. The only pro is the benefits and the extremly low discount you get for comcast services."
bad,"I worked there five years & it was the worst job ever!!! The customers are allowed to talk to you any kind of way & you have to accept it. They claim to be a family friendly business, but it’s all a bunch of bs. They could careless about what emergencies may occur... I’ve seen employees leave in an ambulance & still receives a uap (point) for leaving or missing work! They gave me a promotion for two years & turned around and took it back, not for lack of performance or anything. Just relocated the department and expected my department to return back to billing. Leadership is a joke.. if you’re not kissing their butts, they have no use for you. The benefits & pay was the only thing that kept me there so long."
bad,"Part time employees were only allowed 28 hours per week. However, full timers got overtime as much as they would take. Pay scale could not be adjusted for this per management. "
bad,"Unable to pick your own schedule, management and co workers act and talk however they want, terrible environment to work in. Whole workplace feels like youre back in high school."
bad,"A typical day is back to back calls no breath in between. Constant unhappy customers and leadership. Relaxed casual dress code does not comfort you enough and the high pay will only keep your sanity so long. I wouldnt recomend this enviroment to anyone unless you are cool with constant verbal abuse from leadership & customers. Constantly they change processes with out notifying representatives and set impossible goals so that reps are fudging and omitting processes causing poor customer experiance. Comcast gives broken, half working or not working tools and processes to front line reps and make it impossible for anyone to help and assisst. Every day is full of false promises, overly complicated processes and lots of sweeping under the rug."
bad,"I worked in Digital Care and it was the worst job I've ever had. The management had no idea what was going on ever. The manager was worthless, as were the Supervisors. They did nothing and were angry when you asked for help. My supervisor had zero idea about any of the ""policies""."
bad,"Company overall is one of the best companies ever. Benefits are very competitive, Yet If you work out of the Hialeah office, You will face a very hostile and cut throat environment. You cannot trust anyone in management. "
bad,"This company is huge, however, to advance in this company you will need to know the hiring person and be friendly. They don't look at their system of scorecard when making a decision as well they don't look at your education."
bad,"Comcast was a miserable place to work.  Always high pressure for more sales, better customer reviews.  Goals set by management were unrealistic.  If you happen to meet the goal then it was raised and you were again pressured and made to feel incompetent."
bad,"This management and the people sucked. I hated going to work everyday, I literally contemplated how much I needed this job before going, period I HATED THIS JOB."
bad,I was treated different because I did not speak Spanish and I was going through a very difficult time in my personal life that I could not help. I was trained by someone who intentionally had me do things the incorrect way.
bad,"While advancement was available, the corporate culture at Comcast was not one of customer satisfaction. Customer service reps were held to sales quotas. Billing systems were antiquated and had many bugs/errors. The biggest challenge was to keep existing customers happy."
bad,If you want to feel secure in your job and do not expect the rules to change very often i do not suggest you work at comcast. They write you up or change the way things work based upon when and how they feel. i put many years into the company to just be basically forced out because they make it so stressful
bad,not room for advancement. Company does not keep there word. Company does not follow up on advancement opportunities like they say their going to do in the beginning
bad,The stress there is nonstop. Management complains about metrics to employees on a daily basis. And the customers primary complaint is price. Also  the calls never stop.
bad,management only looks out for themselves. no one cares about employees or customers. HR are backstabbers. Rats and will make up reasons to get someone fired. needs to be reported to better business bureau
bad,It was an awful experience.  Sales reps are constantly micromanaged and not trusted. The product was awful and the customer service was even worse. I would not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,"I have worked for Comcast 9.5 years as a CARE - Customer Service representative.  There is a culture difference between how the CARE organization is looked upon compared to other departments in the company.  For example: The way the metrics are designed set up an adversarial relationship between team leads and the agents.  If an agent misses one metric out of 5 for two months in a row they are automatically on verbal warning.  There is an increasing pressure to sell additional products, even to those who have been a customer for less than 60 days."
bad,Good benefits. Horrible location. Work life balance not there. Hard to get assistance when needed. Poor communication with floor on updates. Want customers off phone to quickly to resolve issues
bad,Management was not well organized and if you were not in there click you were on the outs. They promoted people that had less potential rather than someone who had great potential.  They make the job very stressful the only thing they thought about was numbers.
bad,Very stressful and they never keep departments secure. They treat you very unfair if FMLA is used. They are not a good company to work for. Unless you never want to move up.
bad,"There was always a higher call volume than there was agents which reflected in the customer service experience poorly. Management placed high quotas and metrics on employees last minute and hired new agents who were under trained and confused.  The lack of communication , training and poor management in this department created high call volumes,  stress and lack of motivation among the call center.  Very cut throat environment,  not a fun or relaxed place to work . Everyday of work felt like the life was being pulled out of you. Very suffocating  environment  and lack of supervisional support."
bad,The mangers are not leaders they are simply puppets . They don't inspire you  or want to get their hands dirty.  They are simply there to collect a paycheck. Company could be  $80 billion company if they had actual leaders and not a bunch of politicians who don't want to address real issues.
bad,"I worked in a billing call center. "
bad,"employees not appreciated, no job security. management is very unfair and all for self. don't ever get too comfortable with anything because things change everyday, no warning."
bad,Environment at kiosk inside brandsmart stores are very stressful and  unbearable schedule where theres no time for family. Comcast kiosk inside of brandsmart follow the same schedule.
bad,"The Billing Department is the worst department in Comcast. The do not tell you until your almost out of training that you have to sell products as part of your Matrix. You take the job thinking that all you'll be doing is explaining the customers bills but that's far from it. You have to sell sell sell and sell some more because it plays a big part in you excelling to the next level and if you don't your not moving up nowhere. In training you will notice that you don't read the bill until your last week of training and it can be a very difficult thing to read because it doesn't make sense. Worst of all is the customers, you will get tons of customers who will call up to complain and chew you out because the bill is too high or they simply don't pay their bill and wonder why it's high. Now some customers are nice and understanding and there are somethings you can help them out on but others already have big promotions and pretty much want to pay next to nothing but have all the services. It will definitely be the longest 8 hours of your like guaranteed. I could put lots more but I'll say out of 12-13 people that was in my training class only 4 people is still there. That should say something."
bad,Great and exciting place to work for.  Great temporary job for those who are seeking introduction to telecommunications and customer service skills.  verry fun
bad,I would not recommend if you have young children very stressful job. Do not care how you feel about changes. Commission changes every year . To move up it all about who are you close too. Lost of great giveaways but once again very stressful job not so much customer more on internal side constantly threatening you about losing your job. I feel that things are set up to get rid of old workers to bring in new hire
bad,Comcast for the most part is an okay company to work for if you are in high school or looking for extra money while furthering your education. Other than that I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants to get compensated for their handwork. They expect you to learn multiple skill sets but for the same pay which makes no sense.
bad,They use you until you no longer can take being used. I was blocked from advancement because i had a college degree but my management did not.  Would never work there again.
bad,"They ask you, as a retention agent, to save the cancelation calls you receive. But they don't actually do anything to fix the issues, tech being late, tech never showing up, inferior equipment, etc. "
bad,"working in the Comcast call center is a stressful experience. when 80% of the staff is not making there numbers this to me seems to be a problem. management for the most part is non-existent.Not wanting to help the rep when needed, and not all management is fully trained to do the job that the technician is trained for. Reps are expected to de-escalate any call issues that require a manager which becomes difficult since they do not have the ability or authority to do certain things.   The job is has a training program that is laughable at best. People who have no technical experience are ""Trained"" as billing, internet, and phone technicians and still have no idea what they are doing. I have a technical background and still had a hard time adapting. simply because their training program is so outdated that most of the information no longer applies to the programs being used. the technology is being updated all of the time but the representatives are not. when a customer calls in the rep is expected to verify the customers information, make sure they are allowed access to the account and fix any and all of the customers issues within an 11 minute window. this is not feasible in most technical related calls. Especially when it comes to phone troubleshooting where re-building and entire system of phone lines on the fly is the only way to fix the problem. working for Comcast was not a pleasant experience"
bad,"Benefits are pretty good,Discounted Cable Service, Fast paced Industry 10 hr days go by pretty fast because you are always busy.Meeting new people everyday"
bad,Intergetic person it is a terrible unstable company. Company rules constantly changing due to losing profits on a constant basis. Not a friendly environment.  COMPANY always changing stats due to profit lose company do not give worker all changes at the same time. Every agent gives a different answer at the same time
bad,"The perks are great: Discounted services, commission, incentives, etc. "
bad,"I was a great full time employee working in the customer service call center in Colorado for all of 2016. When it was time for my husband and I to PCS to Georgia, I transferred to the local store. Management is never there, The employees are very mean towards sales and a lot of unethical things were happening which led me to resign. I don't recommend working here in Hinesville, Georgia."
bad,The changes and lack of follow through made this job a nightmare.  There is zero work life balance.  The company has began to exploit employees and consistently  the pay.
bad,"A typical day is walking down the street in the hot sun going door to door trying to sell a package. I learned that jobs like that aren't always safe.Management was very friendly and professional. My co-worker was a former co-worker from previous jobs, so she was like my work buddy. The hardest part was being in the sun for 6-8 hours a day. The most enjoyable part was making a few new friends."
bad,The companies managers do not care for their employees. The service techs are basically the police of Comcast and have to fix everything. Tech support is hit or miss.  It is pass the buck leadership. No one wants to claim responsibility.
bad,Come into work at 8am log into the phone with my personal ID #. At Comcast i took anywhere from 20-75 calls  a day and sometimes more. I was in to repair que for internet phones cable tv. I learned how to trouble and repair internet service a skill witch i use at home and with other family members. I most say the one part of the job i dislike was being in a que.
bad,horrendous. Management teams are just as bad as their customer service. only pro is the benefits that this company has to offer
bad,Company was very stressfull and very time consuming and management did not care about the employees. There was never any management to answer calls that I could not handle.
bad,"Great pay but be prepared to be micromanaged.  Also, be prepared to work in a steady paced large call center.  Also, have patience with management, they are high strung and ambitions.  It is important to have a winning attitude for success."
bad,would not work there again. no way to move up. work life balance is really bad. way under paid for the amount of work you do.
bad,Full eight hour shift in telecommunications. This position builds your work experience level. The team worked well together. Each team member holds up and helps the next one.
bad,"I took this position due to the fact that I would get promoted if I exceeded my sale quota every month. This particular position is mainly for college and high school student. Most of the agents that work here barely graduated high school, and most people that work in this department will not get promoted to a better position. The telemarketing position is not entry level. As long as you have a voice box they will hired you. The hardest part of the job is the customer saying no and management says don't take it serious. How can you not take it serious when you have to pay your bills? The most enjoyable part of the job is the work and life balance."
bad,"Comcast seemed like a great option. Decent pay, Great benefits and hours. You will never get use to be screamed at on the phone by random upset customers. No matter how much you apologize the customers will tear into you, i've been called every name there is when i was only trying to do my job. If that isn't bad enough, a couple months into the job i get a email stating that a mandatory shift change would occur."
bad,"Management the rules do not apply."
bad,"Comcast call centers are not for customer support, they are intended to increase comcast revenue."
bad,"Comcast, is a great career, but I did't enjoy it at all. There was a lot of office politics, when it wasn't work related.  There was no security at all. We had been threaten before nothing was ever done. They say Comcast Listens , but truly they don't. The only thing that I can be thankful for is that I had got experience from the company. I learned a lot. And I would definitely be happier with another company since I have more knowledge and experience from Comcast."
bad,I had a friend who worked in Sales. Scranton - very saturated. NO Verizon FIOs here so businesses don't have a choice than to purchase Comcast. HIGH TURNOVER and currently sales people are not making their monthly goals. They also have an over hire constantly on board knowing that someone on the team will fall out. Management doesn't have a say in anything.
bad,I worked at Comcast for almost  2 years. I got fired on  a medical leave. They show favoritism. Some Supervisors do drugs! Management also was known for taking money from Comcast! They fire people for no reason. Supervisors is very messy! I would not recommend anyone to work there.Very unprofessional. The company don't care about their agents!! They only care about numbers!
bad,"They are a poorly ran company who could care less about their employees and their employees disabilities. They never accommodated me for my disability, even after corporate hr approved them 2 months after the submitted request, the Fishers Comcast never gave me the accommodations and they expired. Also the company Sedgwick, which is who they work with when employees need to take a leave of absence, is the worst company to work with while you are struggle with you absence issues. They claim to never get paperwork or they claim there isn't enough detail which causes stress to the employee and the doctor treating them."
bad,"Comcast's culture is the sickest, most toxic one I've ever been a part of, and I couldn't get out quick enough. In short, it is Dilbert. They value numbers only, not quality of service (despite current initiatives) or certainly not their employees. Hardly anyone likes working there, but they continue to do so either because they're not qualified or too scared in this economy. Constant micro-managing IS the norm, across the board. Doesn't matter if you're a ""suit"" or a tech--you better be prepared to be constantly harassed, lied to and mistreated by your own company."
bad,"typical day at work is always hectic. systems is always going down, calls are back to back, management dodge calls requested by customer. Hardest part of the job is trying to do your job when the system you  need does not work. most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers who keep the day going by fast."
bad,On average I would walk miles a day door to door offering up Comcast products and services with sometimes little to no sales. Management was very poor and you never knew what to expect from them. Co-workers were nice and the pay was decent and those were about the only good things about the job.
bad,"Never actually worked for the company.   They were doing a mass hiring in all locations , i was interviewed and recommended for a location and came that close to signing papers with the hr dept, and found out that a local facility 5 miles away from my house was  available doing the same job. Going to this comcast facility would  have saved me approx 400 dollar in gas amd tolls. I was offered to interview at the closer facility but was denied the position that i was accepted for in woodridge. .answered all questions.   Exactly the same but Michael the interviewer said he would have to talk to the 2 recuriters i spoke to ,refered to.them bu name and then and then denied me ,he did keep reference to my my age never asking it but he did prefer younger employees. I yold the recuriter about this and they said she would call me back soon ...  never got a call.  Very bad organization leaving me with terrible feeling of Comcast"
bad,"As a Direct Sales Representative my typical work day included knocking doors and following up with leads Tuesday-Saturday from 11am-8pm. From day one we had A LOT of turn over. Mainly do to Comcast unfair commission structure. They want you to get a triple play each day while also walking door to door 8 hours a day which is very difficult. On top of that when you don't hit ALL of your quotes the pay drop...A LOT. Example ""30% or less of quote means you get NO commission for that pay period"" or ""75% of your quote means about 55% of your commission."" It's just one of their many many tactics to may the Reps less. They also advertise you'll make $75,000-$100,000 a year but the truth is the average Rep makes about $45,000 a year. I know the other positions in the company are treated better but if you are thinking about ANY position in sales in Comcast PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look else where. Their only concern is the bottom dollar and they will do whatever it takes to get the best profit."
bad,You cannot have a family or personal life working for Comcast.  I worked every single Saturday from 11-8 and during the week 12-9 off days were Tuesday and Sunday.  I missed alot of family time with my children.
bad,"A typical day I would greet each customer at the front desk, assist with any issues, take new orders and also upsale each customer. The hardest part of my job the sale quota each month change and were ridiculous. I thought my co workers and I was like a family but each person only concern about themselves. I enjoyed being the top salesperson almost each month. The manager do not knows how to manager her office, forget what she tells you and change the policy when he/she wants."
bad,This company hires with false pretense. Horrible environment let alone ignorant customers. This is a Job for special people who enjoy talking to foul mouthed individuals each day and occasionally taking a sales call
bad,"Worked for Comcast as a technical support representative, first as internet, then as a VOIP support representative for CDV, (Comcast Digital Voice). Stayed with the company for the pay and benefits, management were perpetual liars and would take credit for large projects that workers did all the hard work for. Favoritism and nepotism were rampant throughout the company. Our entire divisions jobs were shipped to the Philippines due to employee cost. This is a terrible company to work for, greedy and dishonest."
bad,"I was working in an hostile work environment. It wasn't my co-workers, it was the managers that ran the place. There was more work than employees. We barely had our lunches and breaks and had to work overtime ever day for the pass two months prior before leaving the company. We had lost 4 employees and the managers didn't want to hire anyone. There was no support from the Warehouse HUB in Tracy, Ca. and the managers when we ran out of equipment for the techs and the payment centers. Overall the benefits where great and I know it wasn't the Company it self. I was the area that I worked at."
bad,"Position involved assisting customers with willing concerns, trouble-shooting services, and proactively selling other  products (Video, Internet, Phone, Home Security)"
bad,"helping customer with their cable bills, and also  offering them other promotions."
bad,"Business Class Outbound Sales is new. Run by inbound & residential sales management, constantly changing sales metrics and rules sometimes multiple times in a week. Contention between inbound, outbound, and field reps out of control. Unstable work conditions the management is inexperienced and metrics are twisted."
bad,"It is a good company to work for, but it is still plagues with its issues"
bad,"Comcast business class was like working at a beef slaughter house.They heard people in like cattle. They have training classes every 30 days with about 20 to 30 people. The place only sits up to 500 people. They say oh we promote people quickly, they lie. You either quit or get canned for not meeting metrics. The metrics make you feel like you are a robot and Micro managing is rampid. The upper management look at and treat the agents like cock roaches.The pay is way beneath what other telecom companies offer for tech support. Up to 5.00 per hour lower. Walked by a supervisor who said ""I love the face on people when they get fired"" They say that they express professionalism, and good benefits. Well needless to say there is no professionalism, and the benefits are good, because you are sick alot from the poor maintainance on the building, and stress they put on your body and mind. I was offered a better job and I would not recommend anyone to work for this company or sign up for their services. They promise customers 4 hour turn around times, which most of the time were not met. They cancel appointments with out customers being notified, and they promise better speeds and better services for business customers. Not true it is exactly the same as residential only they charge more for the service. We had to lie to business class customers all day. Would not recomend anyone to work for this business or get services from them."
bad,Comcast demands a lot from their workers and they in turn received no support from their job. It is stressful because the managers and supervisors are very caddy.
bad,"Company does not value family. There is no work-life balance. Does not value hard work, instead judge based on favoritism. Poor upper management from the VP all the way down. HR allows unfair work practices and does not uphold the law. Poor salaries, really have a slave mentality with the good ole boy system. Very stressful place to work, the worst employer have had in my work his."
bad,Departments within Comcast that rely on each other work against each other versus working together to accomplish a goal. The leadership is lacking with people skills. They try to intimidate first level managers in an attempt to achieve positive results. The pay is not comparable to similar jobs with the same scope of responsibilities.
bad,"working for Comcast i learned to be more self sufficient. i am reliable and i have excelled and De-escalating issues that a typical agent may incur.my co-workers are team players, however, management doesn't seem to be on board.the most enjoyable part of my job is my day off."
bad,Answering inbound sales calls. Great people worked in management and co-workers worked as a team. Constant pressure the company put on their employees was a day to day problem. Sign off at the end of the day was what employees looked forward to.
bad,"Employees are treated terrible, like most major corporations. Everything is a chore there, and it should be rename to ""pass the buck"" since no one wants to take any accountability. Inter-department fighting is daily and every blames everyone else for all the many, many problems. Plus the customers are terrible to deal with."
bad,"Let me start out by saying that there are a lot of good people that work here. The benefits are really good when compared to other places I have worked. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends. The management, starting with front line managers and going up to the Area VP are just about as incompetent a group of people as I have ever worked with."
bad,"Treat you like trash, no advancement out of the telesales department"
bad,"Nothing worth while working here, customer service was still a mess and 95% of the time management does not correct issues. A waste of time, and career decisions in my part."
bad,"Work life balance is poor. 1/2 of my training class was given the option to pick their schedule and the rest got stuck with one timeframe, which isn’t fair. An act of Congress is needed to change your schedule. You have to be a level 2 before you’re eligible to bid on schedules. They bid once a quarter, so if your review date happens after the bid, you’re stuck with a schedule that doesn’t work for you for another 3 months, given that you meet their ridiculous expectations to make it to level 2. Oh, your first review isn’t until you’ve been there for 6 months. So at max, you’re stuck with a terrible schedule for 9+ months. The most ridiculous requirement is that you must sale every month. Depending on the amount of calls you take, that number varies. It also varies based on what level you are. Support roles shouldn’t have to sale lines or business. Customers call in frustrated and want help with a technical issue, not be pitched to. Or they call in to lower their bill, not have us talk them into forking over more money for “upgrades” they don’t want, need, or ever use. It’s pointless, but money hungry corporate overlords don’t care."
bad,Unfortunately it’s all about who you know and the location you work in. The company thrives on Drama and won’t change. They expect you to work a minimum of 12 hours a day on Salary.
bad,"Management cuts every corner.   No competition leads to this monopoly not caring about products working well.   They boast about cutting edge technology,  until it fails in the customer homes.   When you try to make a difference,  you are reminded it doesn't help the stakeholders.   However,  most women are promoted too often.   They also care about veterans."
bad,Not fair in movement to new positions to better one self. Not fair when evaluating one’s performance. Not fair in testing to learn new things. Moral is very low
bad,First years were great.  Then restructuring over and over to the point everyone is silo and no one know what the other department is doing.  They have completely lost sight of employee and the stress levels are at all time highs.  Disappointing.
bad,"Arrived to work at 10am. Live calls were taken starting around 10:15am, the job was stressful due to lack help from managers to help employees meet their monthly sales goal."
bad,Comcast has very good benefits package and a chance to progress in your career. I would recommend Comcast as a good place to work however many organizational changes happen and if your okay with changes than this is the place for you. As far as shifts goes there a wide variety of shifts and it will include you working one of your weekend days if not both. There are major shift bids that happen annually followed by mini bids throughout the year and you get ranked according to tenure and performance and that will basically give you leverage in choosing a shift.
bad,Was good until it wasn't. Management was not up to par. Was told to do something then was told that was not what they wanted. Very confusing instruction on what was expected.
bad,After 5 years of dedication and hard work I was promoted to ASM. After a few run-ins with my deliquent superior I was mysteriously fired for expressing my displeasure with his lack of commitment and effort. Not one person from this company contacted me or even questioned his decisions because he was the bosses friend outside of work. Still thinking about suing
bad,"Typical day required receiving technical support inquires from enterprise business customers via phone and email to identify one advanced product or multiple. The work place was a very social environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers where I did not have the skill set to assist customers; however, I was able to solve problems by networking with other employees to solve problems, i.g engineers, sales representatives, supervisors and directors."
bad,Working 4-10s was awesome at Comcast. Great team work and good management support. The one bad thing about the job was the metrics and how those numbers are compiled.
bad,"poor management made for poor working conditions."
bad,"Hi stress level,poor management, micromanaged to a high level. Would not recomend, high turnover rate. The staff morale is generally very low."
bad,"Very stressful workplace.  No time to recover from the stress of customers.  Had nightmares about work after working there for 2 months.  I hated the person I became because of the job.  No one there cares about your development as a person, just your shift adherence, not even how much time or effort you give, even if the time and effort is above and beyond what the job asks of you."
bad,"As a Tech Support rep, Comcast is an absolutely terrible place to work. It's even worse as a billing support rep. "
bad,"the pay here was awesome however employees are encouraged to be dishonest and do things to the customers that were not right. I could not do to someone what I did not want done to myself, my mother or anyone. but like I said they did pay very well and if you are a person that only money matters this would be a great place for you. if you are a person that cares about what your hand produces in the world you wont last too long here."
bad,"If you enjoy favoritism, getting your hours screwed then this is the place for you"
bad,For advertising sales the opportunity for new hires to make decent money isn’t good.   Unless you are hired with a good “list” your chances of making it are slim.  Maybe 15% of new AE’s make any money that aren’t hired with a good list.  Very difficult.   One of the worst media sales jobs I ever had.
bad,They will fill your seat faster then you can empty your desk. You are just a number to them and do not budge for long time employees or otherwise. Too focused on getting sales rather then how you perform otherwise as a customer service representative. They act like they care about you as an employee but when it comes down to it they don’t.
bad,"New managers dont have any communication with sups and agents. Long hours, they expect you to be there and at times no advancement at work. They just changed their closing hours recently b/c of agent complainints. Sups don’t know what to expect, sometimes they’re also new and as agents they ask you for help and later talk to you about shrinkage. New upper management lack communication, the only good thing about working at Comcast."
bad,"I had to resign myself to applying to Comcast because I was let go from an IT contract I had worked on for seven years.  I applied, got called, was told one number as compensation and didn't get it in writing, so was forced to accept much lower.  Comcast Tech training is absolutely glorious.  I enjoyed learning something knew to throw in my IT bag of tricks and my peers in my ""class"" were awesome.  Unfortunately, the training on how to hang drops and how to do fittings and connectors does not prepare one for going in to ungodly and terrible conditions people call their ""homes.""  Mystery stains, surfaces that have not seen a cleaning in years, and crystallized cat urine are a few things you will encounter.  Comcast also gives you a ""time limit"" and expects you to be able to complete insane work requests in forty-five minutes.  Your usual day will be comprised of two appointments scheduled from 8-10, two 10-12, at least one 1-3, and at least one 3-5.  You will not be given enough time to complete all of these, so you WILL be late to one and this will be held against you.  Trying to advance to higher levels is near impossible with the metrics they want you to meet, you WILL start to get frustrated and eventually stop caring about trying to get to the next job."
bad,"Could have been okay, but management (and I'm NOT trying to be mean) consists of semi-literate corporate goons.  They have the English/grammar skills of a 12 year old.    Critical thinking skills disturbingly absent.  Comcast absolutely rips off their customers the ones who figure that out are rightfully infuriated - when they call they are very upset about being lied to (re prices skyrocketing yet they are still locked into contracts) the training is a joke, management/leadership is terrifyingly dumb and incompetent.  The overall work environment feels a lot like country lock up - super obnoxious ""adults"" trapped in a teenager's mind.   There were some people I liked, but most of them were the dregs of society.   When you think of dirtbag boiler room con-artists - you are getting a good picture of the ""culture.""    They watch you with cameras and have roving guards who are sent to check on you via walkies talkies - no joke this is a PERFECT job for ex-cons/repeat offenders.   If you have to use the restroom more than once every 6 hours, YOU WILL be taken aside and reprimanded like a CONVICT or a child.   I wouldn't work this nightmarish lowlife prison complex for 80 grand a year, and you won't make 1/3 of that.   I would rather clean garbage off the highway than work for these mindless, evil, con artists.   AVOID THIS NIGHTMARE AT ALL COSTS.    There's a reason why they are ALWAYS hiring non-stop year round - they know how awful they treat their slave I mean employees, and THEY DO NOT CARE - they just abuse and replace us, like disposable batteries."
bad,"I worked with Comcast for years, and loved it. My managers were epic and helping me advance. Then I decided to turn down a sup offer to go to a different team and try social media, and it all went downhill. The leaders were nice to your face, but managed like cut-throat call center leaders who only wanted numbers, not good customer service. I was fired, and while I considered myself a lifer at Comcast, I'm not even sad - I hated my manager that much. She's a horrible manager. I liked her has a person, until I realized she's two-faced. "
bad,"The management team needs to be reevaluated for sure, the team members are awsome allways willing to help.  The managers just stand back and let the team become target practice for the knifes the customers throw, and then they go in an turn the knifes more after the customer leaves."
bad,It use to be fun then they started lowering the commission and taking away the fun of competitions. Very strict as far as attendance but they will try and work with you. I heard they fired a whole department for no valid reason so watch your step at this company btw the cable isn't free it cost.
bad,"Benefits are great at Comcast, but they evaluate their employees based on a outdated metric system. Management only cares about the numbers they see on their computer screens then whats actually happening in customers houses. Dispatch will run you rampant to the point your lucky if you have time to stop to relieve bodily functions and take breaks. They pretend to care and shove their benefits down your throat but its really not worth half the things you'll end up dealing with inside customers' homes. The company really doesn't realize how much their technicians save their butts with their vast knowledge of home electronics."
bad,"Management never had communication with understaff, you're just a number to management at Comcast. Felt like I never really had a job, and was always on the chopping block. It was never an understanding community and the supervisors heavily favor certain employees. Help is only given to employees that the supervisors preferred and was definitely not an equal opportunity situation. Management never listens to the issues of the employees and always believes their way is the only way. My direct supervisor in wallingford, pa, of the direct sales channel door to door lobbied for my termination because I was not part of her inner circle."
bad,I would never refer anyone to work for this company. They do not care about the well being of their employees. The management are not real leaders. They are just managers.
bad,"Comcast used to be a great place to work, but recent changes in management have resulted in a change to shifts and reduction in work/life balance at the company. They also tell you that you are able to advance, but I have found this to be far from true (at least in my Corp)."
bad,Not enough pay for the things that we endure and the economy is rising but the pay isn't. Supervisors were not knowledgeable on what to do most of the time.
bad,"This office is a great place to work several years, and recently became worse and worse on management and culture."
bad,"Can be an ok job, but the culture is one of favoritism. Seems like comcast cares more about patting themselves on the back for hiring based on checking a box, instead of quality of hire."
bad,Changed my job title and duties 7 times in year terrible manager never listened to any employees we all felt under pressure and not treated as equals we never got praise for our hard work.
bad,"While the pay is amazing, it is an extremely stressful job where you're not treated fairly at all. If you're just in it for the money, then it's great, but that wasn't enough to make me stay. You're constantly getting threats from customers, being yelled at by your manager no matter how great your numbers are, and you're just never seen as good enough."
bad,"Can not provide solutions to customer service issues. Bottom line driven without Customer service standards."
bad,"good envoirment to work in The company is an equal opportunity employer ace,, age, color, religion, national origin, veteran status, disability,, gender identity, genetic information or any characteristic protected by law."
bad,"I will never ever work for Comcast ever again. When management is biased & believe cx over employees, there is a REAL problem. No unity, no one to turn to, no support, no feeling valued."
bad,"The most repetitive, no room to grow unwilling to train job I have ever had.!!! I would never recommend this job to any one. I only stayed 2 months and that is not how I ever leave a job."
bad,"i would consider a better job opportunity after 8 years of employment, management does not care about their employees or their health or families, it is a company that is profit driven and doesn't care about the ""Human"" aspect of an employees or customer."
bad,Vitel communications was very disorganized. The people are great but their is a lack of communication between management and staff. the hardest part was not having enough equipment for all the techs and having to get them out in a timely fashion.
bad,"Just another cog in the wheel to a machine environment. As a technician, you are not a salesman. Even so, you must hit an annual sales stat to succeed in this environment. In general just a terrible experience."
bad,"This company provides cable, internet, phone and security service to it's customers but this job requires someone who likes working in a heavy sales environment.  There is a 4 week training program and you must agree to attend everyday."
bad,"This company continually finds new ways to make your job more stressful. They are constantly changing the rules as a means to limit commissions on sales.  Try calling them now and you will not get an American.  You will get someone in the Philippines or India or Monterey, Mexico.  Stressful dead end place to work.  Qualified sales calls are outsourced.  They expect you to sell top packages to single mothers in trailer parks who just want some cartoons for their kids."
bad,"They don't care about there employees work us like dogs, everything is blamed on the technicians, management sucks at what they do. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone and the pay is garbage."
bad,"Great place to work but the pay needs to be increased.  Dealing with yelling disrespectful customers that will belittle you is not worth the pay amount plus you have no days off for emergencies or illnesses during the first 90 days. The employees are friendly and welcoming which this is a plus but every move is monitored by the phone, can't leave your desk without coding your phone, feels like you're trapped in a chair for 8 hours."
bad,stay away management & HR are not truthful when speaking to you about situations of any kind. Its who you know and there is favoritism and back stabbing from other employees
bad,"re-organizations come about ever 6 month and the company wants to down size and keeps cutting people, this last one cut 9 people and made room for 15 new one at less pay and more work."
bad,"Comcast has a huge issue with customer delivery and service. It is poorly managed and operated.  The job itself, however, is fun.  Unfortunately, the reps are not duly rewarded for their efforts."
bad,"The job would have been fantastic if not for the business model and management infrastructure Comcast has. The Knoxville, TN location worked off of the buddy system. If the location promoted, based off of quality, safety, customer satisfaction, etc., then the job itself as a technician would have been great. The company does provide good tools and safety equipment. Just like any big company, I am sure Comcast also has bright spots in certain areas."
bad,"No room for growth. Unionized, so the raises that were bargained for were horrible. Because of the schedules, you had to work every weekend. Management treated the tech horribly. very petty."
bad,"work is fine, experience is great but the pay/billing system is sub par. Haven't gotten a decent paycheck since I started. hope for a career change soon"
bad,Contracting is good to do however this particular job lacked allot of help when tech issues were at hand. This was the first Company I serviced through Arise.com where I had so much trouble and could not get much assistance and or understanding.
bad,if you choose to work in Tinley park billing its not billing its sales they only care about selling. literally if you can talk people into buying things they dont want such as home phone service great! its about lying if you get hire use your training checks as time to find a new job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I worked in a call center doing retention. The benefits are great, but the ethics in this company are horrible. I could understand why the customers were unhappy because the customer service sucks, and you're taught in training not to care about the customers but make money. The money in training was great, but the production floor was ridiculous. If you're rude and could care less about a customer, go for it. Otherwise, you'd go home feeling like a terrible person everyday. Also, they're leaving my state, so the position is not concrete."
bad,"This company doesn't care about customers, they almost teach the way of thinking negative."
bad,"Back to back calls all day, little to no insight as to company changes or billing/promo changes. Frequent rep inaccuracies or misinformation leading to more corrections by competent reps and irate customers. Billing system is so berzerk and incomprehensible that you have to learn the nuances of the system to be able to use it effectively, which takes the standard rep no less than 9 months to be ""comfortable"" with it. "
bad,Management is not the smartest. the co- workers that I work with are the best
bad,"Atypical call center! Hard workload, inattentive managers and backwards corporate philosophy!"
bad,"Arrive at work, Complete micromanaged activities by 11am. Continue with daily activities, run meetings, continue training on new products, complete orders and turn it to sales assistants."
bad,"Worked at Comcast for 5 years, worst job I've ever had. Absolutely no possibility of advancement (as customer service) although I was given the opportunity to work from home which was great however the VPN was too slow to keep up and of course my overall stats paid the price for it. Constant rate increases with no addition of new content drove the customer base into a tizzy and more often than not customer service personnel were the last to hear of it. I felt for the customers as they generally had no alternatives and were stuck paying for overpriced unreliable service. Pay scale was ok; benefits were great (can't beat free cable and internet) but as a whole not the greatest job experience. The company knows it's got a bad rep and constantly begged the employees to uprate their reputation as the best place to work in IL."
bad,"Management for Comcast was not really supporting to getting problems fixed but more for sales oriented. Learned to be more technical from this job. The hardest part of the job was developing patience with people that are not technical at all, but is really rewarding when we are able to find a solution together."
bad,they do not care about you your just a number to them. safety is not imorttant to them.
bad,"Every year it was a little worse had a manager that didn't care because he was forced into the position, one didn't care about needs. i went through 11 managers in 15 years there. The co-workers were great the job was fairly easy as long as you did your job. I did learn how to manage my time so I could multi task to meet the needs of many while working in the warehouse. There really wasn't anything hard about the job the only hard part I would say would be adjusting to different management almost yearly."
bad,"Comcast now is promoting a new identity, Infinity is plastered all over their company vehicles. Their name has a bad stigma to it and they think this will help. The office next door to mine has been trying to get the comcast commercial service...it's taken 5 trips out here and it's still not working. nice"
bad,"They are implementing 'palakasan scheme' wherein if your affiliated with  site director or any top managers it's ewsy to climb even if you're not capable, and when you don't have those, even if you're a top performer you'll rot at entry level position."
bad,Aweful shift  hypocritical  Management your just a number here. Yes good benefits n perks. Your expected to break your back with no reward Super hard to advance without relocating to big cities.
bad,"I have been with the company for 8 years. They want you to believe that in the call center there is room for advancements, however there isn't any. The customer is always right and the metrics become harder to achieve with the lack of continued training and guidance from your supervisor. You are forced to stay because of the pay and benefits that other companies can't compete with. However being verbally abused on a daily basis is not for the faint of heart."
bad,After coming from a very collaborative work environment to an aggressive and extremely competitive environment was a culture shock. My stress level was so high I became physically ill and left the company.  They have a Boys club like mentality; management was able to be verbally abusive and HR did nothing about it.
bad,"Even though I was a recipient of, The National Sales, Superstar Award every year, (top 2% sales in the nation), Comcast took every opportunity to not pay. They eventually fired me for making too many sales and commissions."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Supervisors are clueless. You are constantly battling with repeats that you cant control. I.G. old customers that cant understand how to use the equipment, bad signal from the plant itself, slow maintenance responce etc. They want you in and out of a job in 45 mins but just doing the trace procedures takes about a 1hr. Then your supervisor is calling you every 10 mins rushing you to complete the job, but they wont answer their phones if you need help because they have no training on the equipment that also is faulty."
bad,"I hated being the rep I'd spoken to when a customer. The training is completely a loss when you get on the floor. They have a ""tell them whatever it takes to get them not to cancel on that call"" offer them more than allowed to, hang up if needed, basically be that person that if you've had to call Comcast, and speak to a supervisor? Always told send to their voicemail, which I caught them just deleting over and over without even listening. Quit shortly after I actually started working the job itself"
bad,Its easy to be blinded by benefits. Overall if youre not selling you dont have a job without pressure. Ironically this is not even the sales department we are talking about.
bad,"Benefits are good management the worst down here in southwest florida the manager needs to go makes decisions even if it doesn't coexist with policies has all supervisors and employees walking on egg shell company initiatives are customer first punishes employees when they think customer first."
bad,"The benefits were great but a bit pricey. Wonderful perks. However, you are constantly pressured to meet unrealistic quotas and even if you hit plan they want you to hit 150% before being recognized. The supervisor they had over me sucked. She was extremely moody and sassy, never had an effective way of answering questions of employees without sassing them. She cared more about how people felt about her than actually helping people. They switched our campaign and we did not have adequate training on it. They gave the new people four weeks of training on the new campaign and gave us four hours and expected us to be able to hit a high quota still. Didn’t feel like you could go above the supervisor to management or hr because it felt as thought they all were in cahoots with each other."
bad,"After 7 years with Comcast I was let go on a whim, so where most of the leadership and management. Even the site director. We we given clues the culture would change within the company but no (as a supervisor) given clear commands that it needed to change. Comcast has a fast paced work environment and enjoys people who follow rather than lead. Great benefits, really good pay. But you never know what will happen."
bad,"My experience at was felt similarly and shown in kind by my colleagues who also  soon discovered we had to bring imbibing  beverage to work in an atmosphere so toxic and aggressive to get through shifts.  Comcast attested to impede the completion of my education in order to align with their predatory agenda which could have railroaded most.  However, I left and will a Masters in months."
bad,"Recent Management and supervisor made for a stressful work environment, and vacation were next to impossible to take.  Almost 10 years with the company only to find out what your truly worth in the end, thanks Comcast."
bad,We sit at our desks waiting for call. And all we hear that our service sucks and to expensive. Management know service sucks and we got to hear it from the customers all day
bad,Company is a go go company if u leave or try to transfer they wont even give u the time of day.once u leave or transfer they forget about u.although u do get a company truck tools and uniform.
bad,Great place to work you will become tech savvy because there is so much to learn. You have to enjoy working with the public customer service oriented. My position was in management so I had many responsibilities. There was training and bonuses for your hard work.
bad,"There is a lot of favoritism within the company. If you are outside the cliche you are unprotected. The job is constantly changing, even for the role you are hired for. The benefits, aside from the pay scale is great, the pay is undercompensated. The company has opportunity for advancement with your existing role, but it is difficult to advance beyond that role or into a leadership position can be difficult. The company culture has increased, because at one time it was highly toxic, and it felt like it was beginning to turn that way once again."
bad,"Tolerable place to work bad pay people yell at you a lot, Management dont care a bought you your constantly changing work shifts, benefits not good work scheduled not good"
bad,Very high level of stress. Must be a phone person. This department deals alot with elderly people. Need an extreme amount of patience. Also be able to deal with some verbal abuse from customers over the phone.
bad,"A typical day: answering calls all day. Very high pressure to sell to meet almost unachievable goals and harassed and threatened by management if you miss one or more goals. The workplace culture with co-workers is mostly positive but with supervisors and managers, not so much. The hardest part of the job was putting up with the harassment and threats from my last supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits."
bad,poor manegement poor way of showing and training not professional way of dealing with employees treated us like we were not on same level as any on else
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for! As a technician you are constantly stressed out about your metrics and they are only getting harder and harder every year. In order to progress your career you have to maintain good numbers for a certain amount of time and if you don’t, you aren’t even considered for a position, even if you are interested in a completely different department. This company is EXTREMELY performance based! Management only cares about your numbers and that’s it. We constantly bring up that we are overworked but noting gets done about it and they start worrying about whether we have uploaded certain scans at every job. They say you cannot be fired for numbers but I know for a fact that’s not true (not me but a friend of mine)."
bad,"The hiring managers and store managers are positive and motivating. The teams are very diverse and most of us quickly connected and worked really well together.  I made some good friends in the short six months period  I worked there. The customers are rude, frustrated, looking to play the system.  The Services provided are excellent. The few service installation technicians I dealt with were friendly and professional. Retail is tough and making your quota takes finesse and hard work. The customers that are coming into the stores are not looking to buy, they are tired of being shuffled around on the phone, or need to exchange a faulty service box.  These are fairly simple transactions.  The billing reviews and upgrades on service plans was what broke my heart.  The plans available were nothing like what the customer signed up with.  The cost would almost double and they just couldn't believe the price was only good for 6 months or a year promotional period."
bad,I believe the contractor 8 worked for was a con artist it was very hard to get my pay on time the conditions we worked under were harsh rain sleet snow. I did enjoy working with the customers but other then that i would never work with a contractor for comcast again.
bad,wast of time supervisor are lost and complaining about technical things they dont have clue about it. working there is like not been a human they treat you like robot never ask if you want to grow on your career
bad,great company great pay very little job security and they really know how to show you a good time while you work there. don't get your hopes up ......
bad,"Overworked, stressful, management only cares about numbers and sales.. they try to boost morale with free stuff like calendars, free lunch sometimes, but not flexible with time off have to bid for shifts.strict monitoring, barely go to bathroom, typical call center."
bad,"Basically the only thing that kept me around was the benefits. The pay decreased due to center changes and the leadership team sucked. When they decide they want you gone,out the door you go. I dont recommend them because it is a stressful environment."
bad,"Login to all windows to be used throughout the day"
bad,"Good health benefits, Bad management. Not equal to all employees, let the lazy workers be lazy and unaccountable, and expected more out the people who worked hard and did their job."
bad,"I would not recommend here. The pay is good and so are the benefits, but that doesn't make up for the poor management. Also they downsized departments when they merged with NBC."
bad,"Better Lunch and break areas for each building, a lot of management change and a little more movement in promotions would be an add bonus. micro management is a bonus when you are a new hire, once you have proven yourself less would be less stressful, also more setting where we are not having to share desks"
bad,Comcast does not care at all for their employees.  The environment is toxic and upper management simply abuses and berates employees every day.  They claim to listen to employees but they don't - they superficially address employee concerns.
bad,They show way to much favoritism very stressful the pay is good but it is not really worth the stress and the fact they mess up the pay a lot and fix it on their time not worth the headache
bad,"I was the only Hispanic in my group, The manager knew this girl was always pointing out the obvious and he never did nothing. I was there to make good money and I quite this job to get a real career. I'm happy and better off."
bad,"Don't work here. Bad management, your on your own when things go wrong with your equipment, problems, etc. You don't get paid right on your commissions and no manager to help fix it. The list goes on."
bad,"You have never been micromanaged like you have here.  The verbal and mental abuse you experience from customers calling is does not make the pay or benefits worth it at all.  You will experience an advanced level of office drama.  Management is very unreliable when escalations are needed.  A definite ""brown nose"" environment."
bad,"While the compensation at Comcast is very nice, the way we are trained to ""sell"" is not very moralistic. We are basically told to lie to customers about packages and pricing in order to get sales."
bad,"I worked in the warehouse at Comcast off of 45th st in West Palm Beach,FL and if you go there watch your back. These people smile in your face, but run to management and talk a bunch of lies about you behind your back. I lost my job cause of this and i thought there was no problem. Nobody approached me to find out what any issues. If there was a problem I discussed it with person i had a problem with. Apparently they didnt do the same. The job was easy and the pay was great, but not the people."
bad,My review is based off of the facility in which I worked.  The management was terrible.  HR was unhelpful and didn't seem to offer much help when they were needed.  Only options for advancement seemed to be if you knew the right person.
bad,"They tell you that you are in control of your future in the company, but if someone in management doesn't like you for any reason, you are unable to move up in the company. They are constantly asking for your opinion on how to make things better within the company, listen to your advice, agree, but don't do anything especially if it goes against their opinion. Treat employees poorly if they don't sell. Customers aren't the problem. It's your coworkers and management. Be prepared for shotty tools, be told to sell sell sell. Services and benefits and wage is how they get you."
bad,"Comcast give us techs unrealistic goals to meet and when we find a way to meet them they say we cant do it that way anymore which make our jobs impossible. Other than that they a perfect work life balance 4 days 10 hrs but if you choose to go you should know you are underpaid compared to all their competitors."
bad,"worst job I've ever had even the great benefits wasn't enough to outweigh the negative and make me want to stay. Management was snaky, making it a very uncomfortable, low moral and back stabbing environment. High turnover. We started off with a small group of about 35 amazing people about 10 of us have left in less than 3 months and more are planning to leave. Commission structure was horrible and quotas were aggressive and unrealistic. The Comcast center is beautiful and we did have access to it. Received a lot of freebies from their partner companies. ."
bad,"No security at Comcast, I've lost count of number of employees that avg 20 years in the company and have been forced out just because, without justified reason. Do not value employees, Unlivable work culture.  Those who have not yet been forced out are on the verge of a heart attack."
bad,"This is a very secure job they will work with you....unfortunately you'll rather they just fire you. All together its a terrible place to work. The only thing that's consistent there is change. Policies the way, your performance is judged, uniforms, everything. Its too much to deal with most of the time. but you'll be expected to shoulder on and deal. The metrics are impossible to keep up with and the job routing is just terrible. all in all I wouldn't work here."
bad,"I took incoming calls about cable service. I assisted with the activation, if needed and disconnection, if needed for each customer."
bad,"Days typically consist of putting out multiple fires throughout the day, with unnecessary meetings and conference calls that prevent the ability to adequately coach and develop direct reporting employees. Upper leadership expects employees to dedicate any/all time (including personal time) to answer e-mails and address issues. There is no work/life balance here. Upper leadership indicates the need and desire to improve customer service and environment, but all actions indicate this is still a company exclusively focused on numbers and profit. Worst work experience of my career."
bad,"Answering irate customer calls all day is tough enough, but when management is hammering on you more and more it becomes a work environment that makes everyone want to get out of Comcast.  This is true for even top performers - no one is good enough."
bad,"It's a legitimate job with full benefits, discounted internet, TV and phone service. The actual job is very difficult. Face-to-face customer service is what the customer expects, and face-to-face SALES is what the company expects. Customers are often angry, and only more frustrated after waiting in a 30 minute line. Now try to up-sell the mean guy with a mustache who has been through 3 modems in the past week in an effort to get his phone to work. "
bad,"Male Management of this company is not receptive nor tolerant towards veterans, there seemed to be alot of hostility towards veterans with combat action experience."
bad,"I worked at Comcast for only half a year, due to the fact that despite my direct supervisors assistance, his managers were complete BumHoles. They didnt care if he gave one his teammates time in another Aux to get personal affairs in order, affairs that came to be due to the lack of attention from the job itself, the floor managers would bark orders daily if you so much as breathed in another aux. Many times I would be on call with payroll or HR in regards to job issues and the floor managers would literally come up to your desk very loudly and bark at you that you should be doing this on your own personal time, despite my direct supervisor giving me the okay to do so. After six months I called it quits, and I'm sure my supervisor was right behind me."
bad,"I felt like I couldn't be me..it was more ""hurry up and buy""..not my way to do business. You don't create a problem to false solve a problem and then create more fake solutions to the problems you started."
bad,"You had to meet 100 different metrics or more at each job, several times a day.  You could meet 99 and fail because one of them was near impossible to achieve.  Management was horrible and took very little responsibility.  The work itself is great, but management and metrics completely ruin the job experience."
bad,I like working with ppl but the manager really didn't  know how to rout techs all ways got out of the warehouse late so my two early morning appointment would be late so I would work threw break an lunch to catch up hanks warehouse
bad,"They put up a really big front, telling you all about how great it will be to work there and selling you on all of the benefits. If you care about actually helping customers and feel bad about misleading people though this isn't the place for you. I stayed for almost 3 years because of the pay, but in the end I left due to moral reasons and extremely poor management."
bad,"Where do I start, the company used to be much better than it is today. Now management has gotten overly money hungry (which I can understand most employers do) and have made sales targets nearly unrealistic to achieve since joe white (senior manager) had came in the building as of summer 2018. I would not go back at all, pay is good but it honestly is a very stressful job."
bad,"I've tried for a position in Comcast/Xfinity 3 times now. 1st try I failed the assessment and the personality questions since they do not pertain to the job in the first place."
bad,"If you have a husband/wife and / or kids this is not the job for you. I worked at the Charleston SC office and it was a horrible experience. After weeks of training watching Jimmy Fallen, multiple outside smoke breaks, followed by 2 weeks of training with the systems I would be using daily I was allegedly qualified enough to help customers with issues. “Yay” me:-(. Not only do you have to shift bid, which I was not advised of before accepting the position not during the interview or by my recruiter. I was asked if I had availability between 5am and 11pm. I’m thinking I would have a shift somewhere in between 5am and 11pm. Nope we had a “shift bid” in training by our hire date and unfortunately the shift that was left was a shift that I would never see my kids. I should of quit then but I didn’t my pay was 18.06 with the 2 dollar difference for working overnight so I sacrificed a little while longer. They normally have 2 or 3 shift bids a year and depending on your stats that will determine what shift you have to work Morning shift, mid afternoon or to midnight there would be normally 15 shifts to choose from. My supervisor was very smart but acted like it did know anything. The supervisors talk about there employees to co-workers. They tell you there is no time limit to talk to customers but if your on the phone helping customers past your lunch/ break it’s counted against you. I found out quick I would need to work off the clock assisting customers with issues if I didn’t want any points taken off for helping customers during my break/lunch. Xfinity Mobile does not have great"
bad,"My experience was somewhat unique.   Was hired by an incredible and capable leader.  Unfortunately, he retired two months in and the person who took his place was well out of his league in the VP role.  He micro managed me, took all the credit for the good that my team was doing and fabricated things to make me look bad."
bad,"They spend money to train you and then fire you because you don’t make the 3 month goal that changed from month to month.   It seems like a great company at first but soon after, you start to see what it is really like."
bad,I already explained I left due to sexually Harassment. This company does not take care of their employees well being they care more about pushing problems under the mat then fixing them!
bad,The company was better before a new manager came in and changed everything. he is now highly disliked by almost all of the current technicians. But im just one person.
bad,"Was there 18 years and never gave me a chance in promotion."
bad,"I have been with Comcast for a little over a year, I've learned how too manage a non stop area always busy, the hardest part would be to make sure the new guys complete they task.  I really enjoyed this job."
bad,"comast is only worried about sales, if you like to sell and want to work 1230pm to 9pm then this is the job for you. they lie to you at orientation and tell you sales arent important yet if you dont make sales then you will lose you job. managers are extremely phony and are programmed to get their employees to sell sell sell"
bad,"After Comcast took over, they began to micro manage to much,  Supervisor  was a felon and got promoted to manager. Lots of people in charge that should not have been."
bad,"find another place to work if you can...don't look for long term if you want to work and get free cable cool, if not look to work for another company. I really wasn't interested in filling out this"
bad,"Comcast does have amazing benefits such as 401k, health, dental, discount services if you live in a Comcast area. However, Comcast techs are paid below industry average, The work itself is not difficult and although most customers are aggravated upon tech arrival the interaction with the customers is not too bad either. Comcast installation and service techs are blamed for all that happens be it customer service on the phone has completely lied to the customer or the tech is not on time, usually due to poor routing by the Comcast routing and dispatch centers or over loaded time frames. The customer service reps have such a high turn over they are very rarely knowledgeable or educated in the field to be of any assistance and so relate false information to the customers. Everything is metric based so there is accountability for everything which would be good except the techs know how to circumvent this process. There is a survey for all that is done which is rigged so the share holders only receive good reports which entails in the mega bonuses for the CEO's. For the most part managers and supervisors are good but are struggling through their day just like every service tech that do not actually care about customer service as long as the numbers look good. Comcast is a very liberal and diverse company."
bad,"Lack of professional growth."
bad,"Working for Comcast was one of the worst experiences of my life. "
bad,Not enough staff its a great job very fast paced and a little stressfull at times but great work experiences get to talk to people from different states. management not so well
bad,"Most people hate xfinity regardless of the best technology in the industry and those people are the same ones that making working for the company difficult to work for. The company overall is great but out of touch with the daily interactions sales reps have to deal with. Comcast is not cheap. period. But customers are still expecting 1987 pricing and tech. In order to have the best you have to pay a little more and its not the people in the stores that make the prices. Also yes the call center is outsourced, get over it, most are. Don't take your frustration out on the person trying to help."
bad,"I loved working for Comcast, my co workers were wonderful.I would have retired from Comcast,but down sizing got in the way."
bad,"Comcast is a good place to work as long as you don't have to rely on your local management to for support.  After many years of service and awards at Comcast, it's unfortunate that young, arrogant, yes man supervisors have to come in and flex there power and run great techs off without hesitation. Pay is good, benefits are good, perks are good, but poor management can not make up for the pros of the job."
bad,Turn on all my systems needed for work. I always workedwth two moniters. I adhered to two inbound call shifts throughout the day where I had to identify hotleads for potential sales opertunities. I alsohad to search various sales leads to also uncover sales opportunities. I learned to be very organized and focused on daily goals. My co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part was hitting my sales quota. Management could have been more supportive. Mstenjoyable part was that I was always busy doing something. I love that.
bad,"I did almost three years exactly at Comcast.  It was like a prison sentence.  I was on commission so my pay was pretty good--I could sell, but oh my god, what a terrible place.  No communication between departments, no accountability with technicians or dispatch, and for a year I had a sales supervisor that may have been the worst manager in captivity."
bad,"This is a call center with inbound calls. My day was spent taking phone calls and selling as many products as possible. I did learn how to become an effective salesperson. When it comes to management, none of them know what is ever going on. The reason Comcast has terrible customer service is because of the lack of knowledge with the employees as well. I loved the co-workers I worked with around me, but the hardest part of the job is trying to stay up-to-date with the bipolar management. I did love all of the benefits that they offered."
bad,Extremely micro-managed with unrealistic and immoral expectations.
bad,"While employed at Comcast cable I had there opportunity to learn different positions with in the company such as sales, retention billing, and repair. I was able to learn while gaining experience in each field. i enjoyed the daily interactions with the customers and the ability to resolve there issues."
bad,"No future, as soon as you make good money they want to replace you with someone who will do it for less. They have call centers in other countries."
bad,"i worked in tech support-u call and scream because your internet stopped working, or your cable went out. Forced to take 15 calls an hour. All calls were recorded-tech support was forced to sell products as company eliminates sales team. Alot of nasty people calling-being rude. The system is so computerized- they can monitor my screen from main office-took away internet and tv- its a cable company-and has hundreds of tv's mounted on the walls-which were all cut off."
bad,"Comcast is a huge company that cannot make changes fast enough in the tech industry.  They value their television product so much even though it is by far their worst product.  Comcast has great internet and pays employees nothing to sell it. They pay you to sell the bundles including tv, ancient home phone, and home security system that can’t compete.   If you aren’t selling all of the products all the time you are going to make a fraction of what your colleagues are making"
bad,"Comcast was only worried about the numbers, comcast stopped wanting us to treat the client like people and was only wanted the number.  Comcast want me to compromise my customer service values, or what was once there values to the customer, that was not something that I would do."
bad,It's all business nothing personal I wish it was a little more personal and they actually will judge the situation according to the person however employees are just numbers to them. On a third strike forgot to lock one of my truck doors and was fired. Because my supervisor inspected it a minute before i came out to check my doors were locked.
bad,"I have no one to blame but myself. I was told you will earn $100,000 your first year. I knew that was not true and only there top reps earn that. I asked them if I work really hard here can I make $55,000 that is what I need to pay my bills.I was told no problem, absolutely no worries.I should of know better I have been in sales a long time. They hire like crazy only about 5 percent stay a year. Because they set up people with unrealistic and unattainable goals."
bad,Advancement could've been better and treatment of workers. I enjoyed my time with Comcast but it's time to learn new things. Also training could be better
bad,"I was an employee at Comcast for over 2 years. The work was enjoyable, easy to learn, fellow team mates were helpful and hardworking. There wasn’t much to complain about aside from the management team needing major improvement and the lack of clear communication within the entire company. Supervisors would tell you one thing like, “don’t get repeats” or’ “don’t leave a house with ingress (wiring issue)”. They would not give you CLEAR instruction of how to do that in EVERY situation. For example, if you close a job the wrong way in their opinion, even if you feel you were correct, to protect your self from closing a job with ingress it could cost you your job. The management team also instructs you that you should be independent and make decisions on your own but if they do not like the decision you made they will write you up and say why didn’t you call. So if you want to work here good luck to you but have a back up plan cause one mistake could be your last if it’s one management doesn’t like, no second chances or prior warning."
bad,"A work place where u can leave 15,000 dollars out and keep your job but dont meet your sales you get fired. They want you to lie to people and get older.people to sign up for packages they dont need and if you refuse you might as well just quit. It dont matter how great your customer service is, it dosent matter that you can run the system like the back of your hand, if you wont lie then dont even apply."
bad,"I always wanted to work for this company. Heard so many great things. In training we are treated so good but once we start everything changes. The system and information to learn with this company takes a good 4 months before you feel comfortable selling and speaking to a customer. Since I have started I have felt I am going to lose my job because of sales performance. The area I work in there are a lot of Spanish speaking customers who only want to speak to the Spanish employees. This takes away from my sales because everyone is waiting for Spanish speaker. We have weekly huddle meetings with manager it’s suppose to be helpful to identify strengths and weaknesses but what it really does is get you discouraged when your manager tells you, you are going to be entered in a performance program to improve sales. If the program doesn’t work the company fires you. Call centers are not a good place for sales because they want you to turn dirt into gold customers do not want to buy. We are forced to cell mobile and home security with no display models and it’s not easy to do so. Here in the x stores we are able to show customers the true value of what they  are purchasing. Overall I would’ve appreciated the job more if I didn’t have to stress so much about not performing how the managers and company would like us to.  Management is only sales hungry and they do not care about the process of the sales just as long as you are hitting at least 50% in every metric."
bad,"HR isn't there for the employee, they're there to protect the company. You're told one thing, and then another thing happens completely opposite. They always want more and make it next to impossible to advance in your position. And if you want to move to a different department, they make that next to impossible too."
bad,"Supervisors, management, HR, and some administrative staff have little empathy for their hard working employees. Focusing on making corporate happy. I feel this location has been given the keys to a Super Sport but only ever driven a sedan. Corporate decisions are still managing what the utility of this location is and that can effect someone in a commission role. The site can not control calls from flyers meant for a brand new customer accidentally ending up in existing customers mailboxes. When your commission relies on your percentage of sales per call, it's easy to draw the conclusion that the $0.15 flyers could save Comcast millions across the nation in commission. There is no solution for this problem. Maybe a class Action Lawsuit but this is Comcast. You are better off as a tech, other customer service role in Comcast or working somewhere else, just be careful of a commission structured position."
bad,"Long hours , Lots of work ,No overtime, Numbers for rework must be below 7 percent and Pht must be at 98%"
bad,job was very competitive and very stressful tons of manipulation and holding things over your head. everything was micromanaged and lying to customer was forcibly encouraged
bad,"Comcast has no respect over there employees family matters, or how long the job at hand takes to complete, they over power the workload in the amount of time to complete they make the employees work how ever many hrs it takes to complete the client list they supply for one day"
bad,"As a Technician, Everything is your fault. No matter how well you've done your job. Should the customer call in to the service center that is your fault."
bad,"Stressful call center job. "
bad,"very fast paced, high call voulume, working different system at once multitasking, trouble shooting comcasting services.  Assisting technicians over the phone with work order,  Also scheduling appoints for new installs or trouble calls."
bad,If your are mechanically and technically inclined then this is the job for you. be prepared to do some hard work. COmcast benefits package is amazing.
bad,"Don't apply unless you actually like door to door sales.  In the spring time it wasn't too bad but once it hit the winter time it was awful.  The days start getting dark around 430 and the weather is cold.  Most people didn't wanna answer the door cause it was so late and you couldn't see house number either. "
bad,"Comcast overall as a company could use some adjusting. The level of customer service expected is not the level delivered. what is expected of the workers is set to high, to the point where we have to act like robots. its almost impossible to make mistake without the fear of losing your job. every little thing counts against you. the call volume on a day to day basis and the number of calls that are expected to be taken creates high anxiety and stress. the design of the attendance policy is not manageable for real life. some of the management are understanding and others only look out for themselves. i can honestly say that the pay is pretty good 12.00/ hour + the opportunity to make commission, as well as great health benefits. however, the actual job will drive you crazy. you have to put up with customers screaming at you and cursing you out, all while trying to solve their issue, up-sell, and retain current business. in the process of doing this there is a call flow that you must adhere to. there are certain things you can and cant say. this is all apart of the Quality Assurance team. you have to relate and empathize, verify certain information to determine if you can even talk to a customer, ask questions regarding the customers concern, and asking questions about missing products (i.e. cable internet or phone) and trying to sell them on that product. aside from assisting angry customers on a day to day basis, there are certain numbers that have to be met each fiscal month (21st-21st of each month) such as: cpph (calls per productive hour), adherence (complying to daily schedule"
bad,ok job to work at. has its flawes. need more money other than just commission
bad,"Metrics are hard to maintain (when I was there, you had to resolve all calls, (even with the most angry, irate customers), within a certain timeframe or its counted against you, along with the amount of times a costume calls back for the same issue, which is ridiculous because anyone who works in customer service knows that some customers often callback repeatedly simply because they don't like what they were told initially, even when its correct and within company policy. Also management was horrible and often wasn't available to assists employees and customers, which happened on a daily basis here (team leads would simply leave the floor every day without a care), extremely high call volume (with the majority of customers being ready to bite your head off), the only plus was the free cable and decent paycheck."
bad,"compensation was good, poor management and no opportunity for growth"
bad,This job was a really good learning experience for me because I saw first hand that hard work will help you advance within the company.
bad,its an okay company to work for but I want I need a place were I can move up at.
bad,Answering inbound phone calls about billing and troubleshooting.
bad,dont work for them  they will ruin you and end up ruining your life.  I really dont appreciate having to fill all this out.  i dont see how this is going to help you.
bad,I worked on att project and you are required to sale on every call you have to basically get involved in people lives even if they are upset they say no favoritism but there is most shifts are 10 hour and pay is twice a month.
bad,I enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience. The lunch breaks sucked. The sales goal requirements sucked because it's like this if you don't meet the goal then you're gone. No leads no money. I wouldn't work for them again
bad,Very stressful job. Been there 12 years then got laid off with no other options. No room for advancement. Changes all the time and you can’t seem to do anything right. Age discrimination at an all time high.
bad,No job security nor sympathy from corporate. The direct sales department was closed down two weeks before Christmas without warning. More than 100 people lost their jobs.
bad,"A typical work day has me overseeing dozens of employees. I ensure that their goals are met, that they have what they need to be productive, and that the needs of the company are being fulfilled. I will communicate via email with nearly every level of Comcast management to help solve problems and institute company policy."
bad,i would not recommend comcast due to it's managerial style. The job I had was fast paced but doable .The benefits were very good and the hours were reasonable.
bad,This job is great but since i work from home now i am burnt out and no management support. I would like to be in an office again around other people...
bad,"typical day at work.... finish one job get tossed 3 more, was never able to arrive on time for most jobs, customers were extremely upset, vehicles were in horrible condition, as a customer facing technician we had it bad. set boxes rarely worked, most of the equipment was never checked, roaches would come free with most set top boxes. nothing was enjoyable, only a few managers. under paid and over worked. our skill set was worth $28-$34 but were paid $16 per hour. terrible company to work for."
bad,"The best thing about this job is the co workers. The benefits are okay. Alot of time off. But work/life balance isnt that great. Supervisors are always on you about metrics. Numbers numbers numbers. Your numbers can be great for a couple of months with no issues until you have a bad month then your integrity as a technician is put into question.  And then all of a sudden you start receiving corrective actions for little things so they can get you out the door. Its not about the customer its about metrics. The pay is terrible for the type of work you do (climbing poles, getting into attics, rewiring houses, correcting mistakes that contractors didnt correct, angry customers, faulty equiptment and management on your behind. At&t deals with the same amount of issues but atleast they get paid well for it and they have union."
bad,"People competent in their jobs got little to no advancement, and more work. Incompetent co-workers perpetually have jobs, while others did their jobs for them. Management made incredibly dumb choices, and propaganda from Corporate."
bad,"This company has a problem with micro management, they are a cog in the wheel company and an old fashioned place to work for. There products are top of the line, yet there management is low class and awful. This is a good job for someone trying to start there career venture, and a good place to learn how to sell product (TV, Internet and Phone Packages)."
bad,"Pay is okay, stressful environment. Company does not care about employees. Attendance structure and compensation structure changes without a benefit to employees. Expected to do more than paid."
bad,comcast is very stressful atmosphere  dont care about anyone poor pay for all they want you to do you have to sale even if your not in that department they grade all your calls and it prevents you from ever moving up
bad,Comcast has just fired agents that have been with them for years for a budget cut and because the agents did over time. If you are looking for a long time career don’t dealwith Comcast
bad,I think Comcast as a company is ok. However I have seen a lot of dishonest behavior from coworkers in my area. Some techs flat out lie to customers. We also have a lot of customers who complain about hacking issues through their wi fi. I am currently looking for work elsewhere as I can't handle the false environment
bad,This company really doesn't care at all about the people they employ. really anyone off the street could get a job at this place. I would no recommend this place to work
bad,"You have to use Vac days for everything sick days, accidents, whatever. Also the turnover is crazy because the respect they have for T1 agents is none. No bathroom breaks, double jeopardy stats, they always looking for a way to dismiss you. 1 min or 7.5 hours have the same consequences. It's just not a great place to start entry level. Steer clear unless you need a job take it and then work on finding a better one. It's bearable in training. And that gives you 6 weeks to get outta there."
bad,"Awful!! If you need to get your foot in the door of an office job, take it and bide your time. It's a robot job. You do collections in billing and are dinged if you don't up sell. They just got an extension on the $800 they owe and clearly can't afford it. Not customer friendly at all."
bad,Comcast did not appreciate their employees.  There was a lot of favoritism.  I didn't feel that being on time and present everyday was good enough.  My last supervisor was not fair.  The other supervisors I had was very nice.
bad,"If you enjoy life, don’t work here! Especially if you have kids!!! The only good thing is the pay. Hours are horrible and customers matter more than employees. They are strictly for customers and if employees stand up for themselves, you’re fired. Managers and floor supervisors are petty and basically determine if you keep your job. Just don’t waste your time or energy. The best part is meeting new people while working."
bad,Horrible leadership . they don't appreciate good employees pretending is to Care not the same.  entitlements favorites .the leadership is picked not on what you know how you know
bad,"Very very very stressful and overwhelming ,I wouldn’t recommend that job to my worst enemy, walking around Walmart pitching different people to buy Comcast, it was a horrible nightmare"
bad,"I worked for the company for almost 15 years with excellent yearly reviews and consistently meeting goals.  I was passed over twice when apply for management positions.  I am a female and both times a male was hired, first was a man outside the company and the second was a man who had worked for comcast for about a year.  At the time I applied for these positions I had been employed there for nearly 13 years.  Seems like a sexist issue going on in this store."
bad,only good thing about working comcast is you get comcast cable/network discounts - most supervisors & managers have zero knowledge on how to manage employees
bad,Comcast wants the employees to lie to the customer and that does not set well with me.  When you truly try to help people you do not have the support from your management team.
bad,Training was for 4 months and a few trainers were very unprofessional as well as management. Wouldnt recommend Comcast to anyone. Good Luck with that.
bad,"Your day and life are totally uncertain working at Comcast Xfinity. Your daytime start, changes throughout the week, and you never know what time your day will end. If dispatch puts a job on your route you are required to go and complete it. It could be midnight by the time you get home. Management does not care. It's the all for one, and all for me (supervisor ) attitude. "
bad,"The technician position is extremely stressful. Management is absolutely tyrannical. No concern for an employees well being. That is how they drive personal $60,000 to $80,000 vehicles. If you enjoy being belittled by superiors then this is the company for you."
bad,"Comcast has great benefits and the pay is excellent, but senior management done care about what you have going on in your life!! Comcast is not a place to work at if you have kids because they do not recognize doctors excuses!!! If the supervisor don’t like you anything you do you will be placed on a final. If you placed on a final you will be terminated at your 1 year anniversary because you can not progress!!! Upper management steal commission!!! Lie to employees, don’t care long as you selling, force you to lie to customer"
bad,Fasted paced environment to work in. Company is awesome to work with culture is amazing. only thing I highly recommend they do is tuition reimbursement for part time employees.
bad,Laid off from Comcast. The company hired people to this position and then reduced workforce only a couple of months later. No indication that a Re-Org was likely. Dishonest and did not handle lay-offs particularly well.
bad,Comcast corporate and regional offices care about their employees as much as they care about their customers. Good employees below the leadership level in every system; employees do care and do work hard.
bad,"cable tech, My job was service and installing and customer service. I install routers, channel boxes, phone lines, wifi modems..............................."
bad,"Show up on time."
bad,"Toxic work environment. Corporate vultures. Hypocrisy rules and expectations are completely out of whack, lies and broken promises are the norm. Stay away if you can."
bad,Management for my department does not know where to take us. We keep going through changes supposedly to make the customer experience better but no real improvement in our department.
bad,Xfinity definitely gets a bad rep and that was my reasoning for why I wanted to go to them because of that hostility that people throw you for even mentioning the word xfinity so it was a great learning experience.
bad,"Providing Outstanding Customer Service Handling Outbound And Inbound Calls Trouble Shooting Transferring Calls From Different Departments That's Best For Helping New And Valuable Customers, Also Accepting Bill Payments."
bad,"This company do not offer a full time position. only part time. It's hard to sale internet to older people that on a fix income and do not kwon how to use a computer, older people also don't need to upgrade their cable because they are use to a few channels, and they been with their phone company for so long that they don't want to change."
bad,If I am forced to say something about comcast i would say that it is a horrible company that pays you very well to work for. as long as you feel ok robbing people
bad,would be better to be paid for all the positions we now are vs what we're hired as and don't get paid more for taking on a lot more work. No benefits for customers.
bad,"Continue with your dreams, do not stop at a temp services. Its only a stepping step. And make sure you look out for you because the company will not.."
bad,A typical work day consisted of Supervisors being dedicated to their employees with a can do and will do attitude.  Whether I was a direct report I hadn't encountered anyone from upper management that was not committed to bettering their employees.
bad,"Long hours awful  management money hungry."
bad,"Worked six days 10 hour shifts but only get paid for 40 hours (salary) You will get commission but is heavily taxed about 40%,you always have to answer company phone and be on conference calls regardless if your off, on vacation, in a beach in Mexico. No work life balance whatsoever, extremely stressful, if you get a good manager it will be a little bit easier and maybe you get 2 days off a week MAYBE. Very disorganized department. Only good thing is the benefits and pay. Think twice if you have a family and would like to spend time with them. Hours were usually 10am-8:30 or 9pm or 7:30am-7 or 8pm. If your single and like stress and don't mind always having to be on conference calls on your days off or when on vacation then this is the job for you! Good luck!"
bad,get paid to lie to customers and decieve them into signing contracts under false pretenses while hoping to meet ever changing and unrealistic sales goals.
bad,"Customers are treated poorly, because that is how management wants it to be.  It's all about the SALE and not the save. If you would like to work in a hamster bowl than I say join Comcast's call center."
bad,"Working with Comcast was not a good experience for me. Long hours, supervisors not really helpful. You feel like you are working in a dog pit."
bad,Not a very good company to work for. We were treated like numbers and not people. no raises or bonuses. dishonest staff.A different boss every 3 months.
bad,Comcast is not concerned with its employees needs. They demand to much from its employees.
bad,"ell us about:"
bad,At Comcast you will work hard for a good company and be compensated fairly.
bad,"a typical day at work, the most enjoyable job good pay went out f business"
bad,loved working outside and meeting people new expierence everday
bad,"On a Monday morning, about 11 clock am an angry customer service came in making a lot of noise about her bill. I was already dealing with a customer that was in front of my window, as she continue to make a loud noise, i quickly came up to her and told her what was the issue and she said my bill is to high. I was asking her do you mind giving me 15 minute and i can help her with her billing issue. she sat down and waiting patiently. As i was done with my previous customer i ask her to come to my window and looked at her bill and i saw her cable bill came up to 356.00, as i resolved the issue i lower her bill gave her free movie channel, sport, and high speed internet under 100 dollar for 8 month and she was happy as she can be."
bad,love being able to help the need. they really played a big part in my day. what makes me happy is to see others happy. I really enjoy the type of work that I do.
bad,"Selling & fun working atmosphere, its ok looking for something better."
bad,The company was great to work for but the employees and power plays were not.  Tough work life balance.  Worked from 6am to 10pm daily including weekends for 5 months straight.
bad,"this company lies to you from the get go and tells you to basically rip off the customers,,, i would never buy from d 2 d salesman ever"
bad,Company too large to sustain creativity. Micro management stifles true salesmanship
bad,"Make good money but its a lot to do to get the money, sales are goals are hard to meet especially with so much competition out there"
bad,This was door door sales in which I would try to upgrade customers or try and sign up new customers.
bad,"it was a pay check, people really did not speak much for whatever reason"
bad,My supervisor was the best.  Learned a lot about the cable industry.  Very busy work place.
bad,"A typical day at work includes answering calls, following up with customers I was previously working with to setup/change services."
bad,"This company didnt care about its employee at all "
bad,Call Center Manager/ i worked aroudn the clocked base don needs of te business that day/ the hardest part of the job was ensuring the that the policies were followed considering they continued to change regularly/ I enjoyed the relationships I built with some of the employees
bad,It was a call center job with a few hundred rep. no comment on my work experience there. It was a job
bad,"All calls go to sales agents, despite if the customer is calling to complain or cancel because you are expected to sell to ALL customers. Very rough on associates and customers and wastes time selling to customers who actually want service."
bad,Its a good place to work with and good environment where everyone lives with good medical and all benefits and facility to be imposed keeping a good and better evironment to work with.
bad,"the company is ok to work for if stability is not what your after, they have a high standard of metrics but if you can get good metrics then you will have a great job for as long you need.i enjoyed working for them"
bad,The hardest partof the job working in customer service is dealing with extremly rude customers. I over came these challages by being calm polite and caring to the customers
bad,"Comcast was a fabulous place to work and overall a very good experience. I loved my job, management and my direct supervisors."
bad,"When I first started this job, I believed all things were possible. The perks were awesome, pay was ok. But there is no amount of money/perks that can make up for the mental/verbal abuse from customers."
bad,"I have no issue with comcast, a fabulous company. i love the products, the services, i can't complain about the company i work for. Benefits, and a bond between colleagues, but just long days."
bad,"Typical day at work, door knocking, meeting with potential customers, cold calling, fallow up calls, managing my funnel, meeting with referral partners."
bad,"Horrible customer service job. Micro managed. However,  I met a lot of life long friends and learned a lot about selling & customer service from ongoing training. When I started this job, I loved it. I was paid over 50,000/year but it changed drastically when I left my salary was almost cut in half for the same job."
bad,"I was working at Comcast for about three months but due to my military leave , they said that was a issue with them. They let me go due to attendance even though I provided the documentation of my orders for me to leave. On another note , the job is a script fest. You read off of a script and if you can't solve it , you are transferring the call elsewhere or sending a truck. Easy money but not challenging and career advancement took over a year to even hear the word promotion."
bad,Very poor management at the Merrillville Indiana location. Encourages unethical sales practices. Has no respect for employees. Very very hard to work for. All the employees at this location are miserable
bad,Working over 60 hours a week every single week. 12+ hours a day. Only $9 an hour with no proper training. Bad management that just wants the job done no matter what. They don't care about their employees.
bad,"it depends on the manager/ supervisor. i worked at the comcast in the west palm beach location, great manager/supervisor. my troubles began once i transferred to the boca raton office. that office is the worst experience i have ever had with and employer. they make rules and policy as they go and if you speak out, you become public emery number one."
bad,Comcast is a company that unfortunately only cares about the bottom dollar. Supervisor and Manager sometimes didn’t care if there was a thunderstorm you still had to complete the job even at your own safety.
bad,Benefits are good but management is horrible. NO professionalism and a lot of favoritism. Very black and white. They do not look at agents individual needs
bad,"There's so many things wrong with the company it's hard to know where to start. In training you are told that ""it takes a lot to get fired from telesales"" and that to get fired you would have to commit fraud or use profanity towards a customer. What they DON'T tell you is that you WILL get fired if you do not meet your sales goals for a consecutive two months or more. You're told in training that you will keep getting ""coaching"" or whatever help you need to succeed. That's the furthest thing from the truth. You'll get ""coaching"" but after three ""coaching"" sessions you will go to a final written where you will have two weeks to meet at least 80% of your goal before you are fired. If you manage to meet 80% of your goal in that sales cycle, you'll remain at a final. If during the next sales cycle you fail to meet exactly 80% of your goal, you will have two weeks before your fired. "
bad,I create this account to get out of my current situation I have a plan to do better. I feel the manager had to move away from the place I would cause the sup. There were cut throats and did not care for the well being of the tech. You could work 9-10hrs and only get a 1 hr lunch that's it and when it comes to metrics just a very unfair place to be
bad,"This Job is extremely stressful, they only care about you making your goal, they do not take approach to the underlining issuse which is their terrible employees that they hire. All they do is bully and put others down1"
bad,comcast gave me anxiety it wasn't a good fit the customers are rude the employers are rude i was only got $8hr management was bad the hardest part of this job as the customers
bad,This company doesn't look out for their staff.  They make you work long hours and are know to outsource your job to contractors.  They are supposed to give you an hour lunch and sometimes you are lucky to see 15 minutes.
bad,I work in the call center. I have to clock in and adhere to a break schedule and be monitored constantly for all my actions.
bad,"No comprehensive management, stressful environment and counter-productive culture."
bad,"This company is greedy and only wants money. They give you a bonus every 3 months but it is taxed soo much don't know get much in the end. They want you to sell but there services are sooo high, all the customers want to do is downgrade. They want you to lie about a promo rate that will shoot up $60 in 6-12 months.They only give youa raise once a year. Start off at $10.50 in training. $11.00 and now $11.22. That's bs and as a CAE you can only max out a $14.00. You will be there forever trying to get that little money."
bad,sales person
bad,My typical day at Comcast was very interesting and at time educational. I enjoyed working with different people and learning new interesting things. Sometimes the hardest part were some customers who wanted to be difficult when it came to understanding how their bill extremely high when they had not made a payment. I would say the enjoyable times at work would be times when the company would have employee events or receiving recognition for a job well done.
bad,"This is a temp job. This is not a career, despite what HR advocates. I would not recommand this job to anyone. I truely disliked my time working for Comcast. First, the customer service/general service is terrible in alot of places. I would have to call current customers to sell products, why should we have to sell customers items, when their services do not work. Second, the pay is terrible. Telesales makes the company the most money and they get paid the least amount of money. Third, the rates are too high for the products. I give this job four thumbs down."
bad,"HR Management are unreliable and misleading. Pay below average , set unrealistic goals, promise you $80,000 a year buy don't mention you better work 7 days a week to get it."
bad,"Lack of growth opportunties, mentoring and or training. Not fairly paid for the work that is done. Kpi's change sometimes weekly which make it hard to be succesful."
bad,"I worked at Comcast for 4 years. I was publicly harassed and humiliated racially in a team meeting with zero help from my supervisor. HR told me I had a ""sensitivity"" and my scarring experience was swept under the rug. "
bad,"The great thing about Comcast is their products are amazing. And one nice perk of the job is the employee discount. "
bad,of job performance. It becomes painfully obvious who management deems these people to be even though job performance might dictate differently. I would not recommend working here. it's too much for free cable.
bad,With the current culture at my office the moral has been going down hill. Management seems more interested in pinching pennies than addressing the problems and concerns of techs
bad,I don't think comcast has a grip on reality as far as training goes. I am trying to retire from comcast if I can find the right fit. I have worked at comcast for 3 years.
bad,"Comcast's products and services are great. However, They do not treat their employees fairly. Some Managers do not know how to help their employees. The atmosphere feels like you are in high school. Customers hate the company so much that they treat the employees like garbage."
bad,"The job is a sales job. Plain and simple. And your priorities change at a drop of a hat. Also they will change your pay structure mid stream that prevents you from making a living. Their whole goal is to gouge the customer and not get fined by the FCC. They treat the workers like chattel and don't fall for the line that its a great place to work. Maybe in corporate, but not in the call centers."
bad,Your are micromanaged - management is very childish if you do not basically suck up to them you wont go anywhere further in the company which they make sure of. - Work place culture is not pleasant.
bad,"I was not impressed. there was no career advancement and they changed your job title and responsibilities at any time, including schedule. I would not recommend a friend."
bad,Lack of management being consistent .  Always wanting to try new things when the current way is/was better - Just for the sake of changing things. I would NEVER recommend working there for any length of time.
bad,Great for hardworking desperate young men. Pay is low compared to competitors but they try to justify it with free cable. Free cable is only beneficial for those who watch tons of tv. They care less about frontline employees while also shipping domestic call center jobs overseas.
bad,"They expect their sales force to go knocking door to door to find new customers.  Most of the time they would find customers that already owed them money, non-existent addresses, or customers that require deposit."
bad,Egoist and absorbed by titles. Mandatory overtime and leaders are verbally abusive. Pay is not commensurate to skill set and ability.  Team building and trust is discouraged.
bad,"Just back to back bull ish. Don't think that you have friends, or management cause you don't,  and everything that you learn in training is lies. Ouh yea and the c in com cast stands for constant change. Cause that all that happens. No job security and any chance they get they will dump it all on you."
bad,"Worked door to door, selling packages and deals for comcast, was very difficult to make money because was not paid based salary only paid off of sales that were made"
bad,Comcast bought out Time Warner which big changes were made especially in pay. New management brought in which changed the whole dynamics. It then became a not so fun place to work due to micromanage.
bad,Ok workplace but upper management isn't helpful and doesn't provide much job security. I worked for a company that was acquired by Comcast. There wasn't anyone and HR and this created multiple issues.
bad,"frustrating talking to customer who dislike the company. Stressful, under appreciated. My Supervisor retaliated against me and caused me to lose my job."
bad,"A typical day at work is filled with equipment shortages, incomplete or complete inaccurate work orders, which usually leads to a tech arriving at a disgruntle customer's home.  I enjoy working with the public and providing a service which leave my customers satisfied.  Communication between customer service and the customer needs improvement ."
bad,For the first year or two I truly enjoyed the work I did. However as years went by procedure and people changed. Management changed and out sourcing became the main process for the company. I was in line for a leadership position until the company went national and decided to change everything around to make it impossible to achieve their leadership standards. It was impossible to get promoted or move to another department.
bad,"Location is too far. Mostly black young people working there. There are only 2 shifts and both shifts are only 4.5 hours long. Public transportation is not reliable. Compensation is very low, they try to raise it every year to get more people to work for them. They have a very high turn over rate and the reputation of the company makes it hard to sell their products."
bad,My responsibilities were to listen to archived complaints from existing Comcast customers pertaining to On Demand. Once I investigated the complaint I would follow up with the customers and let them know what my findings were.
bad,A national company that started from nothing and has amassed a great fortune.  The management team(s) runs the business as if the technicians are children who need to be taught responsibility.  Most technicians enjoy the opportunity of meeting different people and providing assistance via installation and or troubleshooting.  I received high accolades for my brief tour of service yet was treated like a menial at the same time.  They should focus on worker appreciation which will enhance customer service experience.  An enlightened and focused employee solidifies the workplace.
bad,"Although Comcast prides themselves for being the #1 cable provider, this is not a great place to work.  Compensation and benefits are well below market averages.  The shift process is completely unrealistic and they have no integrity."
bad,Long days talking to customers attempting to cancel Comcast service trying to overcome objections to save your comission gets played out no work life balance at all once here consider your personal life gone
bad,That's about all I'll say about them. Good benefits. I don't have anything else I want to say regarding working for this company. Indeed required me to write.
bad,Nothing to say
bad,"With a company this big with as many moving parts... it is hard to imagine anyone really being heard.   CMOA is a management tool... and as such they will put you on  a ""plan"" which is a polite way of showing you the door.  It is for sure a churn and burn atmosphere with no long term employees beyond three years."
bad,The company itself is ok. However if you work in the peoria area expect to be highly overworked and majorly underpaid. Here they micromanage and they head hunt.. your job is never safe so many people have left due to this areas management. They also talk down to you and make you feel worthless. If you are close to getting a raise they find a reason to write you up. Comcast is ok peoria not so much.
bad,"Long days "
bad,"If you ever want to actually have a chance for career advancement beyond simply bouncing between menial roles at Comcast you either have to be a ""yes"" man/woman or you do not start in a position that is at all related to the Customer Care end of things. The Enterprise and Managed Enterprise Services Engineer roles have been reduced to a call center-esque environment where technical skills are not valued. If you just need a job and are fine with pay below the average for the job type, it is not the worst place in the world to work, but it often feels like Comcast is vying for that position."
bad,"Their culture doesn’t promote work life balance. It is more like a high school clique than a place of business. While I’m thankful to have it on my resume, I’m even happier have moved on"
bad,"I used to love going into work every day when I started Comcast, however once everything started getting centralized when the CEO from AOL was hired, the work environment changed. It now feels as an employee that I am a number instead of a person. The other problem is advancement as I am considered an expert in my department and needed in a lot of ways so I am told, and have tried to apply to other positions and I am not getting even an interview and have no reason not to as my job performance is on par, and the jobs meet or exceed my skill set. Advancement is important or being able to learn new parts to the company for me, and I can't even do that as it feels I'm being held back!"
bad,New management took over and didn't take the time out to find out how things were done they then started making changes that negatively affected the employees. The employees were only informed of the changes after issues where bought to up managements attention.
bad,"If you like to be constantly under scrutiny over the smallest margins of error, this is the place to work! Where Supervisor and Managers have nothing better to do than micromanage their employees even after years of proving their competence at their job! Job sucks, and this is coming from someone who was lauded as one of the best agents in his position. The management can't get their heads out of their bums."
bad,"Manager was not skilled in project management and it made working with them beyond difficult. Vague direction, minimal face time, poor time management. Tried to push me into being a graphic designer, which was never in my job description. Wasted so many hours having to relearn Photoshop that it ate up my writing time and focus. Manager would smile to my face and praise my work, but apparently was bashing me behind my back when direction she gave me wasn't well received by upper management. I enjoyed the rest of the work I did and the other employees I worked with, but apparently having a can-do attitude, making calls on my own when she wasn't responsive, and taking work home with me to meet deadlines wasn't enough to make manager happy."
bad,Unfocused management gives little or no support.  Difficult to know what to do on a daily basis. The people were nice but that doesn't say much for the overall culture of advancement.
bad,"I like to be open & honest. This job is very stressful! Having great co-workers who can keep you laughing is the only factor that helps get you through your shift. The pay is ok, at best. It really depends on what you have going on outside of work. I used to work for a competitor before coming to Comcast (just wanting to try call center life) and I should have stayed where I was at. These customers are rude, and don't let the customer request a supervisor...GOOD LUCK! you can de-escalate all you can and they STILL wont back you up. The call volume is high & you will be taking back to back calls the entire shift. the workplace culture...a-lot of favoritism is shown. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually making it through your shift and going home. The hardest part of the job is keeping your sanity and going home WITHOUT a headache every day. Why am I still there you ask, oh don't worry, I'm applying elsewhere and only been there less than 6 months sooo yea, TIME TO GO.  For a company the size of Comcast and the stuff we have to go through, we do not get paid enough, and management will through it back in your face ""no other company pays as much as Comcast"" ummmm $12/hr  is NOTHING!"
bad,"Work there to find out. Not really room for advancement. I don't have much to say about the company.  If you like free cable/internet, then it is the place for you."
bad,"A typical day at work was difficult and extremely challenging. I learned that it takes a focused mind and a healthy fit body to perform at the rate to which the company demanded. The workplace culture was intense and stressful at times. This was, in fact, the hardest part of the job."
bad,"As a install technician you are paid less then what you should actually be receiving while the company expects you to just go where they want without question. A typical Day at work will almost always be longer then your 10hr shift due to their failure to set a standard in their scheduling. Every time frame is double booked and if you ever complain about how your drive home is longer then 2 hrs they will not work with you. Went a year and multiple conversations with the higher ups and they did nothing but end up trying to turn it back onto the technician."
bad,"Comcast is an amazing company that is consistently evolving. They really care about their customers but they seem to neglect their employees. The environment is highly stressful. With the rate that they evolve, things constantly change. Then when you learn that method they change it again. The scheduling is not flexible if you have a family. The benefits are great but for everything you do the pay is not nearly enough."
bad,"Comcast is a company that eats their own young. I was there a week and was left to figure out everything on my own with no help on learning the programs and what was k and not. I worked there 4 years and with a new manager they decided they no longer needed myself or my co-worker that had been there 14 years, Very dirty company to work for never trust them!"
bad,Door to door sales was very demanding. The position was ONLY about money. The training did not match the environment we had to sell in. You had to adapt on the fly and motivate yourself.
bad,as a former employee who had been on the track of promotion do honestly want to say. We aren't empowered to actually give an experience to our customer. More to curate the skew perspective that all of the services we offer are needed in other peoples lives for commission. Its an odd role where morals conflict how much you allow a customer to save on their bill and how much commission your home needs to sustain. 
bad,I was taught if I don't have anything nice to say then to be silent. I have a lot of mixed emotions about the management and overall environment with this employer.
bad,"Once you go to work here you find out very fast no one will have your back from your work mates on up to management, considering the extremely low starting pay with very little to no chance for upward movement I could not recommend this as a place to work at all."
bad,"No work life balance, stressful with customer calling and cursing you out all the time. Supervisors are lazy and don't want to assist. There are a couple great supervisors but so many are lazy."
bad,"It was great at first then throughout the year alot of things changed including commission and the management is not great at all but the benefits are great , no complain on that part !"
bad,Used to be this job was all about sales and less about customer service. That has flipped and the upper management wants to turn this job into a low=wage job. My immediate supervisor was great but upper management is constantly finding ways to lower commissions.
bad,"Work environment was great in the beginning however over 12 months there were no stable management other than the Best ASM that was promoted out of store and left 1 senior agent that was promoted to ASM that was the best acting manager until personal LOA. Since, Every 6 months there would be a different manager. Managers would quit, too much work and responsibility. The staff is great, but very poor training follow up and  a lot of pressure to meet daily goals, short staffed, warehouse stocking and no daily breaks allowed without approval by a manager. If goals are not met it is a disciplinary action. Most recent mandatory Saturday training for not reaching sales goals. Demeaning management style if you have not met goals, point system deduction fornlate or sick calls seem to be always communicated by ASM. Repeat New Managment and Philosophy of hiring from Best Buy does not work. The pay was fair but you have to work and sell core business and not lower customers bundle price without being penalized on your sales. The hours were more flexible if you're part-time but never set and flex weekly. A lot of pressure from customers and If you can deal with constant yelling customers with no management presence or support and keep in professional then this is the place for you."
bad,"The Management plays politics, no clue of what direction they want o go "
bad,The hardest part of this job is the ability to help customers in distress.  Comcast reaps all benefits without care or responsibility to its customers.
bad,"Avoid this company at all costs. Typical day included hostile customers, getting chased by dogs, getting chased by gang members, dealing with defective company equipment, poor management, lack of leadership and unsafe working conditions to say the least."
bad,Terrible work life balance. The company has steered away from M-F day shifts and career advancement has become nearly impossible. Job postings are almost always spoken for leaving no opportunity for advancement. Favortism is rampant.
bad,its a cool job something to do with no one over your back as long as your doing work correct but im a family guy an doing this will take all that away for one you only get off on weds no other day but that day they dont show pay rates took them for ever to get them out oh an to take off you need to give a 14 day notice
bad,Job was very demanding. Mandatory overtime caused a lot of hardships and made it difficult to do the job. Worked all holidays.Hard for a single mom or for anyone who has a family.
bad,"pay is minimal and doesn't compete with market standards.  Too many rules that make the work environment unpleasant. work shift is changes too often with little  warning which can be disruptive to lifestyle.  main perks is the discounted on services such as internet and cable,"
bad,I found for the time i worked there to be a very stressful place.  they micro-manage you always being watched and listened to and there is no talking to one another
bad,"the majority of the customers complain, most try to get out of paying their bills, and the one who deserve an adjust management justifies not giving credit. A lot of times supervisors will tell customers they will give an adjust but never apply it, then the customer will call back frustrated."
bad,"Comcast is a overall a great company to work for, but the Telesales department is not worth the headache. The company wants us to offer current customers upgraded services meaning if they have basic cable which is costing them $20 (the only thing they can afford) a month, they then want us to offer them services which are $170 a month. On top of that the services do not work and customer service is horrible which make customers want to cancel their services. Also, the company offers $8 per sale but if the customer cancels their services in 120 of activation then the company will go in your future checks and start taking back those commission checks. DO NOT WORK IN THE TELESALES DEPARTMENT. Your check will never see $400 and plus they tax your $8 commission."
bad,good job - great benefits - horrible management in the Sarasota office - overall a great opportunity - they do give almost free services to their employees
bad,"This job is hyped up to seem as though the only calls you get during an inbound shift is ""sales calls"", which is the furthest thing from the truth. There is a new training class every month for the same position. It's sink or swim. The average person last 4-7 months."
bad,Comcast was a fun place to work but the hours were horrible they paid very little made it a drag to come into work I hated walking in everyday knowing I'm going to get abused by the customers
bad,"Comcast allowed their senior level management to be very threatening towards employees and made their employees play the political role to further advancement instead of looking at results, it was very unmotivating."
bad,"ever call Comcast for help ? now try to call them several times a day, everyday ? They have the most overly complex system in place and know it.Whats worse is there is no plan to ever make it better."
bad,Not fun at all. They overwork you. And they under pay there workers. Some of the Supervisors give no support to the Technicians out in the field. When a Supervisor is requested buy a customer they are never available.
bad,"Management is out of touch with what calls are coming into their call centers. Daily outages are always coming in from certain regions of the country. Why won't management improve there infrastructure."
bad,I am declining to provide a statement at this time. I currently work there and thankful for the opportunity. I am keeping my options open.
bad,"Trainer impersonal and not knowledgeable. "
bad,"I've been working for Comcast for 4-years, and if you want to make money, and be less-than-abused, stressed, and valued? Than you need to look elsewhere. In 4-years, I have been (honored by?) less-than $3 in raises. They start low, and you will keep making low-wages. They would rather spend money on trying to talk employees out-of joining unions."
bad,The benefits and free cable are great. The front line employees are knowledgeable and fun to work with. Management leaves something to be desired. Hard work and being a top performer almost gets you no where unless you are good at politics within the organization.
bad,Dont go there!!!!!!!!!!1 horrible experience. checks dont be right and the managers have very rude attitudes.unorganized and unprofessional. money is low paying and the environment is uncomfortable.
bad,"This place should be dubbed HELLcast I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy!  I am in no way afraid of hard work I love a challenge, I often received awards, and earned top rankings in the center.  I was more then qualified for any position every team I was set with I excelled my fellow team mates ALWAYS looked to me for help since I grasp very quickly and you have to be the training is always mediocre and half done, they got rid of the leaders that would care and stand up for employees and fight to get them recognition which would forever leave you in the same position no matter how much you proved you were so much better.  This place is not for anyone and after working there the values the company REALLY has will show and show quickly this place is there for nothing but money which okay I understand they have to survive but they are always looking for ways to make more no matter what affect it has on the LOYAL customers after they told us sale sale sale and NEVER lower a bill period not even for the ones that have been with the company for years they care about nothing more then a bottom line everyone that doesn't contribute to that is expendable.  This job taught me nothing but anger and how to undercut. To me there was nothing to hard about the job again I was a perfect fit excellent in every way excelled in sales and leadership, but for 3 years sat in the same position never to advance."
bad,"The job itself is not bad but the management that runs the job is very unorganized and favoritism is involved. "
bad,I wouldn't refer a friend to this company because its not employee friendly.
bad,I'm pretty sure a room full of 5 year olds could run that office better.  Very poorly managed.  Very discriminate.  No one is ever on the same page about policies and procedures.  You're a number and not a person.
bad,"Was promised a schedule to accommodate life outside of work, but was never delivered. As our responsibilities and duties were increased, our pay remained the same. Raises were seldom and minuscule."
bad,They raffle tickets to pro events when they are available.  We have summer outings and winter (holiday) parties.  The people are friendly and the environment is very laid back.
bad,"THEY SUCK! They do not care about their employees or their well being. They will work you until you get sick and then not want to pay you. Sonetimes their payroll messed up my check and I didn't get paid, I was told I had to wait until next pay period as part of their process. Nobody works for 4 weeks straight without a check! Locations vary, but whatever you do RUN from the TINLEY PARK location. It is a ZOO!"
bad,"I was told when a customer was very upset to just let him go, we have millions of customers. Comcast truly believes that customers will come back regardless of inept customer service practices."
bad,"A typical work day would consist of my arrival, 15min to prep and prepare for my day and taking on up to +80 calls on a daily basis. Handling customer issues and directing customers to proper channels concerning issues outside of billing. What I learned from the experience is making the best out of a bad situation. While I felt comfortable knowing management had held the billing rep position before, I felt a lack of support in certain situations. Great mix of long term and short term co-workers with the company made for a chance to learn and understand what was effective for the position. The hardest part of the job was the pay/schedule. The work and sense of accomplishment handling customer issues was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"Required to work 60+ Hrs week and management is horrible. No room for advancedment, benefits are awful. Have to work 60 days before you even quailify for insurance."
bad,no good to work treat people lke slaves noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
bad,"You would spend hours in the sun, rain and snow selling or trying to upsell your customers on the product, sometimes you would get dropped of in a secluded area with just yourself and no way out and unless you sold a product you wouldnt get paid"
bad,Customer service can be rewarding as well as stressful. At the end of the day you have to ask yourself are you blessed? I was thankful everyday to have job that offered benefits and and a clean and safe environment.
bad,"I started in cable working for a different company that was bought out by Comcast. That company had great benefits took care of their people and generally made you feel appreciated. When Comcast came in that all changed, gone were the appreciation dinners and the holiday extras, granted the pay increased because they were a bigger company they could afford the increase but we paid for it indefinitely. Our union was subverted by new employees who only worked there long enough to vote the union out then quit, after that everything hit the fan. Now good people who knew their job and have been doing it loyally for 10 yrs or more were being canned for not getting enough units done in a day, even though the company doesn't allow for enough units to complete certain jobs. I transferred departments to a indoors center thinking that it would be different and it was for a short time. Our director was canned for not wanting to ""work us till we bleed"" and replaced with one off the streets who had no respect for the average employee, then she was let go once production numbers fell, go figure. The last director I worked with came in making all types of promises and over the course of 2 years did not fulfill one of them. Soon enough my troubleshooting department was dissolved since they wanted to make the center into a retention center and we were offered a re-skill training that was laughable, just horrible (making posters and coming up with slogans is not helpful training for retention, maybe marketing but not retention). I eventually found out that retention is not about keeping the customer"
bad,I would not refer anyone to work for the Madison ASC for Comcast.
bad,Comcast has an excellent work enviroment but very slim chance for advancement
bad,"horrible place to work for,fast paced,no time for breaks,supervisors are slave drivers,low pay,no advancement."
bad,"Company has no loyalty to employees, no family feeling to belong to an organization, they push on employees til they push you out, and the way to keep a job as field tech is play the disability game, because you will need time away. Good Luck, it is a job to make money."
bad,I learned a lot of customer service and how to react to people and resolve many different issues in a calm matter
bad,"Check runs, supervise four people."
bad,a typical day at work can be stress at sometimes what i learned ever let a job stress you out take it day by day..and customer are first.management to me did not really care about people.co-workers were helpful at sometimes. we needed the hardest was part of the job to talk to customers. help the customer solve there problems with they cable
bad,Call center role is all related to raising revenue for the company and not providing quality customer care. It was obvious when 90% were to complain about the terrible customer service - there is a problem with treating the customers with respect.
bad,"I typical day at work was starting at 8:30 a.m. and you would finish at 7:00 p.m. I learned how to install cable boxes, modems, wireless devices. the hardest part of the job you were always on the run, you never had a chance to sit down and relax. The most enjoyable part of the job was to install cable t.v. and see the customer happy."
bad,The company I work for is a sub contractor service thru comcast the company can do better for there employes but they dont
bad,"Wow. Let me see... I worked there for 5 years. I came in with the understanding that I wanted one job, and that I would be able to advance in that position after awhile. I was there a onth when that job opened up. They passed over me, and held that jobover my head for my entire tenure, finally telling me there was a ""personality conflict"" and I would never get it. Odd, since I got along with everyone there... with the exception of one lady who came into our dept, where we were all friends, and made everyone's life a living he^&. She finally quit, and then did the same to another dept. She ultimately had to get a job as a realtor, bc no other place could stand her for very long and she had no experience to use for another position. Also, the manager was horrible. He would schedule a particular job to where on a Friday, I was doing three days of work (we worked a day ahead, so we did the weekend and Monday's work on Friday) The job had very demanding standards, where you were entering series' of numbers that corresponded with clients. If you messed up, the wrong client got billed. On a Friday, because of the scheduling, I would LITERALLY work a 19-21 hour day, and if I made a single mistake, I would be written up. I was once written up after personally saving the company $75000.. over something someone else did. I was also written up based on a sales person's accusation. This manager did a ""thorough"" investigation, wrote me up... and I went back to my desk and found the paperwork that exonerated me. SO much for being ""thorough"" if you don't even ask the person you're accusing"
bad,was let go because spouse was in/out of hospital & my attendance suffered. Even with me providing documented proof of her stays
bad,"Sales position was MORE than sales; which metrics are not as realisitic when coupled with realm of ""taking care of customers''. The pay is ot nearly what was first informed. It turned to be $4 less."
bad,"I worked there successfully for 15 years, brought on new accounts grew them and after a certain level they would take them away and give them to someone else. Upper managers don’t care about reps. They say they do but. saying and showing are 2 different things. You can be loyal to a company but. Most of these companies are not reciprocal. Knowing this go learn and leave. I now work for myself!"
bad,ok place to work...need more work/life balance.  Theres potential to make a lot of money if you are diligent and keep working toward it and can sit in your seat.
bad,If your good at sales and want to make a good amount of money but are also willing to sacrifice a social life and your mental health due to management and HR not willing to do the right thing by there employees then this is the job for you.
bad,They don't give raises and they cap your hourly. They find ways to block your commission structure you will work 3 times as hard for the 3rd of what you make for them.
bad,Do yourself a favor and stay away from the XSA job! The company has good benefits though. Find a different department. It is very hard to move within the company.
bad,Comcast is always on constant change. pay has been cut by near 50 percent. micro management is big. its never enough. it always seems like they want something more once one thing is achieved
bad,"Fortune 50 obsessed with inundating Customers with new gadgets , apps and online services while overcharging and neglecting to upgrade obsolete plant."
bad,Call center job centers around selling multiple products in a small amount of time. Paid less than $15 an hour after 3 years of working for this company.
bad,"Nothing has really changed since Comcast was voted the worst company in America.  It is truly a cult of completely fake, disingenuous, unconscious personalities.  I should have taken it as an insult that they hired me to be one of them."
bad,"I worked there for 6 years and it was awesome the first three years I worked there ! Then they stopped caring about the employees and only focused on making sales and making the company more money ! I cared about my customers and co workers, but management and the director does not !! Be prepared to sell xfinity video, Internet, voice , phone , and Mobile on 1 call! So the $23.00 they are advertising is possible , but you will work for it !! Very stressful and the supervisors are not helpful and give you a lot wrong information, because they are to lazy to get the right answer ! Not a good experience! They show favoritism and do not like it when you more knowledge than they are ! This should be your last choice of a place to work !! Unless you are looking for a short job !"
bad,takes advantage of people in order to make money and instead of letting their employees solve the customers problems pushes the employee to the next job.
bad,"A few years ago this company was amazing! Once the owner died everything great about the company went to the grave with him. Horrible Management, bogus commission goals, favoritism and hiring up from outside of the company. This place is now trash.com"
bad,"i will say from a consumer standpoint, my services were not A1. i constantly had issues with the services from my internet and cable. they trick you into the bundle deals but once you do that theres no way out. decreasing services cost you more, and increases services are only good for a period of time. now on the other hand working as an agent, far much worse. the benefits, the tricks the scams, the constand run around dealing with customers because they depend on someone to do their job is just ridiculous."
bad,"Employees stealing from one another, terrible management at the district, regional and national levels.  You just get desensitized by customers yelling at you all the time.  Don't waste your time unless you really really really need a job."
bad,It is not a fun place to work. There is no job security. The management  does not reward technical excellence and risk taking. There is not much growth opportunity in the company. Organizational politics dictates who will be promoted in the job.The company still has difficulty assimilating the various small companies that it has acquired.
bad,"Work life balance is horrible, constant shift changes this is not recommended  for parents. Very stressful and unorganized. This is large company that operates like a small business.  Favoritism and retaliation are the norm."
bad,"A typical day of work would be clocking in and start taking calls from minute 0, the supervisors would be on you for being 1 minute late from break or lunch, they would even ask why you got off the phones when it wasnt your break or lunch.Management was horrible, I mean they all looked out for themselves."
bad,"I had a horrible supervisor. All he cared about was stats. It has been said that people do not quit the job, they quit management. Overall, it was a call center that was very catty."
bad,Comcast has been great company overall to work for but it currently operate under analytic approach to management. Compensation over employees concerns or consideration is preferred.
bad,"Lack of accountability across cross-functional teams.  Working environment is stressful, due to the lack of processes and limited tools to manage workload"
bad,"They make the stats hard to maintain, contently changing how calls should go. Pretty much reading from script, always holding you accountable for things out of your control. Such as when a customer calls in and doesn't choose to take the survey before the call, agent is scored on that even though it isn't in the agents control. On top of this the customers are not all friendly, and when you are unable to help them due to limited ability. Plus if you need any type of help the supervisors and managers really are not there to help. They pretty much are there to watch us. If you became sick or unable to work their short term disability company they hired is horrible and will not pay and will make your recovery harder to deal with."
bad,No communication and lack of advancing. They have on achievable goals. Other departments cause issues in our department but the technician is always responsible for everybody else’s mistakes. They don’t open other opportunities for advancement very often.
bad,"When I originally got hired, I was extremely excited, Finally a good job. During training the job and pay was great. After training, the pay dropped to $12 an hour, which was a huge hit. They do pay commission, however it can be difficult to reach all the numbers right after training. The pay is nowhere near where it should be for the work you do."
bad,I honed my customer service skills and computer abilities in this position. I didn't feel comfortable selling new services to customers who were already unhappy with their bill. I did learn a lot about equipment and cable services.
bad,"Almost everything is done as a response rather than as a plan, so overall work is poorly organized and unnecessarily hectic. People use the word, ""fast-paced"" to describe the environment, but I've worked in successful, fast-paced environments where teams are setup for success. At Comcast, the team is not setup for success; they're setup to work responsively and this does not seem like they see this as an issue."
bad,"Management puts way too much pressure to perform job functions."
bad,I worked for Comcast many years and was able to make an average salary to take care of a family. It was very challenging trying to move up and if you are looking for a company to get a steady pay check Comcast is the place to make a decent living.
bad,"Metrics driven.  alot of favorites here, only promote those they want. very stressful. hard to change departments.  Alot of favoratism.  people leave left and right after figuring how it is here. it is all about a scorecard which is incorrect alot of the time. system issues, poor management."
bad,"From day one, the message from senior leadership to junior leaders is ""move people out of the business."" Rarely, is emphasis on building up standouts."
bad,"Worked at the Business Service Call Center in Horsham, PA. The wok environment is incredibly stressful, you are essentially going there for the metrics and not the customers. Comcast has very little regard for their customers and are consistently ranked very low on customer service. The products and service is very cheap and unreliable. They are anything but built for business."
bad,"the job would change weekly, every week or two the management would change the the daily roles of what and how to do your job. customers were told inconstant stories based on whom they spoke with,"
bad,"The stress comes from the supervisors and managers making many changes daily and being understaffed. I just wish the managers and supervisors would truly listen to employees in regards to the work load, to have a much better outcome daily. Like not overbooking technicians so we can truly make on time apportionments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts, co-workers and paid time off."
bad,a typical day will be you getting up at 530 am go to the warehouse and pick up equipment. shop closes at 8 am then meeting at 7 am head to your first job at 8 am till your done ..climb in attic temp about 130 deg . run wires then finish prewiring install equipment
bad,"Place is not clean, management was not the best, had to deal with rude customers with little help, training was 12 weeks and you leave with little knowledge, over all it is not professional like it claims to be."
bad,pay rate changes too much incentives started out good but got very bad.they sell the illusion  that the job is good but 1 bad call and they terminate the employee even though the worker has great ratings
bad,"Comcast isn't the best place to work, you never know if you'll have your job. Its post to be about the employee but its not. Customers are allowed to call in and abuse you with no worries."
bad,"Products are great "
bad,very poor customer service train was not informative for taking customer calls....sales was competitive but no displine for some taking your sales or your customers
bad,Horrible management  everyday new set of rules. Always had to find out rules through word of mouth. All managers would say something different to employees which would cause conflict within the job. The employees there are great people and help you in anyway possible love those people
bad,"It would be a shame and disaster to leave a good sales position from another company  Comcast business sales for a promise of higher income."
bad,No review will be forthcoming; nothing whatsoever to say regarding this company or its employment; I do not wish to comment at all regarding my time with this place.
bad,"Comcast used to be a great company to work for until they began cutting commissions by 30% every 6 months. Culture changed, union speak was going around, and top talent went elsewhere."
bad,just ajob until something else comes along!! Don't care about their employees your just a number . Your reminded constantly about the consequences of not making your numbers everyday.Sress level is terrible and management is horrible!!
bad,"Stressful, under paid. No one know what they are doing not even management. Atleast 5 sups lrft in 2 months and right before I left 14 people walked. Before the start of 2017 15 people quit and the number grows everday. Training was a nightmare and we had to rely on one another  to get by."
bad,"They do not listen to their employees even when obvious that changes need to be made.  Additionally, if taking leave of absence for medical reasons, they do not explain benefits and that they may not pay you.  Employee be ware.  It's all about the company."
bad,Company nightmare. You're going to be abused by the customer because of the company ripping them off. Then the company dares you to react so to fire you. High job turn over horrible place to work
bad,At the time it was hard to keep this job.  It was all about the numbers and if you didnt bring in the numbers then you were not fit to do the job.  The benefits were excellent and you got to have their products for free.  But I dont like being micromanaged.
bad,"the job is too stressful and they don't pay you enough for the amount of work, management sucks and very little advancement chance"
bad,This job isn't one I would recommend for a rest of your life but it is good with getting extra cash and extra experience. You start part time and they decide where they need you so you will either be on blast(internet) or upgrade.
bad,Fast paced work environment very competitive. Daily goals and requirements set in place to achieve. This job is a business that you have to maintain with good organization skills.
bad,"Manager was poor at disseminating strategic information  only task oriented. Do the task, you don't really need to know why mentality. Overtime Work not really appreciated."
bad,It started out as a great company to be employed for but the position i was in required me to have a business phone that customers could call. customers didnt seem to respect hours and the fact that i can't do everything.
bad,bad management and inconsistent pay asked to do jobs other than sales. but only get paid when you make sales. on a monthly basis comp plan is restructured but goes down and makes company more and employees less
bad,The navy had questionable leadership. Most of the superiors chose criticism and disrespect as a form of motivation. Besides that the balance between work life and home wasn't too desirable. And while you have benefits the medical facilities usually diagnose you with wrong illnesses if they even treat you at all.
bad,"Not a very good place to work, almost like joining the good old boys. You really have to quit and come back to work for Comcast in order to get promoted."
bad,"pay is way under what it should be for a living wage in this area stoker jobs for king soopers pay better. "
bad,"The company is a mixture of good and bad management. Unfortunately the bad leadership bullies and charms at their discretion, so they survive almost forever. The bad management easily over power the good ones for self interest. The bad leaders create a toxic environment in their department and infects any other departments they have any cross functional work with. This is part of their customer service problem at a core level. One bad director can kill the morale and motivation of a thousand employees, both directly and indirectly."
bad,"Team managers are racist and biased towards men."
bad,The company cares more about their money than employees and customers.management doesn't listen to ideas or team members.
bad,"help customers with my great customer services skills, took customer orders, set up install dates and times. Fix account issues and troubleshoot! i loved my co-workers and enjoyed the job, but after 2 years, I would like to work with customers face to face and have an opportunity for advancement. Being on the phone 10 hours a day was getting to me and I wanted to have more responsibility."
bad,"Every complaint a customer has an employee has it 10 times worse. The company does not care about you, at all! You could be the best at what you do, it doesn't matter."
bad,Comcast Retention department is generally always changing policies and it's not really a place to consider a long-term career. Comcast retention department is too unstable and job security is always in question.
bad,"Is all about the numbers no life no consideration for the years of service a typical day for a manager starts at 7 am and still at 7:30 pm you are still pulling reports or answering calls from the call centers to techs and VP, the hardest part of the job is to wait from your boss with no expectations to where to go next the leadership is very poor"
bad,"hard job in a call center, worked from home answering phones for customers and selling products for the company along with upselling existing customers."
bad,"I took calls for people that were having issues with their boxes and/or accounts. I was what they call a tier 1 tech, I did all the basic troubleshooting and sent signals to the affected areas to see what was wrong with a cable box. "
bad,"Micro-management at it's finest.  Regular beatdowns if you're not making sales.  Working outside in the winter, in the dark...dangerous.  Training is good.  Pay is great if you're hitting your numbers.  Close to free cable, internet and phone.  Great health benefits.  Keep track of your sales and pay.  Otherwise, you'll lose it.  Unattainable quota numbers unless you get lucky once in a while.  Fellow employees will steal a sale from you if they can.  Dwindling territories due to towns changing ordinances about door-to-door salespeople.  Potential customers won't buy due to price and poor customer service.  You can go weeks without a sale sometimes.  A lot of luck and timing involved.  Chargebacks if someone doesn't pay their bill."
bad,"It looks nice on the outside, but when you get down to it, Comcast is rotten fruit. You can learn a lot, if they allow you to branch out, but with the wrong manager, your experience can be a very bad experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the phony people who only got their jobs because of nepotism. The building is beautiful, but the facilities are a joke and there's over crowding. "
bad,"A typical day is non stop with the lobby full of customers waiting for you to wait on them.  They are angry and it is our job to fix what is wrong.  This job requires patience or a ""I don't care"" attitude."
bad,"Comcast only cares about Comcast, they pay decent and have good benefits but they could care less about employees. When I was hired they specifically stated ""We hire to retire.."" meaning when one is hired they would end up retiring with the company. Fast forward two years they are pulling out of the Mid-West and basically firing everyone."
bad,"relationship building"
bad,"Okay place, management was a bit standoffish. Coworkers were nice."
bad,"You had no support from management on any level, the only thing they care about is making them selves look good to their bosses"
bad,"Overall communication was threatening to all employees, High amount of turn around. Bad Morale"
bad,"my typical day starts at 7 and i start my route ,sometimes i get to my 1st job without being rerouted.my day consists of trouble shooting and installing cable and telephone.The hardest part of my job is climbing under houses and up on telphone poles in really bad weather.the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting great ppl and troubleshooting....."
bad,"Nothing good to say about this experience. A ""cube farm"" that Dilbert(tm) would be proud of."
bad,"A typical day would include taking between 50-60 calls assisting frustrate customers with technical support needs regarding their cable, phone and internet. Frustrated and overworked colleagues made the working environment very discouraging."
bad,Ok but sales suck the customers are rude and you are forced to tell customers lies to get them to buy the product
bad,"Overall an ok place to work,however,way too many managers."
bad,"Let me say this again, Comcast as a company was great to work for.  But the Outside Business Sales department was extremely unethical.  The management was caught giving out the best leads to a select few people.  They denied it for months and when enough people were expressing concerns, they admitted it.  I have also never worked so hard in my life for such little commission.  Whatever they tell you in the interview process, it IS NOT relationship selling.  They want a one call close every time.  Not all of the supervisors/management are bad.  I would not recommend this position to everyone."
bad,"Company is antiquated. The payment centers still use dot matrix printers. Customers are given the run around and no one wants to take accountability."
bad,"Did the job for the work, not much else to say, managed to make the best out of it while I was there. Decent work that fit my skills and interests for the time being."
bad,"Pay is about two dollars above the minimum wage here in Illinois, and at the same rate as McD's starts fry boys and girls except you get to sit down behind a computer. "
bad,"In the inception Comcast was a great opportunity.  Like most large companies the Corporate environment is dictated from an operational only point of view and not driven from a sales point of view.  Comcast has sound revenue streams outside of SMB which hides the down slope this department is on. Many obstacles have been put into place causing a diminishing return, high sales rep turn over, and Customer dissatisfaction.  "
bad,"not a very good place to work, having to worry about metrics everyday. Not knowing if you have a job the next day.."
bad,Okay place to work but no real opportunity for advancement or job security.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. They will bring you in with promises of advancement and raises, but the longer you stay, the more you will hate the place. Just another overly large corporation who cares nothing for its employees"
bad,The demans for sales are very high however we aare constantly calling the same customers over & over
bad,"productive but negative moral environment, unprofessionalism in management and no one wants to take ownership of issues employees are faced with. the hardest part of my job and allowed abuse from customers that I speak with and I am not always provided with the proper training nor tools to utilize in order to be sufficient and assisting customers. My co workers moral is low because of the pay rate and additional job duties that are constantly added to our work load with inadequate to to meet expectations. The most enjoyable part about my job are sales incentatives and my benefits such as flex time, vacation and bereavement. I have learned to be humble,patient, and detail oriented. I have also advanced my customer service and computer skills"
bad,"Disconnect of up to 60 people cable in a day, six days a week usually 10-12 hour days, majority on the pole which meant I carried a ladder. I also dealt with customers and excepted payments cash and credit"
bad,"The work enviornment is like being in a daily survivor game. The internal order process is very dysfunctional and inhibits the ability to get paid on closed orders. Customers are sold and closed but orders crash on the backend due to lack of sales support. And even though the rep has fully done a good job closing/selling, they are not paid on orders that are not processed. Most of the work day is spent on repetitive tasking, putting out admin super fires and not selling. Culture is somewhat oppressive and reps are held accountable for lost sales due to the company's inability to service the customer. Call center morale is usually low and management seems detached from what actually happens during the sales process. Very stressful work enviornment."
bad,A typical Day at work - Getting Cursed out.
bad,"The day at work is always different, but always enjoyable. You are always learning somthing new about work and yourself. The management is most often well informed, and most times pass along the information. The co-workers are a savage bunch, and wait for older personal to make misstakes so that they will bennefit. Working with cut throat co-workers. Not having someone looking over your shoulder, and knowing and feeling good about the job you did that day."
bad,"You do not have a life working for this company, its very demanding of your time. My co-workers however are wonderful but the management never seems to be very helpful, the hardest part of the job is the hours that have to be put in and the most enjoyable part is the customers."
bad,"Provide Customer Service, Arrange delivery schedules, Arrange merchandise display, Collect deposit or payment, Conduct sales presentations, Demonstrate goods or services,"
bad,"Comcast is a very fast paced and demanding sales environment. This position has brought me back to basic face to face sales, persuasive techniques and persistence. I love dealing with customers and have exceeded all goals by 150%"
bad,"This company works for is share holders, not it's customers."
bad,Comcast creates an environment for is sales representatives with metrics and products that you have to lie to customers in order to succeed. They teach a selling method that they require you to quote full price on one or two products in order to force the customer into a 3 product promotion. Dishonest business practices with a false claim to care about customers opinion make it a toxic work environment.
bad,"Comcast used to be a great place to work and protentional growth however, as the economy gets worse companies must restructure. Although Comcast has not lost money through the economic times they have chosen to eliminate hudreds of position across the country. The only way to grow with Comcast is if you are willing to relocate at your own expense to a different state. I would not recomment Comcast unless you are not wanting to grow in your career without relocating."
bad,"New management took over th call center, and started laying off individuals who had been there for 10 yrs plus. They fired 8 supervisors on the spot without any notice."
bad,"You work hard to move up and advance and then they eliminate your position , or offer you another position at a substantial pay cut . I won't even use their cable now ."
bad,As a CAE I was often hit with many unobtainable goals which strained my relationship with my immediate supervisor. I did not feel valued as a person by management.
bad,"The training for technicians is non-existent.  Basically if the online Premises Health Test passes with a green check mark, then swap the box.  If it fails with a red ""X"", figure out the cable problem. If you don't get it done quickly, dispatch is all over you, and your productivity metric suffers.  There are too many goals that determine your advancement or wage raises that are uncontrollable.  I could add so much.  What's the point?  Listen - if you're thinking of becoming a Comcast technician, my advice is to only pursue it if you're desperate."
bad,"Great products, and good benefits. Customer service is always an area that needs improvement. Too many cooks in the kitchen at times and implementations that aren't tested fully."
bad,"Too much favoritism. Weak middle mgmt. no transparency, several types of discrimination. Make many changes without true explanations. Not honest with employees."
bad,Terrible experience.  I would not recommend a call center position.  They just work you to death.  Very little time between calls.  In the interview they say 25 calls a day average.  It is more like 45 to 50.   The customers are all angry.  They have good reason because of the culture at Comcast.  It is all about the $$ not about the Customer.
bad,took a lot of calls and a lot of angry customers but i would manage to calm them down. it wasn't bad but it just wasn't for me. you do get satisfaction when they were really grateful
bad,Learned few things though did not have job security and work place freedom.  Management did not want any developers to interact.  They treated most of the visa dependent developers as slaves.
bad,"they do not work with there employee, supervisors hard to work with will not teach employee well not even in the school truck not being taken care of at all."
bad,The agents that make up your team are the reason to show up everyday. Ensuring to build a strong team environment. Management is the reason to not show up everyday. No support or leadership from management. The sales department is a meat grinder. Setup for failure instead of success with management blaming the supervisors for not hitting sales goals. The call que is anything but a sales que.
bad,"Comcast business is growing very slowly. They constantly looking at ways to get last penny out of you. But don’t feel bad. Everyone and every operation is fair game. When they don’t feel there is a need for your, your group, or whole division, you are out of door. It doesn’t matter how high you are.  Personally I know at least a dozen VPs were pushed out. Everyone is trying one up each other. No collaboration at all. Don’t go if you have options"
bad,Long hours and you never know when you will get off. Management was not always there when i needed them. Pay was okay but not for the amount of work that you are required to do
bad,I couldn't say much about Comcast since I was treated unfairly and they don't even have time to review or listen to every explanation. Not pretty much.
bad,"I worked for Comcast for a long time.  In general, working in Denver area was not so good.  They continue to change direction, and don't have an understanding of the work the DevOps team actually has to do on a daily basis.  "
bad,"comcast tech ops department is horrible! The job itself is great, it’s the corporate model and culture that’s really bad. The yearly raise is about 2-3% on average. You have a chance to get other raises based on your work but....... bad equipment, customers not knowing how to use their own tv, bad customer equipment, and outages effect the chance for those raises so it’s more luck than skill. The culture at Comcast is to always blame the employees. I’ve had 8 different managers and over 20 different supervisors during my time here. I’m currently looking elsewhere. Lots of seasoned employees choose to leave once they’ve hit a ceiling."
bad,"This company offers great benefits. Tuition reimbursement, Healthcare, stocks, paid vacations, and other discounts. The Call Center/ Repair Technician is not paid enough and the requirements for them (metrics) are not fair based on what they need to accomplish. Comcast is more about the bottom dollar than they are concerned with individual employees."
bad,I had 5 years left to retire and just wanted to finish doing installation but no they wanted to send me to home security which I didn’t want to do because the area we are in it is not prevalent. So I decided to retire early and after 21 years of service all I got was HAVE A GOOD LIFE!!!!
bad,Easy to learn and never over worked but lack of engagement. It can get very repetitive and boring. It is possible to become full time with Comcast but requires a lot of dedication
bad,"Money was good but that’s only because I was a long term employee that filled many positions with the company. "
bad,"To be honest, it started out promising. Had good benefits (health insurance, 401K, discounts on service, etc) but the department had very limited career growth, almost no training provided, management took forever to make decisions, thinking outside of the box was not just apethetic but discouraged. It was a job but no place to grow your career. Many network and data center jobs have either been outsourced overseas or converted to a 6-month contractor staff. They claim to be industry leaders but there are many other companies doing data centers much better, following industry standards instead of re-inventing the wheel and cutting corners to save money in unimportant and irresponsible ways. Management levels, at times, also seemed very disconnected with the daily operations."
bad,As a Sr field engineer I was able to perform my job duties as well as perform task such as building new processes and procedures and new standard methods of operations. I loved other departments and helped in area where asked. Was often called a team player and an innovator.
bad,"Managers didnt treat people well. Always asked to do more, with no pay increase. I was there and loyal for 20 years and got laid off due to my dept going to Denver.  Not even a opportunity to be put somewhere else in the company. no loyalty."
bad,I've been at Comcast for three years and it has gone down tremendously since then. They add more to your workload but has had a decrease in commission.  The commission is really the reason why people stay there but since that's changed it has changed a lot. They have a high turnover rate and they will fire ANYBODY!!
bad,"The technician support center is by far the worst job I've ever been in. The ""leadership"" will say you are valued in what you do and that our department is well thought of in the company. The way you are actually treated on and off the phone however proves that is clearly not the case. This department was created by the company to cover for the bottom 10% of sales, repair and field technicians. Rather than invest in the personel of those departments an entire new department was created 3 years ago to make up for their shortcomings. Let that sink in and you will know the TSC's place in the company. This is a dead end job with no advancement and two faced management like many others. I wouldn't write off the company as a whole though. Just the TSC."
bad,Standing on your feet for long periods of time. Have to lift and move equipment constant. Stressful situations with some customers.  Very stressful and time occupying.
bad,I think undercover Boss needs to be called for an episode. They listen to calls and judge incorrectly with people that do not have customer service skills or savvy that interpret quality wrong! They are becoming scrip-tic and cant keep good employees they do not give raises and do not care about long term employees!
bad,"Stressful workload, proven to enhance one's anxiety. Attrition is at 65% either you get fired over attendance or you quit due to unmanageable stress levels. The metrics change every month, you are expected to sell in every department even in retention. The pay and benefits are the only good thing about this company."
bad,"I worked her some years ago, almost 8yrs, had 5 or 6 differnt supervisors through out time, some were good and some just cared about there numbers, the company didnt understand differnt areas your routed in, have differnt tolls on time, care, customer needs, for example wealthy areas with rude rich customers may have more needs, are picky on the way you run wires and have 5 times more equipment to resolve vs an area with smaller homes and laid back people that were easy going ,but dealing with rude people and on how much they pay on there bill monthly, and will complain to you daily from job to job to job every day, techs will finds ways to squeeze into easier areas, so its a task to get routed in good areas, they took away senority therefore you can have techs with half your yrs over throwing you from a turf you may like more than others. If your a tech that cares and knows telecom theory you will rock, but your expertise may not even reflect your weekly metrics (numbers) one bit, beleive me there are ALOT of non caring technicians there that dont follow NEC codes there or care to deliver service in a correct manner, and there supervisors may just turn a blind eye to it daily, just not knowing how to go about due to no quality control there, I was asked to lie to a customer once due to lightning striking the network system (plant) and smoking the guys TV,which happens from time to time due to a tech in the past that just didnt check his job right. I refused to comply with the supervisor , honestly I dont think the supervisor deserved one bit to even be in ''telecommunications''"
bad,"I have nothing good or bad to say about this company, I feel that you are forcing me to write a review. I have nothing to say and would like to move forward"
bad,I was hired through a temp agency. It was a little difficult if it was hot there was no air. You would stand at your work station your entire shift and just refurbish cable boxes.
bad,"I actually started out with Adelphia Cable until their big blow up. That's when Comcast bought them out in this and other East Coast areas. When first starting out them things were pretty good.It was fun to work for/with them. There were a lot of fringe benefits and extra ""treats "" that were done for the employees. These things slowly disappeared as Comcast grew. Such as buying other cable companies and a TV network. And now cable company in Europe. Also they keep paying for celebrities to do commercials. The more they spend, the less we get. All of the fringe benefits are gone. Every now and then something is done in our local office, but more seems like something just to pacify us or so they believe. Also the trend is to do more with less, as that seems to be with any corporation. Starting pay for new employees is not nearly enough for what is expected of them to do. And there's no real training. They'll just sit with an existing employee. It's pretty much learn as you go and ask a lot of questions."
bad,"Too many ""metrics"", repeat calls for any reason will land you out of a job despite it being an inbound call center and the department deals solely with repeat callers and new subscribers."
bad,"I would never again work in a call center. Comcast has a cap on how much the average sales person should make. As the company makes more money, the sales persons pay ""matrix"" is adjusted so that the ""average employee"" will only make up to a certain amount. I met a lot of nice people there. But all of the sales people seemed to be unhappy with the pay potential."
bad,Extremly hostile work environment with low pay. Very stressful with unrealistic goals. Aggressive sales and firing procedures. Occasional promations and contests to make job enjoyable.
bad,Hard to advance with focus on metrics. They depend to much on rework witch you have no control over. No support system every department is against each other. Very low pay for the amount of work. Management is terrible.
bad,Typically they say its soft sales but its not. you must try to sell something on every call regardless of the customers situation. even if they call to disconnect you still have to sell. alot of people cannot afford the services.
bad,"At first it was GREAT! Then after a few years I realized the only raise I was ever going to get was less than a dollar an hour yearly merit raise. They push you to increase your CommTech rating to make their shop look better. Better pay is nice for a while. But the higher your Comm Tech level, the more impossible the metrics are to hit to get said promised raise. Techs are held responsible for things beyond their control. Such as if a tech does an install on one day, and within 30 days a neighbor's wiring causes ingress, screws up the signal on that node, that tech gets a repeat, which affects their eligibility for a raise. Sups say that can be 'spoken to' when it comes time, but never do. Comcast sells a good game. Excellent benefits, good time off, etc. But when they say your hours are 7-6, that just means they can/Will drop 3 hr jobs on you up to and after 6pm. They over book to allow for cancels and not home calls. Problem is they don't have a backup plan if someone gets hurt, or even just calls out sick cause they built quota too tight, or built the job wrong to get it pushed into quota."
bad,"could have better training overall "
bad,"Toxic Culture. 3 of 8 hours spent in meetings daily limiting time for actual selling,"
bad,"Not much in the way of caring for the employees or excellent hiring practices, but the job was okay and they gave you benefits. They don't really care about your performance at all, just as long as you get the job done and show up on time."
bad,Hated it. Wasn't for me. great pay but the actually job sucks. rude employees and people just dont care. you cant ever take time off or do anything else wt your life. you will be there forever
bad,you have to meet clients and take service calls to make the money . i really didn’t like the fact that if we don’t produce for them then we will make no money. how does a company that makes billions think that this a fair method of payment.
bad,"I'm not sure of what to say other than the fact that. "
bad,"Brutal work loads"
bad,Comcast does not care about their employees.  Would not recommend.  I would not return to work for Comcast no matter what they offered.  I am glad to no longer work there.
bad,"Tinley Park call center is a horrible work environment. Management doesn't support their agents and are very demanding. Comcast overall is a good place to work, but the Tinley Park is an absolute joke."
bad,"Poor manager, work except for billing portion was interesting. Tickets created by T1 were poorly done and resulted in angry customers. Culture was unpleasant."
bad,"A good opportunity to dominate the market. The management needed to be more aggressive in the their sales approach. The management needs to support the staff, team approach was missing."
bad,"Contract with insight global, nobody knew what was going on. Management sucked, they talked about, put you down, very displeasing, you can't talk to no one. When contacting insight global they tell you one thing and do something else. Insight Global wold not help you, a lot of bullying going on. Sigh"
bad,"work with property mangers and building ownership to gain access to "
bad,Everything is constantly changing and you are always being hunted down to see what you can get fired for. Constantly Are told to things one way then when it’s not convenient for them you are told to do an other way. And you pressed for having done it the other way.
bad,"Comcast has some of the most customer-unfriendly policies in all of corporate America, which is one of the main reasons they consistently rank as one of the 2 or 3 most hated companies year after year. In most cases, the technician is literally the ONLY human face they will ever see associated with Comcast, and by they time they do, they've already had hours and hours of their time wasted by the incompetents they have on the customer service lines. As a result all the anger and frustration the customers have built up from their prior terrible interactions with Comcast over the phone are taken out on the Technician who arrives to fix their issue."
bad,A typical day at work is being threatened to lose your job because a stat is .02 off from what is expected. Supervisors don't care about you. 80% of supervisors have no experience in this field. When they do promote within its someone who has been dishonest on the phones and got caught for it but some how still works there and got promoted later down the line. Your treated like a robot. If you sign off the phone for 5 minutes to use the restroom your supervisor asks you every time why you signed off the phone. If he call volume is that bad you need to hire more employees not try to make people feel bad for having to use the restroom.
bad,"Comcast had it's pros and cons. The good side to it is they gave you time off, discounts and fed you a lot. However the management there didn't know how to do the job that we were assigned so it was hard to relate to them for advice. The training was a joke until they created a mentor program which helped except now they're focusing on doing everything through online modules. It's a good place to work, but it's also strict in the terms you dont even have time to use the bathroom if you need to. Lots of micromanaging and they aren't very good with medical issues as i've seen lots of people be taken out by paramedics."
bad,"The workplace culture of Comcast is geared towards younger workers, The older and seasoned workers had a tendency to be forced out of the workplace. the younger yo are, the more thry adore you."
bad,"Constantly change standards. Change installer/tech metrics every quarter and refuse to offer training on how to meet standards. Since meeting metrics means a raise, very few reasonable raises given."
bad,Different locations differ by policy and favoritism. Good experience however growth from within regarding career building is now non-existent. If you are not looking for a long term career this is the place to be with decent benefits and bonus from time to time but again if you are looking at the long term this is not for you.
bad,Poor management and salary. Opportunities for advancement were low.  Although Comcast was good to the community they treated their employees very poorly
bad,it used to be a great place to work until new management took over. We were very efficient and now we are starting over with new dispatchers. All the progress we made is ruined.
bad,"Absolute nightmare to work for!  Lots of pressure from management to meet goals/ standards.  Multiple escalated calls per day from angry customers looking to pick a fight because that's the industry.  High-stress, high-anxiety with little regard for the employee.  All front-line reps are micromanaged to death.  Mush, slave, mush!"
bad,The job wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for management there. It's just terrible and they don't care. Money is average and benefits are okay but management wants you to kiss but or you don't have a chance of advancing there. Kiss up or your time there will be short.
bad,"Working as a contractor for Comcast.  Its risky and a gamble.  You have to watch dog every order to secure that it will in fact be installed and then hold your breath for 120 days because if the customer defaults in any way your commissions will be charged back."
bad,"Good company to work for overall, but you don't get paid enough for what you have to deal with on a reg. basis. Customers will scream at you EVERYDAY. However the benefits are decent and you can meet some great ppl that work along side with you."
bad,"Management always said to treat this business like it was your own.  However, after building your book of business in multiple states, we were informed that we had to pass all sales to zip code owners.  This turned the worst performer to the top due to deal passes. Poor management."
bad,"Lawless sales environment.  You have to monitor all your pending installs and keep on the back office folk, as they LOVE to push back.    Very taxing."
bad,You are just a number.  Upper management is ok with 50%+ turnover.  You are only as good as your last sale.  Very poor working environment.  You are stuck in a cubicle in a warehouse environment.
bad,"I have learned a lot at Comcast I went through 6 months of training before you can be a full time communications technician."
bad,"hardest job with working for Comcast was the lack of respect, the favoritism for certain workers and management. they have lots of parties and activities for their workers but alot of drama and inconsistency"
bad,"Troubleshoot svc., repackage plans, walk cst. thru charges & bal. due, sale products. Hardest part: repackaging plans with poor training. Mgmt. sucks."
bad,"The training is excellent but once you get out into the field, your hit with all kinds of things that arent talked about in training.  If you are a soft seller, this is not the job for you.  You have to be a little deceiving to be successful."
bad,Bad management benefits are decent fellow employees were the reason I stayed. Company only cares for them selves and not what everyone wants. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
bad,"Call center environment, non-stop calls. management is never satisfied, which attributes low moral of employees. Policy and procedures are very much in need."
bad,Have a high turn over rate due to agents not meeting goals for monthly quota. Pretty much if you're not meeting their expectations then you're going to get fired. Great atmosphere to work in and great people but the overall job experience is horrible. If they change the month to month quota and just have it as customers service people might actually like coming to work. They are constantly hiring because they cannot keep people due to monthly quota standards
bad,"Very stressful job, You get more to do every day and pay stays the same. You rarely see anyone advance unless they have friends or family in management."
bad,"Free cable is nice but it's not worth it, the pay isn't all that good and they could care less about your time. your almost always away from loved ones..."
bad,The management in Comcast was not great at all and the trainings for the departments were a mess no one knew what they were doing when it was time to answer calls because we didn't even know what our department was.
bad,Comcast Spotlight is a forward thinking company trying to find growth in a shrinking media world and with that comes a lot of change that impacts the employees.
bad,not a good person he is a person who do what ever it takes to get the job done by any means necessary. i guess its a good thing depending how you take it in at the end of the day.
bad,typical day consist of an fun environment with friendly staff. I learned how to be manage my time along with multi tasking different projects. I even learned how to work in the communications field and launch an entire program sit wide..
bad,Comcast is a difficult place to work constantly changing conditions coworkers are good to work with great team experience upper management is driven by numbers and metrics don't look at individual needs.  Most and joy of a part is the customers that you communicate with and help.  Hardest part of the job is being treated as a number and not a person.
bad,The company isn't employee friendly they will take everything from you until there is nothing left and then your out the door
bad,"Comcast overall is a good company.  Sales is disorganized but the industry itself can cause that condition.  Extensive classroom training.  What you are taught did not line up with what the managers wanted you to do.  Lets say Comcast does not ""walk the talk""."
bad,"High performer, no advancement opportunities, not able to work to strengths, mostly administrative duties, looking for training and development position, training."
bad,Stressful you get 1 day off and nothing is appreciated. No benefits or anything but headache. I do it until I can quit. It's like a big bandage every year the system gets no better. You have to do to much!!
bad,This place is a nightmare the people you work with are great those you work for are just sipping kool aid not giving a darn about anyone under them.  No room to advance up in the company you'll be stuck in the same spot for years due to their insane metrics they hold you accountable for. Set schedule with no flexibility that will be changed mandatory every year to six months. I hated most of my time here only good this is pay and bennies. Even that isn't enough to keep you here long.
bad,"I worked for Red Lion Hotel for one year exactly. Over the course of the year i have experienced, great team effort, but very poor management effort. Impossible job tasks were asked to be completed and they paid no regard the fact that the job task fast impossible to do. Workers were often placed with such a heavy load instead of getting off in 8 hrs they got off in 11-12 hours because the load was so much on one individual."
bad,"Huge company means employees are just numbers."
bad,"Some very good people work there, they need more management that has cable experience. Hardest part of the job is knowing more than your managers and directors and them taking the credit for your hard work."
bad,"Comcast can be summed up in two words. Corporate Stagnation. This company can only do one thing correctly. Expand. They've managed to buy up all the little local cable companies enough to own a majority of territory. Leadership couldn't care less about their workforce, and the workers who attempt to distinguish themselves, get put back in to their predetermined places. Pay is average, benefits are slightly above average. Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed."
bad,"Sales is a hard area to work in, he turn over is HIGH and the training does not fit the job.No other things to say about this company"
bad,This job was stressful just didn't feel appericated as employee. This job was totally number driven not consumer friendly.
bad,"Very stressful environment. A lot of people getting thrown under the bus for things. Management is constantly changing as are policies and work routine to the point where it is more disruptive than helpful. There is blatant favoritism, retaliation, etc."
bad,"they don't care about their employees, their customers or the rules they have in place. anything can change at any time. and the customer is never right. trust me"
bad,Bad to there customers and really bad to there own people! They make customers oissed off at the people that come to there homes by charging for things that should be part of the service.
bad,"If you like more work for less money, then this is the job for you.  The leads are recycled all too often and all of the departments fighting for the same leads.  If you enjoy doing more admin work than selling, then this is the right job for you."
bad,I was in a department that was called retention. Angry customers would reach our department and through no fault of mine try to resolve and save them. I was given eleven minutes per call although most required much more. Also had to be advanced to a supervisor with situations out of my control and knowledge.
bad,"enjoy people"
bad,A typical day is always different.  Our schedules changes day to day and so does our time off.  I have learned to work hard and to stay focused on the goals of my department. Management changes regularly so you have to adapt to the different management styles.  I work well with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is trying to balance work and family because of the change in schedules. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying and giving great customer service.
bad,"Bad experience, the training was not existent, I was bounced around from one manager to another. It was pretty much a sink or swim mentality. I met a lot of great people, but it is a position I would not like to do again"
bad,Fine if you are single and young. Not a Job that you can make into a career (although some do).
bad,Horrible experience. Company is just known for a having the funds to support a unprofessional establishment and can really careless about their customer's value. Management is trained to be very robotic. Wouldn't recommend.
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever worked. The company as a whole is smart and extremely business savvy and is making exponential gains in an extremely competitive market but the way they treat their employees at the customer service level is APPALLING. Comcast wants the service centers to be comparable to Best Buy, AT&T retail stores, and Apple stores but in reality, that is not a reasonable comparison. Those RETAILERS deal with customers that are going into their store to sign up for services that they know they want. They may deal with the occasional upset customer or customer issue, whereas in the Comcast service center we are constantly dealing with customer issues, complaints about the call center, mistakes made by the call center, faulty equipment, and the list goes on. Then on top of getting yelled at on a constant basis and being treated like scum, Comcast gives reps unreasonably high sales goals, so after dealing with an upset, hostile customer, Comcast expects us to sell the customer a service that they don't even know they want. And to top that off, the sales goals are obviously what gets you your commission, but your commission is what makes up majority of your salary, so your salary is never guaranteed. For the amount of stress this job causes, the hourly pay should be EXPONENTIALLY higher. "
bad,selling to current Comcast customers cable phone internet
bad,"Benefits are awesome, great way to gain customer service experience."
bad,"Comcast was a horrible place to work, Office personnel rude and made Technicians job practically impossible. Long days over scheduling of appointments causing techs to skip lunches or log on to lunch and work through it (was told to do this by supervisor in order to meet next appointment time) bad management short breaks. Co-workers technicians great but office personnel and call center personnel rude with techs overbooking appointments for certain techs due to personal issues with the tech. Comcast claims that they are Military reserve friendly by they are NOT! Supervisor and HR REP would openly complain in front of other employees about having to give techs the days off so they could perform their obligated military duty!!!!"
bad,I worked with comcast six years and management is horrible unless you are sleeping with a member of management that's the only way to advance and grow you have unrealistic goals to meet each month or you will be written up there is slot of favoritism and if management don't like you you might as well look for something else re only good thing about this company is the benefits and free courtesy services that's it otherwise terrible company that's poorly managed
bad,"If I had this decision over again I would not work at Comcast. I was hired for Direct Sales and after working there for a while, I realized I got sold. Turnover is very noticable and they believe in Management by intimidation. The do not care about about thier employees at all. Dont make the same mistake I did and waste 6 months of your life. I resigned and I also cancelled my service with them."
bad,"very stressful, low pay, decent benefits. i dont want to write a review but this website is forcing me to if i want to post my resume"
bad,Its not the best job i ever had but it pays the bills..It has been one of the most unprofessional companies ive had to work for.
bad,inbound calls workd in sales but was required to assist customers in all areas of concerns
bad,Taking Incoming Calls and providing Customer Service to existing subscribers and new customers.
bad,"Up sell Comcast products, services and promotions. Accommodate limited range of subscriber"
bad,if you are a aggressive sales person this is the place for you
bad,I never worked for a company that has so many opportunities for a employee and many of them go to waste.  Most often due to poor management.  Ever wonder why your cable bill was so high?  It is because of this waste.
bad,"You get no lunch, your raise is based on how well your numbers are each month but they base your numbers off equipment that goes bad and this is 12 years old and also if the customer has any issues within 30 days. This was a good place to work 4 years ago but now they micro-manage everything you do."
bad,"Churn and burn, micro managing,  ask salespeople to do what managers cannot do. excellent benefits only positive here"
bad,Completely micromanaged with a revolving door mentality when it comes to job security.
bad,"As a ComTech Comcast offers great experience in technical advancement.  It is nice to not have to be confined to a desk all day.  However, if you dont like interaction with people-it is not the job for you.  I enjoy being albe to solve customer's tecnical issues. It brings me a sense of pride and accomplishment.  The hours are long, and the shift schedule changes every month.  Weekends and late nights are mandatory. This makes it difficult to manage a family and Doctor's appointments etc.  Overall, it is a rewarding place to work."
bad,"5 weeks of training how to begin new accounts, answer questions for potential customers, develop suggestive selling practices.  After learning these essential skills in order to help with new incomming calls from customers, our job task was switched to handling customers who were irate, ready to cancel their service, and disputed bill questions.  None of which we were given any training to perform."
bad,"Great Company, I made many good friends at Comcast."
bad,"I liked the money aspect and bonuses on a monthly basis. Inbound outbound calls in sales to set up new accounts, transfers, etc."
bad,"Seems like free cable was about the only thing I was excited about after being with the company for only 6 months. I was getting so tired of hearing answers like, ""I don't know"" or ""there is nothing I can do about it"" or ""it's just the way it is..."" or ""can't you handle it yourself?"" from the management that I lost respect for some of them. There are people in this company who have been with Comcast for 20+ years and I just felt like some are just waiting to retire; they lacked any sort of motivation or will to motivate other people. Management was so poor that sometimes we would not have a manager in the store throughout the day. It was frustrating trying so hard to help out a customer and make sure they leave happy when you don't have a manager to support you - making the job more difficult than it needs to. I'm sure Comcast will catch on and realize that organization needs to be implemented critically, internal miscommunication between call centers and stores due to lack of training, customer retention from uninformed customers about their bill increasing, and better management team needs to improve somewhere down the line."
bad,the benifits are great... but the managment is not behind the team. You would think that with such a huge company they would have the employees backs but they dont. they are more centered on pushing you out the door...
bad,My experience at Comcast was to help customers reap the benefits of a triple play. My behind the scene experience as an employee was that they really don't care about the customer or the employee. I was treated unfairly and thrown to unemployment. I am presently trying to letigate an wrongful termination suit.
bad,"It's an okay place to work. Flexible schedules, 9 week paid training, metrics are doable."
bad,My coworkers are fun and enjoyable to work with Office location is too islolated not near any major transporation lines cafe restaurant is closed you only get 30 mintues for lunch The hardest part of this job is that it is very stressful the employees should be allowed to take stress breaks it would help to increase employee productivity
bad,"ironically, the customers were not the problem. unprofessional supervisors were the problem."
bad,"I loved working for Comcast, but the management here in Springfield, IL was horrible!!! Our call center was great but Human resources was full of en inept individuals."
bad,Bad place to work. Only looks at the stock price and nothing else matters.
bad,Under paid and over worked without any structure in the leadership positions
bad,"Comcast talks about valuing employees, but this isn't seen in their actions. Comcast expect employees to be flexible, but is rigid in the application of its policies. Training consists of supervisor reading power point presentations"
bad,I was a good employee never written up promoted a lot then one day I get hit from behind in my work vehicle ( not my fault) reported it same day went to the clinic to get checked out had a slight bulging disc doctor said do light duty they would not give it to me kept asking and no light duty  so Comcast had the opportunity to acquire Turner Broadcasting so they did a massive layoff and they let me go after 11 years  of working and said they couldn’t find me any work .
bad,"Red tape, exploitive in nature, salespeople do the work while upper management leeches off of your success/bringing in new clients. There is an opportunity to make money but it can easily be offset by the culture"
bad,"I felt for the compensation they expected way too much from their employees, often at the expense of their customers.  They also focused more on your shortcomings rather than trying to lift you up by focusing on the areas you made improvement on - you could never do an excellent job, it was even stated that noone gets the highest review rating, whether you deserve it or not"
bad,High School culture. Higher Management is old boys club.  Lower Management and HR are deceitful and corrupt.  They want you to lie and cheat to sell to customers. High turnover with little chance of advancement unless you brown nose or know someone with authority.
bad,The attendance policy is very strict especially during the first ninety days of employment before you become permeant. Though the training is extensive you don't get an accurate feel for the daily job until you start taking live calls.
bad,"Many promises, but nothing concrete. No written procedure,  no direction.  Many people are doing the same thing, but in their own way, making it quite confusing. No a good work environment."
bad,They give you extensive training and you get yours first raise fairly quickly after that it all goes down hill. They had me doing billing as well as repair so basically I was doing 2 people’s jobs but only making the pay of one employee. I would have calls ringing off the hook back to back angry that they waited a long time to get to me while other people in call center are chilling and have no calls cuz they weren’t trained in billing.. keep in mind my so called billing training was a whole 2 hours where they gave me an example of a bill. And said this is what the bills look like and this is where the amount is.
bad,"Hire at your own risk. Make sure you are liked by your leadership for their HR and policies are built to only be a benefit to the company and not the employee at all. They will ask you to change daily, give no notification of new project launches and terrible training, but still hold you accountable. As long as you are liked by you leadership you will be fine. If not, their processes will allow them to do whatever they want. Great benefits and great pay if you work lots of hours. Used to be an awesome culture of employee, customer and company. Become very unorganized with the wireless addition and will ask a lot of you. Work life balance is a struggle there. Too grey for this to be a place of trust. They will replace you."
bad,Stressful quotas that need to be met. These quotas are designed to get customers off the phone as soon as possible and not meant to work well for customers who have a lot of issues the company lacks synergy with all the other departments
bad,"What a terrible environment – we were actively encouraged to lie to our customers and get them to raise their bills."
bad,If you can not care about pushing packages onto people and not wanting to understand their situation this job is for you. These people dont care what your going through. Just pay up or get your products off. Period. It's amazing how they call it soft selling but yet make you interrogate the guest.
bad,"Pretends to be a good cultured environment, has discount of services, provides van, and training provides uniforms. Poor supervisors, mgr sided with them always."
bad,I loved the job just once you go out as a tech you are expected to know the job with just little training. As oppose to those who have been there for x amount of years. That is my only complaint not enough patient with new hire
bad,"While Comcast is a good company to work for, that is only the case if you are an FTE. Unfortunately, contractors get treated lower than dirt. I do not know from personal experience, as I never became an FTE, but I have heard that once someone goes from contractor to FTE, there is a marked change in the way they are treated, which is unfortunate IMO."
bad,Call centers are very messy places to work at. This place was just not for me. It is very unprofessional inside a call center environment there. Supervisor treated like dirt in the employees are very coddled. I would definitely say it was one of my worst jobs. Management team was very fake.
bad,Poor advancement good ole boy network for promoting pay not wnough for cost of living good benefits otherwise cafeteria onsite. Training poor. No recommendations
bad,"It's a typical call center. But the longer you work there the more you see you're ripping people off. You get hired to do billing, save people money, while expected to make sales."
bad,I was an outside tech at comcast. Not treated half as good as inside employees something about out of sight out of mind I guess. It was a job I was promoted to supervisor and was asked to fire the tech that had been there for more then 15 years cause they made to much. Wanted me to pretty much make stuff up. I quit some of those people where my mentors and friends that gave  the majority of their lives and when above and beyond  just to get fired for no reason.
bad,"Great discount on cable , but as a technician your work life balance was to the wayside. you are just a number no matter what you do or how good you are."
bad,"no advancement to other positions, too many changes at time, inconsistency. not enough time to breath in between calls, very stressful and negative vibes"
bad,They have a very competitive atmosphere that make you feel forced to make sales that the customer does not want.   they have goals that if you do not meet them....you are gone.
bad,"If you like difficult metrics, impossible time frames, and rude customers, then go ahead. Some of the metrics are purely based off of your performance, however most of them are solely based on the customer perception of you. Alot of times you will be double stacked jobs during multiple timeframes throughout the day making it to where you can't make your next job on time, thus affecting your metrics. And no matter what the issue is, it is always Comcast's fault. It doesn't matter if they don't know how to use their computer or TV."
bad,"great benefits. Horrible management, they are unorganized, unfair and often criticize employees that they don't take a liking to. Work environment is stressful and you are fired if you do not meet sales quotas in a 2 month period"
bad,"Comp plan changes anytime a department is making too much.  They will hire within and it's all about who you know.  The benefits are great though. Free cable, internet, 401k and life insurance"
bad,I enjoyed my colleagues but the company as a whole they look at us as numbers not human beings. The sales they want you to obtain when the customer's service doesn't work is ridiculous!!! If you miss goal too many times you will lose your job.
bad,They just expect you to get to much done and deal with to many things that are outside your scope of support. You can end up doing 7 jobs at the lowest level while management sits there making money doing nothing.
bad,They use all employee benefits as a crutch not to pay you more .  Technicians do the most work in the company but are greatly under paid. Good benefits medical day one.
bad,Sadly maybe I got stuck with a bad manager who unfortunately was good at sing and dance and friendly with HR. Did not follow principles of Brian Roberts. Another contractor working with me also quit. He worked to break you confidence
bad,"Aside from benefits (discount on cable/internet) , not worth the headache. More attention paid to new employees than tenured reps. Management is too reactive instead of being proactive. Constant changes to compensation plan. Supervisors leave without reps being notified.  Every department is required to sell in order to make decent mkney, which leads to poor customer service."
bad,It's been so long since I've worked there. I don't remember much except my co-workers and my supervisor were awesome people to work with and the commission was good.
bad,"The benefits are nearly unbeatable and the pay is decent depending on what job postion you are in. Pay increases each year. The amount depends on your performance and the companies performance. Quarterly bonus are also very nice. The amount depends on how much you make and as well as how well the company is doing. Most jobs that  Comcast offers and the ones I have held are all customer facing.  Unless you know someone who knows someone, it is hard to get another decent paying position in the company from my experience. I have been laid off once by the company in 8 years.  Consistent training is lacking and clear communication is an issue. I would recommend the company for the benefits but not much else."
bad,The marketing department at Comcast is awful. Too many cooks in the kitchen for every decision. Poor communication from corporate office to division to regions. Management has no clue how to make their people better at their jobs. They simply hire people from the outside instead of trying to promote from within.
bad,Depending on what department you are in Comcast is all about sales.  The pay and monthly bonuses were good.  The employee benefits are great.  Employees paid very little for cable and internet services.
bad,"not enough pay at comcast not enough room for growth , have to stay in the same position for 1 year they rather hire from out side then to promote from with in"
bad,"•	Incident Response (SIEM"
bad,"The pay is okay for the positions offered... Comcast services are included as a benefit. Promotions were few and far between, I worked there for 5 years, over time, the abuse from the customer interactions became  too much to handle."
bad,No structure when hired here.  I had to develop my own procedures and follow them.  Learned the business as I went along.  No real training provided. Confused on what was expected.
bad,"Everybody does their work. Nothing special."
bad,Working for comcast was very fun when i started it was alot of changes being made but no results were shown. The company pays really well but very cut throat on the policy and seems to not care abt front ine employees that much
bad,"This would have been a better place to work had there been better support during the learning phase. Its was hard enough trying to keep the time down on the phone but reaching out to someone on how to process an order for equipment using chat was ridiculous. But in all fairness, this was subcontracted thru a company called Arise who are all but a joke. They charge you to use the Comcast training and you dont get paid at all during the nearly 2 months of training you have to undergo before you can work for Comcast. Now that I know better, I would never do this again. When I finally did start getting paid, they did not even pay me for all the time I was on the phone and good luck trying to contact someone to talk to them about it. You wont!!!"
bad,"Comcast does take care of its employees and offers great benefits. It's one of the most accommodating companies for disabled workers. "
bad,Comcast preaches employee first but does not follow it.  They pay much less than market standard and expect a lot.  i would not recommend working at comcast.
bad,"job was horrible experience. the commission pay out was horrible had to make at least 65 sales to make a decent check of about 2500 dollars, which is absolutely insane. when I worked at at&t making 65 sales in a month would get you a 6700 commission check not including your hourly pay. this is for telesales position. in inbound you can make money but outbound you can not and its hardly any job opportunities to move around in company. also there hourly wage is absolutely horrible. 11.15 a hours is trash compared to att where you can make 19.21 a hour"
bad,Pay is low due to union in my area. Insurance is good which is the only thing keeping me here until I can find something better paying with good insurance
bad,Comcast is a great place to work. It wasnt really for me the envoroment was relaxed but the job itself was stressful.  I would reccomend anyone to work there just be ready for customers that constantly argue with you daily
bad,"Initially working at Comcast was great. Eight week training period, Monday through Friday, 8:30-5, then your shift is assigned based on department need. While in Billing, 11-730, MTThFSun. Retention M-F 8-430 (great shift, but the calls slowly destroy your soul)."
bad,"I met some good people during my two year tenure, however the career advancement program wasn't at all rewarding, just a ""I completed this"" type of thing that in the end had you still taking calls. Watched less qualified people win awards for being ""yes men"". Seems to be all about kissing the correct behind to get anywhere there. Very stat oriented, if your stats are good you get a toy or stress ball, bad stats and you're grilled as if in boot camp. The customer isn't valued and employees would often joke over customer problems saying the customer was begging and crying to watch tv. Like I said, fun while it lasted."
bad,I would work there again under different management. Did learn so much in sales and being a technician. Obtained several certifications that allowed me receive more knowledge
bad,Do not work here. Low pay and favoritism on every level. They may say they are there to help you advance but actually they don’t care. Seniority doesn’t matter as far a schedule change. The customers hate Comcast and they take it out on you.
bad,Management us too busy to develop employees. Benefits are the only reason I stayed for as long as  I did. Culture is that everyone is stressed out as this is a high pressure sales environment
bad,The job is great for a high school graduate starting out. Company will take advantage of you if you let them. Wonderful benefits with free cable. Fast paced environment. Little room for advancement.
bad,"While working for Comcast I ended up wearing more than one hat that became pretty overwhelming.  For a period of a couple years I was completing the duties of:"
bad,The people who work there do but the policies are dumb and often could be construed as lying to customers. They tell you things are true when they are not just to get the full balance paid. They forget this is not a need it is a want... they can and often do go elsewhere. The bills are way high and out of control pricing.
bad,"Unethical practices to further take away monetary benefits of hard working workers, favoritism, racial bias, unorganized, unrealistic goals and unfair practices."
bad,"Ok work environment  , needs improvement  with management  and training.  Pay good,  hours good,  not a place for advanced mentioned.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Comcast looks for any way it can to hold you down and go in dry, you don't even get the courtesy of a warning or the typically recommended spit before they bend you over and just really poor it on you."
bad,"As the industry grew more competitive and the response to the advertising decreased less focus was put on active customers and more focus around new business.  "
bad,"The culture is one of hypocrisy. They teach one thing in the Management/ Leadership courses; however, they practices something totally different. If you did not conform, you were ostracized. Not open to new ideas or ways of doing business. If you do not submit to the culture, you can be expelled from the organization."
bad,"Comcast doesn't pay their telecommunication technicians enough. cost of living is NOT considered. they take advantage of people! their motto: ""it is what it is""... roshard green."
bad,"I really liked this job when I first started. However, as time has moved on, I am now seeing that this is not the best company to work for. You get multiple different answers from multiple different people om one thing. The company is all over the place, and it just seems like no one knows what they are doing."
bad,high call volume from the start of the day to the end of your shift. manager/supervisors did not keep you informed on the work place. they high call volume was the hard part of the job and they only give you  5 minute per call to assist the members/
bad,Very competitive environment.  Constant quality call reviews.  Not quite sure what the ultimate goal was since you were scored poorly on just about every reviewed call.
bad,The job was fairly low stress for the most part but the pay was low and no room for career advancement.  Management hand picks in advance who they want for what job they want.
bad,"Worst job ever. This job is all lies and the managers do not want to help you at all since they do not have to clock in, they hide out all day. There is no respect for the reps,"
bad,my time working at comcast i spent more money getting the job and maintaining the job then i did making money by performing the job. it became very time consuming and limited choices when it came to time management.
bad,It is still a cable company in the eyes of many customers. Bad reputation with customer service. Too many people in too many jobs and super saturated markets where it is hard to sell the products. It could be a cool place but ping pong tables are not going to fix the problems.
bad,"Declining Wages,  presentation of bare-minimum legal OSHA standards as a benefit. "
bad,it was an alright jobs for there was just sometimes that in a week time i would work 30 hours and only get 2 sales after the the third time it happend i found that i needed more stable income
bad,The culture for this location is unprofessional. From the top management down to the outsourced vendors. The overall experience was negative. Staff moral is low.
bad,A typical day at this position involved quite a bit of travel over several states.  The senior management team did not communicate well at all.  The culture was poor at best.
bad,"You have to fake it until you make it. Bring your supervisor snacks and lunch to get off the phones. No room for advancement if you don't meet your metrics. If your placed with a supervisor that's professional and can communicate without being judgmental; you'll have a remarkable shift. If you work day shift, calls aren't that bad; however, night shift is very heavy. Calls are back to back and sometimes can be intense. Whatever schedule you choose when a recruiter calls you you're stuck with that schedule for a full year so choose wisely. If supervisor and managers are retrained or revamped with new faces, I will consider reapplying."
bad,"Does not pay good. No good chances to move up within company. Also, they stopped caring about their employees as people and only as numbers. Comcast could care less about the person and only the numbers."
bad,Comcast does not have a great attendance policy. If you get up to your mark of UAPs  you have a 6 month final. Which means you HAVE to be on time EVERY DAY for 6 months straight. I went on medical leave for 2 months so when I returned my final was extended 2 more months so for 8 months straight I was on time to work (which is not the problem. Someone should be on time) I was 2 weeks away from getting off my final FINALLY AND was a few minutes late due to the weather and heavy traffic and they still let me go. It's just unrealistic ESPECIALLY when you have a family. The company has some pros as far as bonuses and awards and things like that but the environment is way to stressful for the little pay you receive.
bad,management only cares about meeting numbers and cares less for employees as long as the job is done nothing else matters. if you have an issue do not go to human resource they do not help
bad,"Over worked, not enough techs for the demand required. Almost impossible with the metrics to level up. Supervisor was tough, but very fair and knew what she was doing. Would have stayed if pay was better."
bad,"At first, a very good company to work with.  Couldn't keep a manager and got rid of a lot of good workers.  I left because they shut down four offices (we went to work one morning and found out that was our last day)."
bad,"The Co-workers were like family, we did have a good time on our own time and working with each other, but the job was so stressful with changes and metrics that was needed to be met. The commission was changed to often. No fairness @ this job"
bad,"no comment, I have nothing good or bad to say about the company . lack of amangement . they are horrible. bad work place no work life balance. the pay is ok"
bad,as a technician I spent the day traveling throughout 3 counties and installed and serviced cable products.  if you were a good worker you received the brunt of the work while slackers hid in their vehicles
bad,"The enviornment is very cut throat and competitive. There is no work life balance and no flexibility. I had a boss there that sent me explicit and disturbing text. I felt obligated to go to work even if I was very ill."
bad,When I first started at this job I felt as if it  were the perfect company but they don't care about your personal life and in order for you to make it any where in the company you will need to suck up to the supervisors.
bad,Manager hired people he know from other company. Would rig surveys by calling and doing surveys on weekly basis. Did not pay severance because he was upset I left as soon as they announced out department was being let go before he had chance to pitch another idea to try to keep team
bad,you work a lot of over time and supervisors are lacking in there jobs the only way to become a supervisor or higher is to be cut throat and back stab don't plan to have a life outside of Comcast
bad,"The company put many requirements on to our department that were, in most cases, not obtainable in the given time frame.  The work place was very fast pace with very little praise for the job performed."
bad,"Comcast cable is a very stressful place to work. There are times where it should be fun but even then stress plays a big role in the planning and carrying out ""fun time"" for employees."
bad,"They don't pay their employees well for the work they do. They have a culture that isolates people. The only way to really make it is to get promoted, but promotions are very hard to attain"
bad,good benefits ok pay friendly environment. decent pay ok work culture hardest part of the job would be the customers once in a while and the late shift
bad,"management is much support and there metrics are unrealistic, you have no time to breath and collect yourself. its call after call and team leads or supervisors are much help"
bad,"8 hours of stressful door to door knocking. They promise all this money but you only make that if everything goes right with the install. Too many other ways to obtain service, so you are competing against your own company."
bad,"management was horrible, constantly changing roles and procedures. Supervisor never on same page as upper mananagement and at any moment you could be downsized to help the company save money"
bad,Spectra Seven i wouldnt recomend it to anyone the company looks out for there selfs and only thereselfs.  they would constantly find ways to not pay you  for the work that you did.
bad,They often start initiatives for employees that are not followed through.  Thought silos and little training.  Very unstable at times layoff are frequent and as a result performance declined.  Project priorities often change.  Little guidance from management.
bad,The hours are super long and you get the late night shift. You stay on that shift for a very long time and the pay is not worth the stress. I do not recommend working at Comcast.
bad,Need more from the company and the way they take care of there employees and I worked there for almost a year and they did lil to nothing to help me they say they are about culture and family that is the last thing on there mind they do not want to help unless you have been there for at least 5 years.
bad,"Disposition on the ipad  50 doors per day, talk to at least 20 people, Get 8 cable sales, 8 Internet sales, 4 phone sales and 2 home alarms every 2 weeks in a designated area. After working that territory for months they could take it away and let someone else have it, and not give you credit for a sale you received from your previous turf. At least 2 meetings per week, Technicians do not show up to the appointments quite often and then the sale you worked hard for gets rescheduled and then they cancel because no one showed."
bad,I found Management to be unresponsive when i had problems with a Town called Agawam  residence followed me police harrased me community was very rude.
bad,Comcast sets ridiculous unachievable goals and merits set by management that they can't even achieve and when you speak up about issues they always mention the free services and benefits you receive from being an employee which is not worth your sanity I went from being happy to migraines every time I went to work Management and their micromanaging skills makes the job miserable at Comcast
bad,"I would go door to door trying to get people to switch from dish, regular tv, fios, ect  We had to have thick skin as sometimes we would have doors slammed in our face"
bad,"Great benefits and opportunities, however no communication between departments and their is not a lot of management support available in the direct sales role"
bad,"route techs from one job to another, assist customers with changes being made on services  make sure the tech make their scheduled times to the best of their ability"
bad,Everything would be ok with this job if management would communicate better. Were the communications company and don't communicate among ourselves.when a product drops one should be prepared for the product as well as how to use it also. Time is changing and so is technology. The products we offer are great if everything is in line with whats needed for the product to work properly.
bad,Highly competitive internal environment with difficult sales goals.  Management team was highly focused on metrics.  Solid sales opportunities with mid-sized organizations.
bad,The supervisors here can be annoying but overall it is a relaxed environment your coworkers are very kind and do not mind assisting we needed.  The benefit are great as well
bad,Do not work in billing. Work in corporate or do not work for this company!!! They have unrealistic expectations. The only good thing is the discount on cable.
bad,customers call in and yell and scream as well as call you horrible names. So if you can handle that this is the job for you. The management is ok but when you try to move up don't count on your stats to help you. You will have to be friendly with the manager to get the job.
bad,No room for improvement and very strict in the way things are done.Management expects you to work all the time and no benefits recieved as a result.Very stressful work environment.
bad,"Never enough to satisfy, negative atmosphere, call center environment was bad.  Hours changed quarterly making it hard to plan life and very difficult to verify commissions."
bad,I enjoyed working and seeing new people everyday. I actually worked for a company that sold comcast and did not actually work for Comcast. I only worked there for about a month.
bad,"A great place to build a teamwork environment, with co workers that will last for years.  Decent benefits provided to employees, with free, or near free, services provided. Call center atmosphere is that outside technicians suck, and we hate them. Be prepared for this if you're a tech and transfer to the call center."
bad,they only care about the dollar at the end of the day.  your just a number to them that can be replaced at the end of the day.  couldnt care about there customers one bit
bad,"Handled general account inquiries and troubleshooting of company products to resolve service issues as appropriate."
bad,all key decisions within the company are made at HQ / Philadelphia.  The regional offices by default risk being directed by the priorities of HQ - which can differ.  decent environment.
bad,"The pay was very low i did 8 years for the company until day laid me in 5 other guys off.Senior techs who been there for a while.They wanted me to go back to 11.50 and hour with all the talent i had,i took the package and moved on."
bad,"Out of all the jobs I've had in my life, Comast was the absolute worst.  The employees are well under paid for the work they must do.  I never felt the customers or the employees came first.  Answering calls was the sole focus."
bad,When I first started working at Comcast people were making six figures.  Each time I watch the compensation plan change I watched stellar sales reps get paid less.
bad,The part of the company I was in had no real advancement opportunities.  People have been with the company for over 10 years at the same position so there was no room to advance.  The management style was horrible and they really do not care about your work life balance.  When you tried to switch positions you would be deigned because they like to micro manage all positions.
bad,"More specifically, as my resume indicates my qualifications include sound decision-making skills, drive, and a desire to succeed. Because I am seasoned in the Comcast telesales division, I have thorough knowledge of the concepts, practices, and procedures. Likewise, I also possess the ability to motivate and coach others in effective sales techniques and telephone skills and etiquette. Throughout my tenure with Comcast, I have consistently exceeded sales goal by averaging 170% to sales goal, and I am a six time member of Above and Beyond Club for achieving 150%+ to goal."
bad,comcast was a great compny wieth great pay and great benefits.comcast is a customer service friendly basis and is all abouthelping hier company benefit from others
bad,the job was hectic to say the least loved the work i did tv phone internet and home security.immediate supervisor was very secretive but knew his job upper management had such a difficult time with processes you knew what was what. My co workers were great best part about job was helping customers
bad,When I started with Comcast it was an awesome place to work. But after 15 years of loyal service all they care about is money! Every employee is expendable and they have no problem reminding you of that on a daily basis. They have no clue how to improve customer service and no matter how many millions of dollars they spend to turn it around they will never be able to. They will always be the most hated company in the USA! Eventually all great powers crumble and I hope I can see this happen in my life time.
bad,"Extremely poor management and competency of all levels of management. HR does not serve as an advocate between employee, employer, and customer but rather bends to the will of the company and sides with management although unethical practices are carried out on an almost daily basis. No room for advancement for people of color and if you advance too quickly as a person of color, they find a way to move you out the door."
bad,"Good Paying Job with Great benefits, Just crazy Turnover and Management could do better work with communication. Job Culture is off and on,Stressful Job and no Job Securit."
bad,"I would start the day from home and leave in my work van to the first job. When I arrive I would assess the problem, explain to the customer how the problem would be resolved, then execute. I would normally finish 5-7 jobs a day in various locations. "
bad,"As a technician you can work up to 15 hour days. It's hot in the summer. Its freezing in the winter and rainy days are not fun. You'll go into dusty, damp, and sometimes infested crawl spaces, basements and otherwise uncomfortable working conditions. You'll drive a lot, You never know what kinds of personalities you'll encounter, Some days are light work loads others can be very tedious.Its a dangerous job. It's not for those with fear of heights. I've been to a funeral for a co-worker who was electrocuted. Its a physically unforgiving environment but, you get free cable, vacation, sick days, stock purchase options, and insurance if you want it. There are a very few paid holidays also. It can be great if you work in a nice neighborhood and with a congenial crew."
bad,"Great medical benefits and coverage. Work with a lot of people so environment is very high school-esk. Management was a coin flip as to if they where good or not on the lowest level, but the higher you get the more the gap between the few good managers and many bad ones grew. They blatantly do not care about there employees and you feel like a monkey in a chair to them. It was a great job for the first year or so that I worked there but then there was a huge culture shift that took away the local leaderships ability to make decisions and it was all down hill from there."
bad,I look the benefits that this company has to offer. The pay could be better and there is room for growth here. I just hate that you had to be in your role for a year to advance.
bad,"A lot of opportunities are available. Having the support from management is key."
bad,"I have increased my productivity by 20% every year and I get paid less because the company cuts commissions. The company spent $350 million on a merger that didn't work and when they lost those profits it was decided that they were paying their sales staff too much, while every year they increase our work load."
bad,Sounded great to start with and paid very well initially but in the end they just don't offer whats required to truly be successful at this position without a whole lot of luck.
bad,"In a small office, a technician has to be able to do everything in order to maintain employment here.  Advancement is rapid for those that are capable.  Micromanagement is over the top and often.  Benefits are the best I've ever seen, but at a cost of working a lot (on call for 1 week/month)."
bad,The job had great employee moral and made everyone feel as a family. The positions and the work knowledge was unorganized
bad,"Can be a really fun place to work and the benefits are excellent. The management changed policies, procedures, goals, people and commission structures what seemed to be almost every week. In two years and hundreds of people I only saw 2 people get minor promotions. There is no sense of job security as call centers are notorious for extremely high attrition rates."
bad,"some policys are nice and friendly. work environment is not good."
bad,working started off great.. however management was poor and then the environment went from great to poor. met great people and made great friends
bad,"Comcast was grown too much, while not adhering to efficiency principles that can maintain a good level of customer service. They believe on working harder as a means to shore efficiency, instead of working smarter. Within the last four years, the management structure and practices have been regionalized at all levels, in a strict silo model, offering very little autonomy of work and a great deal of lack of communication between departments. While the company pushes harder every year to improve their quality measures, it does not have the proper audit efforts to ensure the quality is well measured and accurately attained. Time measures related to management practices and technical work are not regulaly means-tested to ensure a well balance workload on its employees."
bad,"Stressful work environment and atmosphere"
bad,"I read negative reviews on other job sites prior to accepting the job at Comcast.  They seemed to be focused on being treated unfairly so I disregarded those reviews.  The one positive thing I can say is that from my experience the employees are treated fairly.  The ones that are not treated fairly are the customers.  I could not continue to work there in good conscious.  Every single day I came across multiple customers that it was painfully obvious that they had been lied to by Comcast employees.  Management does not encourage lying to get new customers or keep existing ones but it is very obvious that they look the other way and when employees are caught cheating they are given a slap on the wrist."
bad,"When you come in in the morning, you're immediately bombarded with jobs that you are not trained for and management that just themselves started a year or two prior."
bad,"Suppose to be a fun place to work. You go through 3 weeks of training that is not bad, only to learn that you didn't go through everything you needed to know before getting on the phones. this is my experience and the the experience of those hired after me. You're on the phones just winging it trying to make sales and they just hope that you catch on. you get one 15 minute break even though you're there 4.5 hours. This job is for those who are familiar with all the services of Comcast going in. You cant go one day without having technical issues whether its the phone, the software systems used or the computer itself. the thing that really gets me, is that you have to work there a full year to switch departments. Its not all bad. they do have flat screens that show cable even though its without the volume. You get discounts to a lot of places. It will definitely make you a little more talkative and inspired to sale yourself better then you have before."
bad,The hardest part of the job is not knowing the company direction. Lack of leadership development. No room for Growth with the company.
bad,"pay was not competitive, took me four years to make 11.30, the company was becoming a joke and most of all cheap, could not move up within the company even if you were more than qualified, it was about who you knew and management slept around with other employees"
bad,"Fast paced, ever changing and advances in cutting edge technology, lots of talent in all departments."
bad,worked in sales office as only male in store for 2 years and sales is so easy for me that the woman would ask me to hold back or pass on sales so the other employees can make sales quota's
bad,If you can work for Comcast you can work for anybody. They do not appreciate their people nor do they utilize them to their benefit.
bad,"Overall, Comcast has a great compensation and benefits package. However, I often found myself fighting other sales people in other departements over the same customer. Literally arguing about who should get the sale. This atmosphere is intentionally set up this way. It seems that the company truly doesn't care how they acquire the business, as long as they do. Makes for a very unpleasant working environment that really wears a person down."
bad,"If you have anxiety, do not work there.  It is a heart attack waiting to happen.  Too many people i know that started there are now on medications to keep their anxiety strait.  "
bad,"Was constantly changing from one new manager to another and constantly changing teams and rules. Months of job training required every year, difficult to earn more since seniority get all established clients."
bad,"They train to do the job for about 6 weeks before you start.  Its pretty easy, particularly for the mechanically inclined.  Training and the job itself isn't hard, no matter what they may tell you.  They try to make it sound harder than it really is.  The only guys who seem to have trouble are the ones who don't know how to deal with people.  So you'll need some people skills too."
bad,Bad place to work . Management is clueless . All about the shareholders. Not a good place to work  at all . Never work for this place
bad,The different departments have no idea what the other is doing and this needs to happen to work efficiently. Could be a lot better place to work.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. High turnover,  they treat the people on the ground level the worst. They have out sources in the Philippines that take calls and dont know what they are doing and then I would have to deal with irate customers. Its a culture where you lie to the customer to get sales and hurry up and get to the next call. Management talks about lower level employees and when you reach out for assistance they won't help you."
bad,Customers are fine work is fine most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time.
bad,"worked there five years, had nice coworkers and benefits, time off, health insurance eg..Borderline abusive workplace. Customers allowed to say what they want to you. Pay for today is sub-standard. Raises were a joke, .25 an hour does not even cover cost of living increases."
bad,"Comcast Spotlight offers good benefits and free cable services."
bad,"Have you ever had to deal with comcast for service and had a difficult time? "
bad,this company is very inconsistant and has poor customer service. all agents are not on the same page not even agents in the same call center
bad,This was a good job just a bit far from where I was. There was a disconnect in communication with managers and staff.
bad,"Comcast in Memphis has an ""every man for himself"" culture.  The management is very poor."
bad,"Outbound cold calls..management told me to ""tell the customer the promo expires Friday"", ""if you add TV I can give you a bigger discount"", ""these documents are time sensitive""..bunch of lies.  No wonder many in the public loathe this company.  Procedures make it difficult to do your job and employees are not empowered."
bad,"Compensation not good. "
bad,"It is the good company in-terms of domain, but stuck in that position for multiple years and no growth opportunities.   Also management is not decentralizing their efforts."
bad,"It's hard to advance in this company. You really have to know upper management and be a brown-nose to get ahead. Meanwhile, leadership pushes a lot of stress on you to make your merits or they'll write you up (3 write ups and you're gone). A lot of micro managing is done and it really gets in the way of things. ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS COMPANY IS A PERFECT PLACE TO WORK IS BECAUSE THEY'RE A CORPORATE PUPPET AND THEY GET PAID A LOT. Not to mention, managers get nearly a 20K bonus while the REAL workers of the company get a few hundred. Comcast will act like they care about you but they could care less. I've been hurt a few times on the job and not once did anyone from Comcast ever ask me ""are you ok?"" Instead, they sent me to take a drug test and treated me like I didn't even work for them. I've never been written up before, my merit numbers are great, my pay is fair, but I also make sacrifices to keep it that way"
bad,"Work is nice at times, you learn many facet of cable installs. Management was ok at times, coworkers are helpful as well.. Working in attics can be difficult, due to what you breathe in your body. Its great when you make the customer happy."
bad,I enjoy the employees but the expectations for Supervisors keeps increasing to unrealistic expectations.  Some are afraid to take time off because they are concerned of getting too far behind.
bad,Long . How to make customers happy.Job isn't very hard. Somewhere to start off and build your career.
bad,"I only worked here for 3 days because it sucked so bad. I worked 14 hour shifts all three days IN A ROW. I worked during the graduations, so I dealt with all kinds of stupid people, ordering all kinds of things from our 6 item menu. ""Do you sell _____?"" ""No."" ""What about _____?"" ""Sir, read the board for our item list."" ""Wow, you guys are EXPENSIVE."" ""I don't control the prices sir."""
bad,Comcast was a ok job to work didn't see to many good opportunity to grow with in the company
bad,"Comcast puts the almighty dollar above their customers, their employees. Company constantly trying to cut costs at any expense and is usually at the expense of the customers. Comcast values their customers $$ but that's about it."
bad,"Comcast is an environment for a young professional. There is little room to grow. Once you enter into the call center environment it is quite difficult to advance from there. There is no confidentiality with management or human resource. There secure line you can call to issue a complaint is managed by the former human resource director Susie Messmer. I've know many people to experience retaliation. Majority of the time the retaliation ending in termination of the employee. The benefits however, are amazing."
bad,"Inbound calls. What I learned from this job was expect the unexpected at any given time. All co-workers were busy at all times. The hardest part of the job was trying to please the customer and the company at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer said ""Thank You"" at the end of a call."
bad,"Comcast has great benefits and free cable, internet and home phone."
bad,This is a customer service job in which the customers are usually irate most of the times.  You are giving a under performing computer with faulty programs that crash and stop working frequently and are forced to maintain certain metrics that if you don't meet you are subject to corrective action
bad,"	Successful Business Account Executive for the Nation's Leading Fiber-Optic Network providing Business Phone, Broadband Internet, TV, and Ethernet Data Service."
bad,I enjoyed the onsite gym. Very good training. Diverse environment.
bad,"Solid engineering work with no job security, no seniority, no opportunities for advancement and inaccurate management assessments of company evolution."
bad,Its A great place to work but the down side is there is no Advancement and Management do not communicate the employees my Coworker was a great group to work with my supervisor was a great lady if it was not for her i would not know now she taught me a lot about the job
bad,"cheap, dirty, treat emplyees like slaves, dont like to pay people."
bad,"No longer work here - however it was  nice to assist customers"
bad,Comcast corporation is the largest Cable provider however the work environment was very demanding and sometime not worker friendly.
bad,"Its only part time at nights, customers calls about billing issues are might have just seen a commericial about whats new at cocast and want to try it out. Its a very friendly envoriment nothing hard just wish I could gt more hours management is great you can always talk to them and they understand things that ost jbs wouldnt."
bad,"potential to be a great place to work.  Company uses old and out dated systems, company needs to fix ivr, "
bad,"I don't recommend this company for anyone who is family oriented. The days consist of long hours and little to no regard to family needs. There is absolutely no consideration given to family emergencies whether scheduled or unscheduled! The management is poor, and there is a lack of communication throughout the company as a whole. Management abuses their authority by covering their actions  with their favorite company motto ""based on the needs of the business!"" Advancement should be easy due to the size of the company, but growth within is very limited to who you and who they know! The best part of the job are the benefits! The company has a great benefits package and many company perks."
bad,"Job was good, Management was Bad, After I left both were fired."
bad,very busy work load
bad,Not the best work place to work in..But it was a learning experience
bad,No balance between Home life and Professional Life. False since of Team atomsphere.
bad,"Comcast will suck the life out of you. It is very difficult to help customers with their issues (the majority of your day). Management has reduced the workforce so much and filled your day with so many meaningless tasks, that it is very difficult to get anything accomplished for the people that really write your paycheck (customers). The workers that remain there are over worked and are too bogged down with corporate minutia to actually please customers. This is why Comcast is rated as one of the worst in customer service year after year (but Wall Street is still pleased). On one end you are ground down by the customers (who are right most of the time) and on the other end you are ground down by management (who either don't have a clue or just don't care about the customers). Everyday you go home feeling like a well used punching bag. If you need a job ... take it ... but after a few years on the job at Comcast you will feel 30 years older and dead inside. There is far too much bureaucracy and not enough common sense. Comcast is too big to fail completely. They will just keep grinding up front line employees and spitting them out and still never have happy customers. They (management) will however, pat themselves on the back and keep those bonuses flowing!"
bad,"Good company to work for in most areas;but, falls way short in the training area, and in advancement opportunities."
bad,"job is fun but hectic, management is not helpful. co workers are helpful."
bad,"This was a very stressfull job,the employee gets it from all sides customers constantly complaining,and supervisors not caring at all,if your numbers aren't right supervisors, are on your tail, so you get your numbers right then they want to keep you there,no advancement.And most supervisors dont want to interact with employee's or customers."
bad,"A toxic working atmosphere, with an upper management that is arrogant to an extreme negative."
bad,"i started as a customer service rep.i loved taking in bounds call,trouble shooting over the phone.comcast started to excell in more products. like internet,phone,and on demand services.it was fun working in the call center.then i went to warehouse, warehouse was better.the company stressed on availilbilty."
bad,The benefits are nice that are offered from the company. Management shows favoritism to the ones they want and the ones that challenge are questions certain things they begin to give corrective actions to up to and including termination. Some of the corrective actions are not even worth the write up but they will start emailing and having side conversations about the employees they want to get rid of. Getting a raise that it actually worth something is nearly impossible. Other companies offer more money for the different types of services you support where Xfinity does not they expect for you to support all the services plus day of job support for little pay.
bad,"The work was comfortable enough, but there were very few if any opportunities for advancement. There was a lot of busy work to be done and it was rarely communicated what our work was being done for, other than the occasional comments about how messing up would cost the company money."
bad,Not a good fit for flexible work schedule and the culture and environment isn’t good  there is no gym or area to relieve stress or women to go to pump breast after pregnancy
bad,co workers are decent people everyone tries to help each other training is good but comcast customer service sucks bad and it will be the death of them
bad,"Stable company with great benefits. Hiring process is abnormally long. Poor work/life balance, long hours, no set schedule. Will work very early mornings for inventory, nights and weekends. Frequently short-staffed. You will be on your feet for 10+ hours in the retail store."
bad,"Not a good place to work, company uses you for everything they can get out of you and then disgards you. Only concern is the product and the product only, employee moral low and stressful"
bad,"I was a Door to door Sales Associate for Infinity/Comcast selling cable and internet packages. Rather that knock door by door I would find new builds, plant extensions and ""hunt"" houses that recently sold or under contract for a much more targeted approach. Unfortunately changes on the compensation for anything off turf made continuing in this manner impossible."
bad,Walked on eggshells in business tech. There’s a big us and them attitude. Lots of judgement and whispering. No incentives or team building. No gratitude towards employees. Excellent performance gets no reward. If you’re working hard to get promoted you’re seen as a threat and you will be gone.
bad,"Get it in writing or it doesn't count. They work for the community, providing services to gain an outward appearance, but the volunteers are underpaid, underappreciated, and get pats on the head for the cooperation while the company name garners the press and kudos."
bad,advancement in the front counter sales // Xfinity sales is none existent. they dont do it they would rather hire someone from the outside then promote from within.
bad,"I was told that my position as a retention agent would not be put under any pressure to sell products/services. After training, pressure was applied.."
bad,"calls are back to back all day long. the metrics quota change so often that its hard to keep up. my title was repair agent but i had to handle billing calls, retention calls and repair calls. even with taking calls for 7 different states handling 3 different departments calls i only got paid for handling one. co-workers we awesome but every one did seem to be a bit stressed as we we getting cussed out by angry people our entire shift."
bad,"Lost the family feel, became a number and nothing else. What used to feel like a small family has evolved into a robotic work place. Becoming a push button operation."
bad,"The job of customer service representative at this company has changed from being a balanced one that includes billing, sales, and resolving escalated calls to mostly a collections job. Especially since they outsourced many billing jobs and send sales to the direct sales teams. The corporate benefits are standard, but the company lags greatly in meeting its employees needs for better training and  opportunities for growth. It is not a sustainable full-time job because of the demanding nature of the customer service role. Many nasty and disgruntled customers are always calling to complain or demand better pricing. The industry is changing rapidly and Comcast is having to work harder to keep up with the competition, but always one step behind the curve. Even though the company considers itself in the vanguard."
bad,"I am a current employee here. The company is terrible. I have never seen a company in which the service goes out more than Comcast. It is one thing to help a customer out but you are expected to sell to a customer that is upset with their current service which is rediculous to say the least. I feel the customers appreciate me more than the company does. You are rated on call handling times and QA reports which another employee grades you on certain behaviors. It doesn’t matter what the outcome of the call was. If the customer is completely satisfied on a call you are evaluated on but you don’t hit every behavior then you get a low score. You are told to be genuine on the phone but in reality that is not real. The bonus is after 90 working days so in reality it is four months. The training barely prepares you for live calls. The pros are that you do work from home. Also, the company goes through periods of Mandatory Time Off so 40 hours a week is very unlikely. If you look at it as a job that you didn’t have, you will be fine."
bad,It was an okay job until they took 743$ out of my check and said I was over paid. They were not wanting to investigate and did not plan on giving me the money back.
bad,"answer calls about billing and fix wifi and tv issue - Just too stressful."
bad,"Started out great but the company has the tendencies to cut funding and increase prices to both employees and customers. Constantly lowering commissions and raising goals, expecting people to work extra to make up for short staffing and punishes you for doing your job too well by constantly giving you more work and taking away money for reasons outside of your control. The turnover rate is too high and if you have any experience you are expected to work like a manager without the pay."
bad,Job security only counts when it fits with their direct managements objectives not with the company's. Regional management has too much opinion on their interpretation of what the company actually is asking. lower level has no opinion.
bad,"Training was the best part of the job. When you finally reach the sales floor your on you own. Your supervisor may critique you here and there, but unless you can make sells your just another number."
bad,I felt as if Comcast was a complete wast of time. The position that was advertised was misleading. The location of Comcast was ludicrous. The pay was just as insulting.
bad,"This place is one continuous exposure to abuse.  Not only from the more than dissatisfied customers, but the objective of trying to extract more and more money from long-term customers for an antiquated technology (cable) makes the sales aspect horrible.  Realizing that the future of cable will not be their core business, they have turned Xfinity/Comcast into a wireless phone store.  Staff stand all day, there's no break from the constant stream of people coming in to return equipment, complain about their bills, and your job is to try and ""up sell"" the poor souls that want to save money. If you like daily verbal abuse, then this is the place. The time of the monopoly cable providers is over with the options of streaming, Netflix, etc.  No one under twenty five even has a TV, and long-term prospects for this overly large corporation won't come from this division, good luck and pass by this horror store--particularly the management staff in Ann Arbor that have no interpersonal skills and should've been fired years ago."
bad,"This company is in a downward spiral when it comes to ad sales."
bad,Offered job as a technical support rep; was told I could boost my income but there would be no quotas.  Management grew very frustrated withh my lack of sales.
bad,"My time at Comcast was brief in comparison to my current position. In that short time, I met co workers from various backgrounds. Most of whom were very dedicated and hard working. Unfortunately much of this was marred by poor management who ignored phone calls from representatives forcing many of us to form lines at their desk while we had customers on hold. This hold counted negatively against the representatives in spite of it being not their fault. I also remember a particular supervisor knitting instead of helping her team. It makes me appreciate how fortunate I am to work for my current employer."
bad,"Working there has its perks, at times I felt as if it was used to cover the stress. The benefits will keep you around, full paid tuition (that you would have to pay back if you decide to quit or be terminated) The calls could be so intensive at times and other times you may be able to catch your breath in between calls. "
bad,"Comcast has amazing products, but the management is not the best.  They are driven by personal goals and not team goals.  The lack of honesty and transparency runs rampant in many areas.  There is a tremendous amount of politics."
bad,Working at Comcast stared out ok. The longer you are there the quicker you find out how much they care about there employees. No offering permanent position after probation period was very un motivating
bad,"It is semi productive place where ""how much you know others"" matters a lot. It is an excellent environment to work with lots of technologies like Python, Pandas and others."
bad,"nothing to discuss, daily pay along with quarterly bonus and sales compenstation, This position was great 5 years ago, but comcast does not reconize tender employess"
bad,"Long hours , Supervisor is not knowledgeable, Their system for metrics is awful. Comcast will have you rather lie to the customers instead of helping the customer to reduce rate . Management is awful !!"
bad,"Comcast is a ok job, they want alot of you with the no pay to match, no work home life balance. You have to watch management, and make everything crystal clear"
bad,At this location not all there is a place privacy for l lactating mom's and gym onsite access at all times no worry about getting in shape the management team cut throat if one didn't like you then made sure all were not there to offer you support
bad,Working for Comcast is a great company to work for if you don't have any children . The benefits were great and the pay was amazing . Mgr in the call center that i worked for isn't the Best .
bad,"They are trying to become customer focused, but don’t show that they are. Poor communication with rules and regulations between management. The culture amongst employees was great! Management does show favoritism here and will not admit to it but watch their actions. For what is being dealt with from Comcast previous customers and their experiences representatives should be paid more but it seems the company doesn’t care about that."
bad,"I use to enjoy working here so much, i would even encourage other to apply. That has since changed. Nobody at the center is friendly everyone acts like they do not want to be there including the supervisors which affects everyone. Its very gloomy. Metrics don’t even make sense, i work in REPAIR but i am constantly reminded how much i am not not selling to people who complain the bill is already high."
bad,"Pay starts out good at 16.00 annual raises poor, management poor and supervisors not helpful. Company micro manages time doesnt care about quality of calls wants sales at any cost. Impossible to get time off, blocks days before and after holidays and non holidays ie Super Bowl weekend. Metrics constantly changing."
bad,"The benefits were probably the best, the free services, cost of medical and the retirement package was good.   However with the company be profit focused leaves little room to improve customer service and offers that can be made.   Due to unhappy customers the jobs can become really stressful as you end up being the customer’s punching bag with little action on the company’s part to improve the process even though they’re marketing team pushes that they are improving."
bad,"My experience at Comcast was not very good.  I don't think it is a bad company to work for, but I was brought in at a difficult time of transition and not given much support, training or air cover.  "
bad,Severely Cutthroat place. No room for advancement unless you were in upper management. Upper management tended to delegate their work to lower levels without clear instruction or support.
bad,"Its a big company, people aren't valued as employees and are always been pushed to drive for bigger results without matching that desire with and appropiate wage. You will typically only move up in the company if you know someone, and the metrics used to rank employee performance are impossible for anyone to currently achieve. I am looking forward to putting my time working for them behind me."
bad,"Overall, the people are great and so are the benefits, But this is drudge work plain and simple. And the pay is not commensurate with the knowledge and skills required to do the job."
bad,Area management are inconsistent with goals.  Changes every month for a couple of years then area manager is replaced. Regional employees are not paid enough for the work they are doing..
bad,"My particular organization has a funnel.  You are trapped into a specific spot, with little to no room for growth.  My direct management, doesn't help improve their employee base, and generally seem disinterested in their employees."
bad,"This is a position within Comcast's call center.  The main duties are handling inbound customer calls related to billing questions, accepting payments, and escalating customer complaint calls."
bad,"raises were very low 3% a year didn't cover cost of living increases. Especially with the housing market going crazy, its hard to afford something on your own.  No advancement in my dept, also unexpected layoffs are happening."
bad,"Poor Management and Human Resource Department.  The Management was notorious at laying people off when they were there gor 10 years.  Additionally, the manager would ""fudge"" both EPR's and Financials behind Corporates back."
bad,"I briefly worked with Comcast and the call center type of work really damaged my view of the company overall. However, my co-workers were great to work with!"
bad,"The benefits are awesome. The pay is ok with commission. But the management will not communicate changes to employees. Or I suppose the more honest statement is they will not do so accurately and honestly. I am beyond frustrated at being told to expect one thing and then the day before the change is supposed to happen, it is actually to something else and it is worse. This could be a policy change. It could be a change in the call flow. It could be a change to commission. It could be change from a promise sent out to the call center as an email (during the winter storm in 2017 we were told if we worked overtime the calls we take during that time would not count towards our numbers.....then after everyone did overtime we were told they would.....fun) . The morale right now is at an all time low, and the numbers are not that great because of all this. Management is in flux as 2 managers (not supervisors) have left in the last 12 months which is insane for us. I am telling you reading this, if all you care about is pay, this is job has that. But if you want to work in a healthy environment, look somewhere else."
bad,"Working at Comcast Loyalty Center takes nerves of steel. You are the last person to speak to a customer who is usually very angry. You have to be able to take being verbally abused on a regular basis by people calling in, knowing that you are not allowed to release the call for any reason."
bad,"Its very hard to work for a company that has customers that hate them. Its also hard to be forced to empathize with customers that complain about a bill they choose to have, maybe if my supervisor was a rep 1st she may have a clue about our position but she wasnt, she started when i did. She never took supervisor calls, so it put all of our team in bad situations. Upper management didn't care"
bad,Comcast is a great company as it is continuing to grow every day. However as it is a large corporate company it can be very cut throat and political.  As a person coming from a smaller company with close knit groups it was defiantly a culture shock.
bad,"Management did not want to work with you when it comes to Quotas, gave the same call list for the same customers, there was also alot of favortism shown throughout some of the employees"
bad,"Very poorly managed."
bad,"Management did not care about it's employees. Breaks were timed and there was little room for error. Do not have an opinion or you will be written up. "
bad,"A typical day as  Customer Care agent includes talking to customers about bundles and deals to retain customers and of course always upsell.  Although the interactions with fellow coworkers are a major plus daily, the atmosphere is stressful and more than not employees are on temporary leave because of the constant changes in commission payouts and structure, performance scorecard, and quality analyst scores to rate your call behaviors. The workplace culture is very diverse and friendly environment. The hardest part of the job is worrying abut your monthly scorecard as this determines the commission received and sometimes the information is determined weeks later. Also, agents from other departments rely heavily on this department to resolve all issues and more often than not the call has to be taken since seen as an opportunity to upsell already frustrated customers. The most enjoyable part of working here are excellent healthcare benefits and  the products/services."
bad,It wasn't my type of job. I couldn't see myself working in this field. The management was poor and disorganized. The hours were hectic and didn't fit around my schedule.
bad,"This is a work from home call center solving wifi related issues for Comcast/Xfinity, but frequently evolves into other duties not listed in the contract."
bad,I worked for Comcast for 2 years and the commission is terrible. You can sell the highest package and only get paid 25$ dollars out of it. I really think Comcast is a complete rip off to employees and customers as well.
bad,"Have to wait a year to advance or move up in the company. I only had 6 weeks of training and was pushed on the floor, a bit stressful at times. You get yelled at a lot."
bad,"Never know if your job is safe. All the managers are a joke, they say one thing and do another. They bring you in by saying this is not not other call centers, but actually it is."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Comcast it's self, but the other silly things outside of the actual job ultimately were a serious issue."
bad,"The money and benefits are great. However, you don't know from one day to the next if your job is secure. Local managers were awesome...District managers were not. Those at the top (i.e. Philadelphia) think that an office in Chattanooga can and should run the same as one in NYC. There is nothing further from the truth and they refused to listen to their employees."
bad,"Has a commission structure that benefits the employer more than the employee, will say that its ""uncapped"" to make you feel like you can make unlimited money as long as you're willing to put in the work but it's just to keep you taking the calls, any call that isn't a sale will cause you to lose money and with the way the calls get queued you'll receive maybe 80% non sales calls to 20% potential sales."
bad,See Glassdoor for more insight. It varies from team to team. But my Experience with management was very poor. It was a toxic dog eat dog culture. And the deal breaker is that the manager and director basically worked there for 17yrs(starting out as installment guys) and basically they behaved like it. I have nothing against older people being in the workforce but guys like them are the type of people that need to be laid off in order to bring in fresh talent (not young people but experienced people who know how to manage people and love their craft).
bad,they preach that comcast is a family but they will cut you loose at the drop of a hat with no warning if the current area manager doesnt like you. so basically you have to be a friend of someone higher up to keep your job.
bad,"As a tech you are required to be the Technician, Customer Service, Billing, Sales, and Plant Maintenance all for your customer. You also get paid less than all. You are required to climb dangerous heights, fit into very small cramped spaces, work sometimes in complete darkness/into the late night, fight with nature, and deal with insects/spiders that you didn't even know existed. For 10 hrs min days 4 days a week. While during your workweek, you cannot plan anything to do after work because you don't know when u will get off. Your scheduled for 6:30 end time but will over run that time 95% of the time. You are pressured to produce unrealistic numbers that you cannot control because they depend on the plant integrate, customer's understanding of services or area issues and customer service training. If you do not produces these numbers then discipline will follow up to termination. Bright side, your cable is cheap, overtime is over abundant, benefits are nice or average for a company this size, you work alone through the easy and the extremely difficult jobs, you meet interesting and important people. you drive a company van, don't pay for gas and tools/training is provided."
bad,Comcast is in a general sense a good place to work if you keep your head down and your mouth closed. If you have a problem with policy or try to fight it you will not last long before you are labeled a troublemaker.
bad,Not a professional atmosphere. Unethical atmosphere. A lot of the time you are being micromanaged by management. Management can be unfair with employees.
bad,Good luck making it out of Telesales!  It's difficult to explain the type of management style at Comcast.  Employees are pressured to make sales quota's and are given low commissions as an incentive.  You give your best communication and whether the customer purchases is totally up to them.  It's difficult to make sales with existing customers being so unhappy with their existing products used from the company.
bad,Warehouse personnel are not appreciated and often looked down upon by fellow employees. There was zero chance to move up in the company. Benefits were good but pay was low and morale was even lower.
bad,"Typical day at comcast  was basically filled with a lot of calls. customers not so happy but they were willing to be patient and get the help they needed to resolve the issue. Hours not so great but they did have a lot of contest to let us go home early and to win prizes every now and then. Office parties for teams. Management was ok always in meetings, not my most enjoyable place to work but a call center is not for everyone"
bad,"Comcast as a company is great but the call center in N Charleston has snakes that work there. If you start and the tenured folks dont like you they will stop at none to get you removed. There are a select few of people that has your best interest but there are a few that has worked there for a while and has built relationships with HR, and upper management and if they dont like you they will make you dislike your job and feel like you are walking on egg shells everyday. If you choose to work there PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS. When you start you will see exactly what I am referencing."
bad,"In a nutshell, if you are a sales rep they will not let you make the money you earned. They steal money from you PERIOD. I would not recommend working for the team that I currently work for. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of the company."
bad,Comcast only thinks about the company and treats the employees just like the customers. They out source the calls. Management does not listen to the employees. They might show they do but their mind is already made up. If you currently work there don't make it your final stop. Maximize the opportunity and try to find something better. Customers are always giving the wrong information
bad,every day is battle to keep your job. compensation is good but you feel as tho your job is constantly being threatened. there is zero job security as a sales representative.
bad,"I believe this company has the potential to be a fantastic organization. Having said that, middle and lower management are severely disorganized, lack focus and do not support their staff. The mission shifts from week to week. Lack of continuity."
bad,There's a since of confidentiality among higher employees that over powers the individual rights of an ordinary entry level employee at Comcast. Communication is key and should become more apart this company.
bad,"I began working for Comcast out of desperation.  I really needed work and they paid handsomely in the beginning.  After about 6 months of me working my butt off and being relatively happy, upper management decided to change our compensation structure.  I went from taking home 4-5k a month to under 2k.  The manager who hired me and I really enjoyed working for quit due to these changes and many others were either fired or quit themselves.  I am surprised I lasted so long.  It ended up being a meat grinder, where I saw coworkers worked to death and then terminated, and they would just hire new people.  It was door to door sales, which in this day and age is not the greatest approach especially when you are universally hated by potential and current customers alike.  But it made me some money and I was able to go back to school with that."
bad,"I am a mother of two small children. I work from 1:45 to 11:30 p.m. I am never home for my children who need me during these most important times. I have complained to mgmt, but no one cares. I cannot continue to work like this."
bad,"Advancement opportunities are gone, I do not recommend this as a career path. I'm sorry to have wasted my time here. My customer interaction has been flawless and as much personal gratification one can receive from getting the job done, gratification as an employee is non-existent. Each employees (speaking as a field technician)position has a metric system that is based on figures that are uncontrollable by management and prevent most everyone from advancing in their career. My metrics are affected when other techs follow up on my work and do things incorrectly! I don't know how it is legal. Stay away for your own good"
bad,All of the managers are 20+ year employees with no education or management ability. Everyone told me to pass on the offer and I made a mistake. Don't do the same.
bad,"tough job with no compensation. the more equipment you have, the more pay you will receive because of you will be able to do much more work with more equipment. But it is expensive to buy all the things you need, shovels/whomper/drills. and you will need a variety of drills shovels and what not."
bad,"Although the job itself was very simple, the lack of proper management at Teleperformance was distasteful. Workplace culture was very relaxed and welcoming. Best part of the job was the taco lady who would sell delicious meals during lunch time"
bad,"I worked in the Telesales department. As far as management in that department is concerned a lot of the supervisors and team leads at comcast did not act professional.  There was alot of favoritism going on."
bad,Flexible work schedule since I worked mostly from home.  Provided an opportunity to meet and work with some decent people.  Very challenging work environment.
bad,This department laid me off due to a team of sales reps that would not follow leadership.   Poor leadership was what created the failures of this dept.
bad,Department was disorganized and compensation was low. Our goals for sales changed daily. Initial compensation was misrepresented. Hopefully the department turns it around.
bad,"not enough pay for the work you do, alot of stress, supervisors are not helpful, they would rather see you fail than to help you advance, all they do is lie"
bad,When i was their they did not higher the correct people for the job management wise. To much favoritism which allowed co workers to kinda play with the system a bit.
bad,"I was a in-house residential installation technician for Comcast overall the job requires a lot, and you also have to pass the Comcast university to to keep your job. This is a performance based job. Everything is about your metrics. If you don't do a good job out in the field, you wont succeed as a tech. My downfall was my repeats out I the field, which ultimately lead to me leaving the company."
bad,"Comcast was a very fun employee focused place, management really did all they could to work with people. But after moving into the Liberty Lake location that all changed. They no longer cared about employees more than they cared about numbers. They outsourced their HR team that dealt with FMLA and Job Accommodations. The company in charge of that was not good at all. While I was there everyone I know that needed FMLA was fired because Sedgwick the company in charge of that department never approved any one"
bad,Comcast gives you an opportunity to make plenty of revenue but no time to spend time with my family. There is also no real chance at advancement unless you are very popular.
bad,Run far away from this positon. You work all day for little pay. They expect a lot with little to no tools. The good thing is you have a lot of freedom with out having a supervisor breathing down your back.
bad,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and making sure you bring up all your links and tools for the day. I learned new products almost everyday and learned how to speak with upset customers in a way that will deescalate situations. Management was there to help you along the day if you needed it. Hardest part of the job was that it could become overwhelm your personal life because of the busy schedule, new products that have to be learned every day and trying to reach your goals for every month can be stressful as well."
bad,"New ideas were never accepted!  Not so much ""Open Door Policy"".  Have to go with the flow and can't be too vocal.  Things are moving slow, but yet business is changing and management/decision is not ""reacting"" fast.  Pro is that good benefits and deep discount on cable/internet/phone."
bad,"In 7 years I have had 11 supervisors, 6 managers, 5 directors, 4 Vice Presidents of Sales and Marketing.  Also for months' at a stretch I was left without any management to speak about the major changes in commissions, policy, pricing and inability to create customer solutions."
bad,At Comcast customer service is a top priority. However the company is putting their efforts in the wrong area. You wake up every morning knowing some one is watching every move you make and listening to every word you say
bad,"I work in the direct sales channel.  I help develop and coach sales reps to become better at offering cable services to residential customers.  Through solid, confident door openers we engage conversations that help discover and overcome obstacles of former and nonsubscribers in residential homes."
bad,They will be quick to promote newbies with no college education to supervisory roles and cut pay for people who have worked long enough to keep the company standing. They really don't care about how hard you worked and the energy and time you spent listening to people who abuse you on the phone... New managers are definitely needed. I think its time for a change.
bad,I had all good days at work I learned how to hooked up the cable lines at all the co-workers was good to me it really nothing wasn't hard about the job
bad,I worked for Comcast for a significant period of time.  I had a hard time leaving due to the fact I had so much seniority.  The main issue I had is that they treat both their customers and employees like commodities.  They really lack a personal connection and that is ultimately what drove me away.
bad,"I've been with the company for over 9 years now and I've seen many changes."
bad,"Unless you were friends with the managers, no one was moving up. They could care less if the employees have a family and will make people work the worst shifts unless you can prove you can produce. It's also very hard to move up in the company."
bad,"Didnt really care about advancement from anyone that wasnt ""Front Line"" so Salesman or Technicians.  So much change going on that once a year they laid off a big chunk of employees."
bad,"Can be a fun atmosphere with the right team. Time off and benefits were excellent and the friendships gained were more important. However, the company structurally is very flawed and operations seemed to change by the week. Upper management consistently changed every few months as well as schedules and shifts being extremely inconsistent."
bad,"Job started out really well until uppermanagement decided to take tech support out of the job. Now working at comcast regardless of posisiton, is all about sales. Me fixing customers issues and doing what i was hired to do is way down the list of importance. Job security is strictly tied to sales and is the only thing that matters to upper management."
bad,Alright company nothing great. Meetings with management weekly numbers and reviews.  Monthly training for new products and procedures.  Fair time off.  Misleading promises with changing department and location.
bad,"I used to love working at Comcast, I was hired for salary plus commission. About three months ago, they decided to take us in the Billing Dept, the lowest hourly paid employee in the Company, they decided we were no longer getting paid Commission for upselling, cross selling, retaining the customer, etc. "
bad,a busy day filled with calls from customers. we try to prevent customers from disconnecting services as well as attempt to sell any missing lines of businesses
bad,"The job is not so bad if you aren't a customer service agent. The management is out of touch with the agents. I commend management on their attempts to connect with the agents through supposed ""morale-boosters"", but they do not place enough emphasis on the skills/abilities of the agents as it pertains to advancement and job opportunities. Management would rather force opportunities on those whom they have personal dealings with (who usually have no corporate presence) instead of making opportunities evenly available to every agent.Tenure is totally devalued. Training is not evenly distributed, but reprimand is doled out with fervor. The opportunities for advancement are limited to a certain few and no amount of hard work, talent, performance, and skill can change that."
bad,Working at Comcast you are reminded that you are a number and treated like a replaceable part by someone else who would do your job for less money. It is company above everything and that the most important thing is the needs of the business regardless.
bad,"Typical day requires that you work in a face paced, high pressure environment with the majority of time spent on phones resolving customer concerns and complaints. Would often require defusing angry customers."
bad,"Just don't understand why the retention department is the least valued by regional and national management. You would think the department that is the last to speak with frustrated customers that are on their way out the door, would be more invested in. No, they take more value in sales and priority and retention is constantly overlooked and the department is full of talented individuals that end up leaving because of it."
bad,"Exceptionally tough place to work. You are expected to provide customer service while not actually being able to help the customer.  Your hands are tied preventing you from actually lowering costs, extending promotions to loyal subscribers, and proactively managing the account.  Very frustrating and low pay."
bad,"This is definitely a job that 's not fit for everyone. It really depends on the type of life you live and the schedule they give you. In my experience, I had no work/life balance and that's the most important thing to me since I am a mother. The process of selecting a schedule doesn't allow you to get the best work schedule that would suit you, it basically just lets you get in where you fit in with no regard to how it can disrupt your personal life. Instead of being able to select a schedule that fits your life, you have to pick and choose the important things in your life to fit around whatever schedule they stick you with. There's a lot more I could say about my personal experiences there, but the easiest thing is to just say it really isn't for everyone and leave it at that."
bad,After 1 year and some months of employment.  It is really a company that makes it sound like a chocolate frosting chocolate cake.  But the way that you get treated by the company as a customer is the same way they treat their front line employees.
bad,Comcast claims to have an open door policy but the moment you go to them with a problem they are trying to find the quickest way to get you out of there you get no help from supervisors or management which makes it very hard to do your job and the way they treat their customers makes you feel bad for them company is getting worse
bad,It is just a part time postion. With the a chance to grow within the company.
bad,Many calls disputing billing and charges to statement from one month to the next. I have learned the value of product is worthy of the cost of the service. The hardest part of the job is the hours and length of stay in this position before other options are available. The most enjoyable was the training for this position.
bad,"I interviewed to work as a direct employee. Never worked for them... Except as a contractor."
bad,"More concerned about the bottom line than providing good customer service, very numbers driven, required to sale even if the customer calls with issues, feel that they are laying off senior people to either outsource or bring in employees at a much lower rate by relocation, disguised by right-sizing. Management lacks insight and support"
bad,This was a job not a career.  Working for Comcast you quickly will see how expendable you are and the stress levels are through the roof.  Be warned.
bad,The pay scale was horrible and the management was just as bad
bad,Work life balance is encouraged.  Great perks and benefits. Poor salary.
bad,"Fun job, but has its ups and downs.  Direct sales could be an unsafe job depending on location, and I have some crazy stories!"
bad,"This was a difficult workplace with revolving employees.  The amount of knowledge needed to know to complete the daily required activities was immense.  I was let go just short of my peak. I learned an extraordinary amount of material and set it up to have a successful 2nd year after laying the foundation for that success within my first year. "
bad,answer calls about 50 a day helping  costumers .  Comcast makes this much harder with micro mang and high stress enviorment.
bad,"I enjoyed Comcast due to their product, salary, and coworkers. The calls as expected we not generally nice and for 8 to 10 hours a day you were berated by upset customers. My job was to calm them down and offer any help or compensation I could. My strong point was sales. I would monthly exceed my sales goals by over 200%. However, the leadership was hard to grasp because every team of 25-30 people had a team leader as well as a supervisor. Yet a lot of times they were busy monitoring calls and would not get on the phone with a customer and have us tell the customer they weren't available. Also customers would get upset over technicians not showing up on time or at all for appointements. We would ask the supervisors to contact dispatch to see where the technicians were and most times were told the technician said they were there and reschedule. The customers in my opinion weren't treated as well as they should have been. Whenever myself or fellow employees would address this we were told ""it is what it is"". Which coming from a management background and running multiple successful stores knew this to be incorrect and not how customers should be treated."
bad,I enjoyed doing the training for this job but I had a few hiccups with a supervisor who was never there and when I asked for more help with meeting my goals I was let go
bad," worked in Nashville and Murfreesboro offices. all in all, not a good place for career oriented individuals"
bad,"I learned a huge amount about door to door selling. I learned how to engage a mad upset customer who hated Comcast who switched to a competitor and turn them back into a Comcast customer. "
bad,"The best part of my job was successfully helping the customers, I love the benefits package offered by Comcast."
bad,I worked for the company for 13 years i loved my job. They had to make some changes and when the changes were made i was not part of there plan
bad,Petty mangement will nit pick anything and everything in reviews even when they are happy with your work. This destroys employees desire to even try.
bad,"This company has great benefits, however, do not expect to be stable or grow old with Comcast. It's not your professionalism or knowledge they're concerned with, it's completely based on what customers think (which most of your customers will be angry when they call in, making them automatically offended due to poor services). If not that, then you're continually tossed around in the ""numbers"" game, so enjoy it while it lasts. No real skill required to work here however, which is good for those wanting to learn....Good Luck."
bad,Jobs going overseas by outsourcing eventhough Comcast stock prices are the highest theyve ever been. Not concerned about the customer in the call center get them off the phone quick or suffer the wrath of management.
bad,"I worked for this company just shy of two years. This was a sales positions which involved door to door sales. There is nothing in written that says this but they want you to work weekends and evenings. They will work you 7 days straight and tell you you can take off a day later on. Then, try to take a day off later on....good luck. Quota change several times within a one year period. They say that the department will operate in unison but everything is different from the West Palm Beach office and the Broward office. The pay, the quota's, even the equipment if you happen to install (some sales reps will install the equipment themselves which is smater to do because you get a little extra $ for doing it but mainly they did it because the subcontractors were extremely unrelaible)."
bad,Management has no idea whats going on most of the time so you have no idea whats going on all of the time. Benefits were great. Values are set down on paper but not in the real world.
bad,Little or no training very little advancement. Numerous buy-outs and aquisitions short term/long term view for employee advancement is minuscule.
bad,Current typical day at work@ Comcast is the constant redundancy of how important it is to make the numbers/quota.
bad,even if you are qualified for all things needed to fill the position they constantly find ways to get you out... this company has a HIGH turn-over rate
bad,"Calls were timed 9 mins each, and they evaluated performance every monday, management was off and on, there was no sence of a group work only individuales who saw who can best the other"
bad,Needs to improve their equipment product and provide better pricing that last longer then 3 months to 1 year.
bad,"The work is easy but horribly repetitive. Management is not very helpful and they prepare you for this during training by denying you assistance when you need help. Since there is no real accountability you are always getting cursed out by someone else's customer when they don't receive their callback from a manager, which is horrible because most things require a manager and the cycle just continues."
bad,"The company offers a very attractive benefit plan that is very favorable to employees. It is a very fast-pace work environment and most decisions are made on reaction instead of proactive planning. Flexibility is a must as schedules change frequently. You will eat, sleep, and breathe Comcast. There is little time for much else. You work constantly."
bad,"Call centers were pretty bad, i wouldn't wish it on anyone. Employees are not valued and moving up is nearly impossible."
bad,the needs of the business comes first no mater what.
bad,"Love doing the work but to much politics for me. Supervisors have no authority, Just act as puppets."
bad,Worked as an Outbound Sales Rep. for the Commercial accounts of Comcast.
bad,The day starts the moment you set foot on the property. Many times I would be addressing issues as I put my lunch away and while my computer was loading.
bad,"Comcast seems to be at the right place, at the right time. Excellent products. But its a frustrating place to be. Too large. One division doesn't know or care what the other is doing. Talk about customer service, but don't seem to do very well at it."
bad,"Fast Pace,required to sell products,help customer's with Technical,financial and any problem related to their account."
bad,"The work is a grind and very repetitious. After 30 seconds of last phone call, another one comes in. You get penalized on your adherance metric if your on a phone call that runs past your break time. The 3 month paid introductory training doesnt really go into much on info you need to do your job (troubleshooting software & order entry software) The supervisors are spread real thin and dont have any time to show you anything ie just get shat on for not doing your job. Your internal email storage can only hold about 50 emails so forgot about saving anything important that you need. The mentality with supervisors here is ""didnt you get my email on how to do this?"". In other words its a CYA environment, they just send out over 300 emails a day while you can store only about 50. LOL. If your able to upgrade customers levels of service (better tv phone or internet) you can make some real descent cash. You can make much more money than the floor supervisors."
bad,"A company that says they want to change, but never does and entrenched leadership at a regional and local level prevents this from ever getting any traction. Will forever be the company of business as usual, and those that actually do want to improve the customer experience will be chased out for daring to have higher standards."
bad,"The company is as disingenuous as they come. They talk a lot about employee and customer satisfaction, but it is mostly talk. If the customer experience was #1, as they say, they wouldn't make so many changes that upset people (commercials in the guide, inconsistent billing, overseas support agents, etc). They just opened up a huge call center in Mexico City. This is just another act that proves they care more about the bottom line than they do the customer experience. They hire people that ""look the part"" over people that produce. It is all show, smoke and mirrors, and the management is never accountable for anything (they only blame those below them). You can make money here, and if you don't mind keeping your mouth shut and only making positive comments no matter what, then you can do well here."
bad,it was an okay place to work. didn't like the fact that you had to have seniority just to change your hours. otherwise it was a pretty decent place to be
bad,"At Comcast I truly dreaded work everyday. I didn't like the structure they had. They had good benefits, and decent pay. I just wanted to never be at work, the customers I spoke to were horrible. I would have the greatest sense of relief when I was able to leave work. If you like to be treated poorly this job is for you."
bad,If you are conservative and are not scared of telling the truth when asked your opinion this is not the company for you. If you are on salary you will see long days and weekends with a lot of after-hours phone calls.
bad,"They drive you hard. Good benefits but bad management. There are several good positions inside the company, but they block them off for outside workers. Not alot of movement up once you work there. All upper management is brought from outside companies."
bad,I was given a one sheet playbook of symbols for reference on reading Comcast drawings and a trainer that really didn’t want to train anyone.  I asked for other training materials every other week and was told “I’ll see what I can put together and bring it in next week”.  That never happened the entire time I was there.  The Manager never spent more than 30 minutes in 6 months of time showing me anything.  We spent more time going to lunch.
bad,Not much work life balance while working at Comcast.   you have to work at least one weekend day per week for shift requirements. Tough to get vacation time/holidays off.
bad,It was a rough work environment. Management is shady and not trustworthy. It’s an especially dramatic call center environment. If sales is your thing and you don’t mind working overtime and being very manipulative there is money to be made.
bad,"If you are young and without children,  Comcast is a great company to work for. If you have children and want a home this may not be the job for you. The benefits are great but the pay is lousy."
bad,"Great supervisors and core work force willing to help and guide you. It is unfortunate that the company is bent on burying the commtech program. Ever growing metrics and standards make it near impossible to grow with in the company. If you need a job for a year or two that provides cable and internet at a discounted rate with an incredible amount of stress attached, this job is for you."
bad,"Customer services along with cash, checks, credit card transaction payments.  Perform daily cash audits, balance cash receipts/ checks from drawer.  Exchange of  cable equipment if having trouble.  Ensured all customers needs were met, resolved  complaints, performed other duties as assigned"
bad,"Comcast is the most cliquish, biased place that I’ve ever worked.  The team I worked with was like high school kids who decided if you were allowed to be part of their group.  They talked about people behind their backs, took credit for the work of other people and complained about the success of others saying that they had easier projects, fewer challenges and more support. They targeted people over 50 for layoffs regardless of performance."
bad,"If you don’t mind working every weekend till Jesus comes back, then this the place to work. Management has a list of favorites and if you’re not on the list it’s hard to move up."
bad,"The company was recently taken over by Comcast, so this review is with much bias. I can't review it now, as I wouldn't have much good to say. Our culture ""used"" to be like a family, where we had a voice. Even though they project we still do, it doesn't feel like it.The building and people running the site are professional and do their jobs well. We produce a good product. However, many colleagues have been ""cut"" so it's hard to be unbiased. Even my department has been threatened to be cut. While here I learned the meaning of all for one and one for all. Sadly, those days are over."
bad,It’s a sales environment.  They promote sales not for the faint of heart.  Know the product perks get the sale. That’s your only goal.  People were great team environment.
bad,"meetings almost daily that took time out of the field, supervisor will not help with escalated issues if he doesn't want you on his team. there was a lot of favoritism and a lot more attention given to other employees issues similar."
bad,"I enjoyed working for a Comcast for about a year but things are constantly changing which is fine, but I believe the company bites off more than they can chew and are constantly throwing new duties and responsibilities onto us for the same pay and more stress. I spend all my time and energy there to the point where I have absolutely no time to do anything else because the little time I get off I spend it sleeping or just relaxing before I have to get ready for work again. The benefits are amazing, but nothing is worth selling your soul. I love my coworkers and managers, but I've never experienced customers like these, they are bold and rude and for the most part I don't blame them because I've seen the company do shady stuff but we take all the hits since we work in a retail store in person."
bad,Will run you ragged then complain about quality. Coworkers are great. also local management good  Senior management the pits Wish i couldve seen it til the end but got a better job
bad,"Theres nothing really positive to say about my department at Comcast. We are hired under the pretense in our job description which is repair but then after hire, now they implement selling packages and having a quota in addition to repair.. If you dont meet the quota, you're terminated cause you didnt meet goal. Also we also recieve unfair reprimands for (FCR) First Call Resolution (customer calling back), which employees may have no control over, even after you've went over all steps, options, availabilities, and problem solving to make sure nothing was left out....craziness!"
bad,"after spending 10+ years at this place what i can say is the benefits are great but the workplace is the polar opposite. too much drama. cliques galore. advancement is a joke as the openings go through a recruiting section of comast instead of talking to the manager or supervisor. management doesnt listen to its front line people and it seems like departments work against each other instead of together."
bad,"day starts from your house or the office. work orders go thru company phone and gives you all info needed to complete job. problems started when i was relocated to another office ""closer"" to my house. i was told that the relocation was so i could work jobs no more than 15mins from my house, well that turned out to be a lie because i started driving around 2hours every morning in traffic and across town to jobs when other tchs lived considerably closer to said jobs. work orders give you a 2hr window to show up but if you showed up to a job scheduled between 2-4 at 3:50 the office would pop you with another 2-4 which you'll miss but they dont care, they consider it helping the fellow techs in the field. However, the missed time frame goes on your record and causes you to be overlooked for promotion or raises. To top it all off most techs are lazy and do the least amount of work possible which leaves the customer irritated due to poor craftsmanship or ongoing cable issues"
bad,"Comcast offers great pay for a call center and great benefits. The job is very difficult due to Comcast's unethical business practices, terrible management, and horrendous software used day-to-day."
bad,"Receive incoming calls from customers, access and verify customer records. troubleshoot technical difficulties with TV reception, Broadband Internet interruption and Home Phone issues, Troubleshoot over the phone to a resolution or schedule a technician, recommend upgrades.of services,"
bad,"Extremely stressful!!! Couldn't keep employees because of stress and unrealistic stats. Tried to make up for it with free tv's or game systems but nothing made up for a cut of commission by 3x... management was horrible and they could care less about any work/life balance.. "
bad,Stress and changes.  If customer service is your strong point it’s not for you. Things will change constantly with little or no consideration for employees as being expendable is an understatement.  You’re a number. Literally you memorized your number.
bad,"Decent environment. Friendly atmosphere. Stressful customer base but that is a part of the customer care position. Wages are too low. Finally, termination due to not achieving sales goals after all possible sales were removed from the repair queue. This includes those customers with repair needs and sales interests routed to a sales queue overseas instead of the repair queue and only sent to the repair queue after any possible sales interests were exhausted. The sales expectations were in no way changed or adjusted to reflect the purposeful change in call routing to insure no sales were in the repair call queue."
bad,"I was at Comcast for almost 5 years. I was excited when I first started working for the company but towards the middle of my time there too many changes were being made. Now I understand that changes has to be be made within a company but the changes that were being made were to really change the rate of the employee. The company is not considerate of the customers, their structure is not balanced, and the employees are more stressed out than anything. There are more employees that are intoxicated or under the influence when arriving then sober just to make it through the day. People were being fired for no reason, good enough. The standards are set High as for an employee, almost too high to achieve. It almost makes it impossible to reach the goal that they're asking. The so-called good employees were being treated less than. Management act like they don't know what's going on with the company and don't have any true answers as to what is really going on within the company. It's impossible to move up because there are so many excuses being made. I have a master's degree and I tried for management several times and was declined. They make you go through some career advancement program to be considered for higher positions regardless of your educational background. But if you go through this process you pretty much hang yourself on the line and be fired because the expectations are way too high. If you slip up slightly you're pretty much walking yourself out the door which is ridiculous. Within the 5 years I work there I've gotten to know a lot of employees of which the conversations"
bad,"The work is grueling, upper management doesn't care about staff; only care about metrics being met, by any means necessary; job is threatened if metrics aren't met. They don't tolerate any excuses about metrics, including the fact that certain areas are still using wires and tools from 15-20 years ago; they don't make updates unless you're in a rich area."
bad,"This job is a streful job to begin with however the monthly stats and constant breathing down your neck doesn’t make it any better. Things are constantly changing at this company which is great but the changes are rarely communicated in a timely manor. Most the time you find out about the changes after the occur. "
bad,Program designed to increase frontline recognition which prior to was not consistent or structured. This was a great idea to have monthly award ceremonies and for other employees to be made aware of how their co workers were appreciated.
bad,"This job is only good during training and maybe 2/3 months once your out on the floor alone. You deal with irate customers all day long, your numbers going up and down , policies changing all the time. So supervisors and great and some are as efficient as the others. Good incentives, but not worth the stress."
bad,Comcast I was there for 1 year and some months I must say the beginning was awesome but that was just training. When I started I was a billing rep then a few months later they added on us to take technical calls as well. Then it became stressful calls were back to back SOO MUCH micro management they’re always complaining about the aux but want us to satisfy the customers they if you have a family this is not the job for you or if you’re young when you get hired on you have no choice but to choose from 12-9PM or 2:30-11PM  (U WILL HAVE NO LIFE) and that’s when the call volume gets high they claim they were going to do so much as far as a mandorty shift bid but guess what they canceld it because the people that was there over 10 years were going to quit because they could’ve possibly lost there 9-5 this is a greedy company and the directors of it change so many things without even tell the supervisors or employees
bad,Comcast was a decent job but as time went on the culture changed.  Sales metrics above allWould not recommend if honest else was promoted even for people who are Technical Services.  Lying to customers while not official policy is advised in training and ignored by management.
bad,"Comcast offers a lot of POTENTIAL for making money. Thing is, NONE of your customers want to buy new things or upgrade. 90% are coming in for issues. So you have to manipulate if you want to make sales, on top of the fact that you WILL be fired if you do not make sales within 5 months. The coworkers are ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. They all have an attitude problem, (which you dont notice until 5-6 months in) and take their issues out on other coworkers. Half of them take breaks when they arent supposed to, leaving us severely understaffed. Coworkers are favorited by managers and given different training opportunities compared to those who arent favorites. Honestly, AVOID WORKING HERE AT ALL COSTS."
bad,the stars have to align for payment to be rendered. the unfortunate cancel/rekey nature of the company lends itself to cut throat employees greedily stealing from each other and a management team inadequate to remedy the situation
bad,"company provides great benefits and training to employees but due to its size and policies it is extremely difficult for front line employees and leaders  to provide the current level of service to customers, the company, peers, and employees"
bad,"When I worked there, we were talking over service for central IL and had no training on there products before the calls starting coming in. I had a manager that would never answer my questions regardless of how many times I asked."
bad,"Comcast just recently decided to switch to 10 hour shifts 4 days a week. They will not be 4 straight days either unless you have been at the company for many many years. They do not promote within to the people that are qualified for the position rather who they like. There shifts use to be a choice as in a 10 hour or 8 hour but now residential techs only have 10 hour schedules and then when you get into the specialty positions there is only two 8 hour shifts with the rest being 10 hours. Rather than be understanding for certain schedules and employees legitimate needs they just give the people that sit in the same spot for 10 years priority. They recently where awarded top 100 places to work, but only because they lied to the employees and told them they cared about the work home balance when honestly all they cared about was making the top 100."
bad,i dont want to write anything here because it would be fruitless. As a result I will just type the fact that I don't want to write anything here so I can move on.
bad,There is no consistency between departments.  You can either be in a cohesive environment that will allow you to go to work and enjoy your day and be highly productive or be in a department with no accountability and everyone works as hard as they can to not do their job.
bad,"Poor management and Nestorian runs rampant. You want to advance family members only. Customers are the worst they scream and cuss you out Comcast is not supportive. I hated all 4 years that I worked there. Too many stats to hit to get paid bonus they do this on purpose. The agents that hit monthly qouto are the ones that stay pad, and cheat."
bad,"Comcast only cares about stock values leaving employees to become nothing but a decimal point. Although Comcast gave me a place to launch my career, cultivate my skills, and flourish in the business realm, the lack of care for the human inside of me instead of how much revenue I created really crippled the job environment and demotivated everyone."
bad,I had a poor manager. I couldn't thrive. I wouldn't recommend the location that I worked at. I didn't think it was conducive to the goals I was trying to achieve.
bad,"If not compliant with forced sales will be in jeopardy of loss of employment. "
bad,Comcast is a decent company to work for. Limited trading on the job but it was simple. Hours were low but room for growth after 6 months to a year. Not fast enough.
bad,"Comcast as a whole, isn't a bad company...despite what people think. Now, the role of customer service in Comcast is a nightmare. The current director, who is from the south came up to the pacific northwest and is a joke. Caters holiday parties to kids and treats the agents like dirt and the agents are treated as kids with little snacks and not real food to sustain the mental stress that is put upon them. The pay is lack luster for what front line agents get put through. The pay isn't bad by any means but should start higher and at a livable wage. The supervisors and managers have to play to the company, not caring for their agents and career advancement is lacking in all aspects unless the scorecard is lied and people get their feet kissed."
bad,"Get to work clock into the phones, log into computer and computer systems, begin to take calls, deal with need to get customer off the phone quickly or you will face consequences. Training did not cover basic knowledge they assume even people who have not worked in a call center will know the proper procedures."
bad,Worked at Comcast for many years.   Recent changes in regional management soured many outstanding employees on the company. No clear direction from one month to next on direction of  company.  For many years it was a great place to work.
bad,Comcast made my life so difficult to enjoy!! I felt like I was in prison & it was so cut throat all time. Way too much competition to sit comfortably. I wish it was more family oriented!
bad,I would not recommend this place to work to someone who want to advance. This is not a place to work if you want stability or to be stress free. This is a stressful job and can become over whelming. Tender on the job means very little.
bad,"Customers hate Comcast, and I never knew why fully until I worked for them. Simply put, the company is incapable of seeing that constantly having their low paid technicians under the gun does NOT provide a good experience for their customers, especially since the customer will also probably have a bad experience on the phone as well."
bad,"It is a great job for someone without a family, if you have a family the compensation doesn't match the time required of you. There's a lot of perks and someone with the disposable time will enjoy a career and advancement."
bad,"going door to door, lots of rejection and long hot summer hours. "
bad,"Spend every day rewiring homes for cable .Job is very physically demanding, spend every day in 100+ degree attics. You work alone on every install during normal work hours"
bad,it's not all bad! Money is GRREAT! benefits are great...Environment is not the best..Coworkers make the day better...I make it work because i have bills! money is to be made!
bad,"All the PR fluff about how Comcast cares is nonsense. The values the company claims to uphold do not match the company's business practices. The pay and benefits are great, especially for the area, but Comcast does't treat its employees any better than it treats its customers. Every change takes power away from the agents to do their job and just frustrates the customers as they're being told we can't help them.  Job security is based on metrics that are monitored by systems that are constantly breaking, and the bottom line is Comcast wants us to sell you something and get you off the phone asap."
bad,"I never personally had any issues with staff.  However, lower performing agents are ignored and mistreated.  Reports filed to HR do nothing. It was upsetting.  If you can handle being yelled at on a call floor in public for speaking to another supervisor because yours was indisposed then have at it.  The pay is great though."
bad,"loos to none management."
bad,"I won't say much but I will say this, they have been sued twice for not promoting non-white personnel."
bad,"It does pay very much, but the atmosphere isnt bad. Co-workers are fun ad friendly."
bad,"the top brass needs to care more about the reality of of the front line sales , than their stock options.  Considering the consistent high wash out rate, it is clear they don't care"
bad,Comcast is a tough place to work... call centers are stressful as it is with Comcast reputation customers can be too hard to deal with they have great benefits including Insurance and courtesy services but their management is tough to deal with extreme corporate mentality it's there  way or the highway...they seem like they care but it when it comes down to it they are large corporation and you are just one Of literally millions
bad,"The job itself was great, management is awful and leadership skills. The is unfairness and favoritism which is seen all the time. All this was seen in the Livermore office not while I was a technician."
bad,"Potential to make a lot of money, good benefits, and time off. very high pressure sales with difficulty to secure installation requests with customers."
bad,"Management focuses too much on catering to current employee's families. Friendly environment. However, forces contractors to go through hoops to attempt to obtain job security."
bad,"Enjoyed the job at first, but then they started in bound call time limitations that were extremely stressful! Always comparing you to everyone else."
bad,"Comcast was typical of your run of the mill contact center job.  Lots of different types of personalities, as to be expected.  but I felt that they could have been a little bit more picky with the types of people they hired."
bad,"Work was salary + commission so taking many calls could result in more commission opportunities."
bad,"Wouldn't be so awful, if Comcast would get with the times. Antiquated everything. Terrible work culture. No one listens to input, yet they laud themselves as employee centric."
bad,"Good place to work with; the management at certain facilities are a work in progress.  There is a high stress culture that does not get better with the management focus only on self promotion.  A more customer friendly & service related management team would benefit the employees & customers in the immediate/long term life of the business."
bad,When I applied for this position I was told it would be tech support. On the first day of work I was informed there would be sales metrics I had to meet and that I would be handling billing too. I felt many things that happened at Comcast were sprung on us. Information always changed within the company and policies would have multiple interpretations. When I was first hired I was told I would have Tuesdays and Thursdays off and my schedule would be 3pm to midnight. I was informed this would only be temporary and I would be allowed to bid on a different shift shortly after training. Whenever it came time for a shift bid something always happened to where the bid wasn't going to happen. After over a year of being on the same schedule I never did get to bid on a new schedule. Before I left I was told schedules probably wouldn't change until August 2017 and I started working at Comcast in July 2015.
bad,"We started the day with a Team performance review. Next we had Team meeting/training for about an hour, to make sure everyone knew promotions and how to use any equipment. Next it was Prep time, so we could set up any teams and territory. Door to Door work for 4 hours per work day was how we got paid. All of the time preparing, so we could make as many sales as possible. Lastly Team Check out to get preliminary numbers for the next day."
bad,"Management only cares about the bottom line and not its sales employees. They micromanage you but claim not to ""babysit"" you. My manager in particular is very bi-polar and is very seldom helpful. "
bad,"PROS: Good Pay, Good Health Benefits, 401k, Quarterly Bonuses,  40hrs vacation (yearly), employees who know what they're doing help you out."
bad,"There is no shortage of new technologies in use but advancement requires both high technical skill and the ability to play politics well. They do not communicate the requirement of politicking for advancement, instead they point to a path of technical achievement and then decide if they like you or not."
bad,typical day was trying to beat out the next team with the most sales to compete with flat screen TV's or concert tickets. intervening with a large variety of different cultures
bad,I was in an outside sales role where I solicited sales from prospective customers about new products. Typical day you were on your own and managed your own time.
bad,Houston call center is Ghetto culture centered if your not ghetto or kiss tail you have no chance other wise Comcast is a good company to work for great benefits.
bad,"This company didn't want to pay you for the work that you performed.  "
bad,"Yelled and cursed at by customers, yelled at by superiors... stressful. Forced work hours, disregard to faily care plans/child care."
bad,tedious work; commission structure changes all the time to make less money; no job security; easy work; shift bids are decent if you get a good shift but terrible if you're stuck on a terrible shift; not really allowed to use the restroom when needed because you have to use your breaks for that; supervisors are great but management was terrible
bad,"A typical day at Comcast is back to back calls with complaints you aren't able to resolve. My coworkers are the best and for the most part very supportive. The hardest part of the job is meeting numbers, that's all they care about and trying to make customers happy because they have already had an horrible experience is almost impossible because of the company's bad reputation. Supervisors don't like taking escalations and they pretty much want you to say whatever you need to de-escalate the call even if that includes telling a lie."
bad,"I was a supervisor over installation and service.  They overworked us, expected a seven day a week work week.  My salary broken down to an hourly wage, I had technicians making more than I was for supervising a group of 10-17 technicians."
bad,"Management is unprepared, non-skilled, and absent to advise and help new Employees during the 2 month training transition.  Manager is always home, never appears except numbers meeting.  Training for quotes and submissions are a joke--it changes every week and only one person out of state helps the entire region."
bad,"i've learned a lot since I've joined that department, mainly because of my thirst for knowledge when taking on any project or task.  The environment is for ever changing- one day we are taking on a task one way and the next day it is being handled totally different than what was communicated previously.  Lots of stress in this position with MICRO managing"
bad,"No Security anymore, they outsourced everything overseas."
bad,Management did not care about their employees.  Their metric system was horrible.  Overall a bad experience and I stayed there far to long.
bad,At Comcast the motto is “It is what it is” accept and tolerate the inaccurate information giving and the lack of training. Don’t try to improve the process as it is frown upon by management. Everyone is afraid of being laid off or fired. It is a revolving door. I've seen so many people cry there over the stress they put on their employees.
bad,"I answered the phone and assisted customers with minor questions about their bill, changing their packages, assisting with getting their tv services restored, and scheduling appointments if needed."
bad,"The company makes it hard to do your job. If you want to work here help people, this is not the position for you. The work days are busy with back to back calls from people whom have been lied to and pushed to the edge by overseas call centers. The management presents an open atmosphere, but they rarely make changes to support the staff. The best part of the job are your co-workers...people who understand that we are being bamboozled. The pay is okay relative to other jobs in the area, but its not worth the stress."
bad,Heavy  workload with minimal support in alleviating workload.
bad,Great company but the sales department needs project management
bad,"Great benefits, good co-workers, easy job, long hours, management unfair."
bad,very competitive but a great place to work.  the hardest part was going to school while working at comcast
bad,"I have not been happy at Comcast.  Very old fashion with ideas.  Expect you to work long hours.  Upper management has no problem yelling at their employees.  Comcast does have a nice quarterly bonus package and decent benefits. Nice having free cable, phone, and internet.  But not worth the headaches go through every day at work.  Was promised through the NETO policy could work 2 days a week from home, but that never happened through the finance group."
bad,"For Comcast I would say that working there feels like you are welcome all the time. I loved the benefits as well, such as free services and good health insurance. The only thing bad about it was the fact that their stats they needed from each employee was a little hard to reach. No matter how hard I tried I always seemed to miss them by a bit. Other than that I would recommend this place."
bad,I mostly enjoyed the fact that we were recognized by the achievements that we received from the job.
bad,"Was not a great place  to work. Management never let you forget they thought temporary workers were beneath them.Was not provided telephones, but they expected you to call customers on the phone in the break room! The new building in Center City is drab and boring-every floor looks the same! The lobby is the most exciting part of the whole place!"
bad,I was happy coming to work despite knowing that I was indirectly threatened everyday.  Job security it wasn't. Between management job security was a joke.
bad,"Comcast recently opted to go the route of a Center of Exellence. "
bad,have Good benefits. but do not care about the Employee. Comcast have a very high turn over rate because they do not try to work with you. they onlycare about making the sale.
bad,A typical day is very fast paced and unpredictable. learned how to handle a multitude of personalities and problems in never ending changing environment. Management was not on the same page. My co-workers and I have the same goals. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistancy of management. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a customer happy.
bad,I'm not sure about other locations but the career path in our area effectively ends at the ComTech III level.
bad,Typical day is learning to keep up with the day to day changes in technology. Can be a stressful place to work if you are not fit for constant change.
bad,Comcast as a company has alot of inconsistency when it comes to an employees training and job performance expectations but does offer great benefits and extra incentives depending on what department you are employed in.
bad,All they care about is money and not what the customer wants.
bad,Ok company but the scheduling was crazy. Every three months had to bid for schedule. great compensation as far as incentives.
bad,Working at the call center is stressful. The management always seemed stress and they reflect their stress on you. There are a couple of managers that have worked as call center reps before and understand what you are going through but most of them have not work a day as a rep. They push for more sales instead of fixing the problem and you will most likely hear from the same angry over and over. The benefits are great while working there. Free cable and internet service and the medical is good if you are single.
bad,"Door to door sales isnt for everyone, but for people like me who can work 6-7 days and give 110% and can close sales very well can make a great living out of it. Weather makes it hard, the management are horrible and there is no support for the sales group from Comcast as a whole making it very difficult to work and get things done but we must to get paid and make a living."
bad,"A typical day at work would mean to be on the phone constantly solving billing issues, repairs for cable, and appointments for a technician."
bad,Management is trying to run the company without thinking about their employees. They contradict themselves constantly to make themselves look better to upper management even when they are completely wrong for their own bonuses and advancement.
bad,you are constantly calling customers all day trying to sale additional services they do not want. you are require to hit a goal every month. if you don't there are consequences that can eventually lead to termination.
bad,"In the beginning everything will be great. You will become a number you will be expected to make everyone happy even though customers treat you like garbage Your metrics are graded and your raise will be graded accordingly , it will be your fault that the equipment they gave you failed,It will be your fault that something else did not work even though that is not why you went there. Every supervisor does things their own way"
bad,"There was a staggering amount of supervisors, most of whom were knowledgeable. In addition to the stress of the job, that of working with customers on billing questions, concerns, and cost complaints, the last thing I needed was weekly coachings on how I could do better and something called ""S4X,"" an overly engineered and picky quality system that was near impossible to meet. There's an overall buzz of stress and some amazingly tough reps standing up to it all. I wouldn't say happiness was high, but I'll admit you can't beat the benefits or cable/internet employee packages."
bad,The team was very good to work on with and have good life work balance.The job opportunity was excellent and good life work balance.Management was very good
bad,Not worth the stress constant looking over your back & wondering if you have a job the next day! The pay started off good with commission but 4 years in you go from making $2k on commission to $500.
bad,"Most of the people, especially management, is nice. The job I showed up for is not the one I applied for. There are apparently very low standards in the hiring process-not even a drug test. And it shows in the unprofessionalism of a lot of employees. I even lost a customer one day because he said it sounded like Mardi Gras in the background. The systems you need to do your job rarely worked in the time I was there. Your bonuses are based on phone hours, but if their systems don't work, you get screwed."
bad,You will find several nice people here but many of them are lifers and have not moved on through the company. The career progression is stiff and they expect you to hold that job for an extended period of time.
bad,"Ffriendly coworkers, company in constant change and restructuring. Alot of turnover. Sales management wants to create shark tank environment- internal competition, no database structure. poor marketing strategies. ""Don't like it-leave"" management attitude."
bad,buen ambiente laboral pero muy poca oportunidad de crecimiento
bad,"If you don't have family already working there, your a low paid under used peon. Only ""The Teachers Pet"" type workers get raises and they aren't worth bragging about. After 7 years and Streamlining their warehouse to putout twice the product, you get less than $0.50 raise."
bad,Comcast is an ok start up company buy they have no growth in career. No good pay raise no cost of living increase.... AND  Favoritism!!!! Will never reach maximum pay our shop gets treat differently than other shops
bad,It’s hard to sell with integrity when the managers want you to bend the truth or withhold information from the customer in order to make the sale. Classroom training is entirely different from what the actual job entails and is misleading. I will say the benefits and pay are great. If you’re motivated and have a positive attitude to do what it takes to make money than I would recommend this position if not then I would seek employment elsewhere that isn’t soul sucking.
bad,This company puts forth unrealistic demands and does nothing to help with a work/life balance.  Heaven forbid there is an emergency that happens.  You have to jump through hoop after hoop to get it covered.  I don't recommend this company at all.
bad,Horrible culture. Conservative management that does not care about the work life balance of the employees. This was my first job out of college and I do not recommend.
bad,"I worked as a Customer Service Rep and Comms Fulfillment Specialist and it is some of the most soul crushing work I've ever done. At a certain point, you will stop caring because your managers don't care and if you get too useful, not only will they hold you back because they don't want to lose you, but they won't promote you further in that department. At the very least, Comcast has very awesome benefits and that is the only thing that I missed."
bad,Definitely show appreciation on job performance monthly. First to be updated and enjoy new services. Flexible hours and triple pay for working the Holidays
bad,"It took me 3 months to be onboard, from the first phone interview to the 1st day  and before my 3 months on a Dic 14 day lay off the whole department. The training was good, my whole time was hitting the numbers and they promised better turf and better commission structure for the following year but that never happened. I won't be part the company never again."
bad,"Comcast is out to run you crazy do not I repeat DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY , the systems never work to sell mobile phones. retail 360 is what they use and trust me you'll loose more sales than gain dealing with that system. they want you to drive sales, but never give you the tools to accomplish what is asked. management is just as lost as the employees. its not a place you can see yourself working more than a year,"
bad,"Clicky, supervisor did not exhibit leadership qualities and showed blatant favoritism. Co-workers were disrespectful. Environment was cold and loud. Met some very nice people, but that was not the norm. Raises are small, expectations very high, little training. "
bad,"Comcast will definitely entice you with fantastic benefits and very competitive pay for your area.  The problem is they will at any given moment ""re-org"" any department they see fit and you now no longer have a job.  Worked there for 30 years, sorry, you're no longer needed!  They state the ""C"" in Comcast stands for change, as if that's a good thing, when it just means they will change your pay scale any time they see fit, change your work environment any time they see fit and change your job status from employed to unemployed any time they see fit!"
bad,"I worked for Comcast for 19 years. I started as a service technician, advanced to maintenance, and further advanced to construction coordinator.  There were some opportunities for growth within the company.  They provided a strong compensation and benefit package.  I had many great opportunities do grow and learn through what I did."
bad,Inbound calls very stressful very monitored for low pay biggest benefit with the free cable benefits other than that I would say it's a great start out job for high-school graduate
bad,"very fast pace & competitive environment. You had to compete for bonuses, shifts, & off days. The people I worked with were very happy. We enjoyed potlucks & Birthday parties"
bad,"Hours are not great, fixed. Company offers great benefits. The culture is like high school. The company overall is great for employees. Not customers."
bad,"In a year and a half, I had eight separate supervisors, between forced shift bids and a supervisor who went on leave with no backup. Forced annual shift bids to reward high performers serve to separate teams and contribute to wrecking the family culture Comcast espouses. Forcing agents to subject all callers, including ones who are misrouted to sales,  when they need billing, technical support, or other departments to a pushy sales process creates discomfort for agents and disgruntled customers. The people who work there are amazing, but there's not a point in building relationships that are just going to end during the next shift bid."
bad,"working at a call center was very stressful in sales department because you didnt always have sales calls coming through on your phone line so you would have to try to convince every customer they needed something they didn't just so you don't get a zero for that call because you didn't make the sale. pitch every line of business they had to offer on every call (even if the customer asks for only internet) or else it can lead to a written warning. so with every customer, you are obligated to be pushy even if its not within the customers need or budget.  the compensation pay is always changing in ways that aren't benefiting the employee to make money."
bad,"Take calls from customers with service issues "
bad,"you needed to be greedy and bold to succeed in this environment.  you needed to only help people if it fit into your metrics scale, other wise you would face write ups and termination."
bad,Job is very demanding decent benefits but you have constant changes in management that cause issues with your job.  Only if you're desperate to get a job.
bad,Comcast has great benefits and great paid vacations. The paid is below average and it is very hard to grow within the company. It is a full time job at 5 days a week with 8 hour days. When you start the paid is ok but they do not give you much money for your raise. Just a few cents.
bad,The training was more of role playing and not with the system and applications used. New hires felt they were just thrown out to the wolves. Comcast has good benefits but there's too much favoritism with management and lack of job security. The scoring is totally unreasonable.
bad,"After years of working for the company, I ended up saying to myself ""Is this it? Is this all this place has to offer on a daily basis?"" I grew tired of lying to customers on a daily basis and dealing with the fallout of terrible customer account reps making my job increasingly harder due to lack of communication or understanding of each others responsibilities and services."
bad,if you like stress this is your job. if you like management that say they care what you do but dont then this is for you.i would get up and start my day with messages left from customers issues then about 10 i would be at office or in field. i would work with no lunch or breaks longer than 10 min because you will be written up  i would work till 8 be home at 9 and still answer calls. i worked 7 days a week taking calls even vacations i was on call
bad,Comcast had high expectations and did not care about it's employees or it's customers.  You definitely felt like you were less than a number.  I did have an exceptional supervisor but that was it.
bad,"Monotonous work schedule with strict rules and quotas. The benefits were great if you're into television and insurance compensation.  Policies were against the consumer, however, including forcing workers to provide sales pitches to customers who called in for repairs on other services.  How rude."
bad,Comcast was very sales driven and if you are not into sales this is not the job for you. Every positions requires sales no way around it. Your schedule changes quarterly also so you may go from days to afternoons in a flash.
bad,"I enjoyed my job when I first began, but ended up having to go on medical leave for awhile. When I tried to transition back into work, they were highly unorganized and had no idea what to do with me in regards to training, transitioning or anything. I didn't even have a supervisor for the first week I attempted to come back. I was so stressed out from the way they interacted with me coming back that it made it impossible to feel comfortable coming back into the job."
bad,Very stressful due to the fact that customers were allowed to verbally abuse customer account executives. Frequent shift changes didn't suit home life style.
bad,"Going door to door can be fun yet challenging. Just be prepared to get cussed at a lot. Not a lot of people like Comcast. When a sale is made, its very fun."
bad,I was injured on the job while working at Comcast and they fired me.  I won awards for the work I did at Comcast. After some time I was eventually able to move up.  It was difficult to make them understand that doing the job right took time.
bad,"Job security is OK but advancement opportunities are far and few between. Senior and mid level management tend to treat lower and mid level employees like numbers, the general culture leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,"i was really enjoying employment here. great environment, great people. only problem was i was let go when i was sick and instructed to stay home for a week by a doctor"
bad,"for the amount of work to be required of you, you are not compensated too much. Very unorganized. There is a great group that you can call your team and friends."
bad,"Because of the high visibility and name recognition, it makes for an easier sale. Management was supportive but, often lacked the ability to get things done. Mainly everything gets bottlenecked."
bad,"The company would be awesome if they revamp the management. They show lots of favoritism which can quickly block any promotion you are qualified for. They have excellent benefits, and the pay is nice as well. The call center goals are too high which can effect your daily performance. The open door policy is not open door. If you report anyone especially a supervisor, you will be retaliated against. They will do all they can to help you get terminated."
bad,regular customer service job. Mean customers very stressful!! Inbound call center management not to good. Bonuses were a plus the company had nice parties.
bad,"the hardest part about the job was trying to help customer but sometimes it was out of our hands to do anything to help a customer."
bad,They weren't very good about working with their employees when if they have any family issues that arise in life. Nor do they care when you need to take a day off to care for said family member.
bad,Had fun working on a lot of technical projects with smart people. If you have any good technical skills you will enjoy working for Comcast!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Fun Place great benefits work life balance great leadership the training is awesome and all the company perks. The pay is fair
bad,"love the people i worked with, was with the company for a while, was able to do different things and learn a lot. they had ping pong tables, it was enjoyable, they have a lounge, gym."
bad,"I was working with Comcast in the business department and it was not a great experience. Management did not seem very involved and the agents were not held accountable for being rude on the phones to customers. Additionally, advancement (Even with prior experience) was denied unless you work at least 1 year on the phones first which is unacceptable to someone qualified for a leadership or other position."
bad,I worked for comcast in the call center for almost a year. I worked second shift and it took up most of my time personal life. you have to work weekends and the same hours during holidays. very few people had first shifts and they literally monitor everything you do. customers were extremly rude and you had to basically read from a script. i would never work in comcast call center again.
bad,"A typical workday is constantly busy and each call presents a new set of challenges. I learned a lot about Comcast products and services as well as customer service. Most of the time you will be de-escalating customers who are either unsatisfied with the product(s) or  simply need their bill explained. The coworkers are wonderful, everyone is very helpful and fun to be around. They allow you to express yourself however you'd like as long as you can maintain a professional demeanor while assisting customers which was very nice. The hardest part of the job was the hours and a strict adherence to break times and rarely getting vacation or sick leave. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the benefits and the employees."
bad,"Poor customer service and a culture that will not fix it.  Management attitiude that just move on to next customer.  "
bad,"I did not feel human working at Comcast, and I was not proud to be part of an organization that is Publicly despised. Your bathroom breaks are practically scheduled and honestly a monkey could do the job. It's just a miserable job and you do the exact same thing over and over again, kind of like the movie Ground Hog Day."
bad,Great job stability but not much room for advancement. It's especially frustrating when your supervisor can not speak proper English.
bad,the way they treated us on the way out was terrible/ while working here at comcast t hought the company was great they made sure you had the correct equipment and trained you probably
bad,"I've never worked anywhere like this before, and not meant to be in a good way. It got to the point where I would have panic attacks and my desk on a daily basis because of the stress of working for this company. The way that the customers are treated by many of the representatives that you then have to resolve is ridiculous. Would not want to work here again because of this. Especially having to deal with all of the abuse from the customers for only the compensation they provide. Definitely not enough in my opinion."
bad,"Benefits were great, but morale was low.  Leadership failed to keep morale high.  They ended up closing this office and shipping the Customer Service work out of state."
bad,i answer calls from customer who have questions regarding their account review account with customer and explain the charges to them up sell products to customers research any issues that may have been applied in error to their account. i enjoy working with my customer and making sure they have the best services for their needs
bad,"I work in retention Comcast corp is a great corporation to work for they do take care of their employees regarding  benefits but retention is the lowest paid position with the most work to do. management is nice but the  some of leadership staff was either unorganized, micro managed to death or just lacked familiarity with the systems which should be a requirement to graduate form training or to be a supervisor in my opinion. My co workers were a blessing to be around and yes Comcast is very diverse. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers and ensuring that they leave with a happy experience vs  the negative experience that most of the customers call in with"
bad,"High-pressure quota-based sales position.  Excellent benefits and good pay for a company on the rise.  Company has significantly high quotas (ie; in our division of 27 reps, 4 are at quota).  Ultimately, very bad work/life balance and ultimately not a great fit for my young family."
bad,Stressful job that doesn't pay well for what you do. Supervisors that show up twice a week and don't attempt to coach or mentor agents. Somewhat hit or miss on career progression and who you know.
bad,"7 minute handle time to let the customer vent, calm them down, keep them as a customer, go over billing, find a package that fits their needs and close the call.  Impossible."
bad,"Working at Comcast was a complete headache. They don't properly train you to be prepared for new policies, they don't inform you of changes in pricing for customers or even advertisement that customers see. The managers show favoritism to the best sellers and give their behinds to those not up to par. Instead of working to help improve those not up to par, they'd rather chase you away."
bad,The company is all over the place and makes up new policy at the last minute.
bad,"Very busy high enegry work place that is full of daily incentives,management is great and the job is fairly easy"
bad,"Theirs only so much your managers can do, the people up the ladder always seem to of made it difficult for them to give us the go in the sales department. We stood around waiting for someone to tell us things were ok most of the time, studied about product more than sold. Its commission, you get paid or you dont, pretty much, Job security is not good, high turnover rate."
bad,just ok not really a lot of room for moving up unless someone dies
bad,"Working 8 hour shifts w/1hr lunch, taking inbound calls, assisting customer's with billing inquiries, cancelling services, downgrading, upgrading, seasonal holds, and escalating issues to be resolved."
bad,generated leads to upgrade existing customers to additional services.
bad,"I am convinced the South Florida region does not want quality people. They only promote the suck-ups and brown nosers, which ride off the coat tails of the hard working individuals that make the place run and hold it together. I feel I am over used and overlooked and I am taking my talents and skills elsewhere."
bad,Ok company to work for. Wrking for this company helped me improve my listening and leadership skills. The hardest part about this job was the managment and they way certain situations were handled
bad,"Benefits were great but, the rate of pay is short. Their room for advancement was almost impossible to achieve. As you work up to the next level, there are many obstacles to overcome which prevent you from reaching that next level. Some people never get to level 4 because of this, some technicians have been there for about 10 years and still not reached level 4 status. You get just 1 written report and that will prevent you from raises, job advancement, or location change, it also comes with a minimum 1 yr probation / restriction."
bad,"the pay was good, but there is little downtime, and advancement is only availiable when someone leaves, which can take awhile, the position was outsourced out of state, which we were given no warning of said layoffs"
bad,"Heavy phone 95% of day was on phone. Lots of customer interaction. Did everything from billing, sales to trouble shooting. What I most learned was how to deal with difficult people and de-escalate the angry caller. I most enjoyed the variety of people I worked with, meaning both my co-workers and my customers. It was a multi-cultural call center and I really can say I enjoyed the respect that was given to all individuals at this company. The hardest part of the job was that this company asked a lot out of their employees as far as holidays, weekends and overtime for weeks on end and employee loyalty. It got to the point, that I would be burnt out, just exhausted."
bad,I think that the company is great within itself. Working at a call center is very stressful because you are dealing with different types of personalities on the daily basis.
bad,"One of my first sales positions out of college. I enjoyed my team, and we traveled from a number of different locations."
bad,Worked for Comcast 18 years and sacrified many extra hours and missed family events fo what I thought would futher my career. But while this is appreciated in the short term it means nothing in the long term when downsizing and consolidation take place.
bad,"When I started this position, the focus of it was to support customers with their services and devices. Since then, the reps have been asked to not support WiFi at all, or any significant trouble shooting. Instead, they are suppose to check the basics, and if that doesn't solve it, to roll a truck or submit a ticket for someone else to address it. Then after the basic troubleshooting, we are asked to acquire a valid email, and required to try to sell a new line of service. If you don't sell a certain amount of ""New Lines of Business"", you will be put on a performance contract, and eventually let go if you can't sell that amount."
bad,"A typical day of work for me would be as follows; I held team meetings, which composed of 7+ sales reps that I have personally hired, trained, and interviewed. I prepared the schedule, collected work orders, and went over sales pitches and closes to prepare them for the upcoming week. Afterwards, I would meet with the client to discuss the invoice and the upcoming week. Every week I submitted payroll, as well as updates to the company. From Thursday-Sunday I would train these sales representatives and go into the retail stores to talk to management about their progress from week to week."
bad,The company is a good place to work. There are a lot of diverse people employed.
bad,"I had issues but overall it's a good job, everything else was cool. Nice perks like internet cable and phone. Management has its favorites if your a favorite you'll be fine."
bad,They have their property first over employee safety I found that with my van incident. Their default statement over all employees. They had payouts structured for promotions as a tech changed from 2019 to 2020 they made it difficult to achieve.
bad,Felt more like a number instead of an actual employee.Training was all over the place. I have done this position for years and relocated and they took my level and pay down.
bad,This was one of the worst companies I worked for. The stress from the managaement and customers was at times unbearable. The did pay well but the stress was not worth the pay
bad,"8 Hour days with flexible schedules."
bad,"Constantly playing around with your commission structure to benefit the company's  pockets, little to no collaboration with other departments (techs, sales, CS, marketing) to deliver a seemless experience to the customer, sales people not only have to compete with external competition but internal - online, inbound sales, outbound sales, contractor door to door in the same turf,"
bad,"Working for COMCAST seems like a dream job. Although there are great benefits, pay and incredible opportunity. The job is very stressful, fast paced and a bit overworked almost every single day. Great opportunity with an even greater challenge!"
bad,To many young people keeping up too much drama within the call center. They like they’re headed to a club.  This company push for sales so sometimes the Rep add things to people’s account to make their monthly quota.
bad,"The thing that really bothered me about working here is that they preach all the time about customer service, but then never deliver a satisfactory customer service to the actual customer"
bad,I worked at Comcast for 15 years and was laid off 3 times. The company doesn't care about its people--only about the bottom line. They will cut entire departments and send the jobs to Mexico and India. There is absolutely NO job security at Comcast. Work here at your own risk.
bad,"They will over work you, ""discuss your interests"" with no intention of bringing you on. I was lead to believe if I continued to keep up with my work loads and ""exceed"" expectations I would be given a chance for full time placement."
bad,"Depending on what department you go for its too much work for average pay. The department I am referring to is Dispatch (CommOps) was a horrible experience, dispatchers are not appreciated for the hard work they do, on top of taking everything else on and supervisors/ management adding more onto their plates. It was hardly  enough pay, supervisors had favorites, and again just did not feel appreciated working as a dispatcher for Comcast, would not ever recommend that department to anyone. Other departments from what I have heard are way better to work for."
bad,Alright place to work. Good benefits. There is a lot of problems that do not get resolved and the employees are the ones that end up paying for the lack of leadership.
bad,"Comcast is fun sometimes and the work environment feels like a big family. However, salary is very low compared to it's rival cable company. Lots of micromanagement and quotas can be difficult to meet. Additionally, training only teaches telephone skills but not the computer skills necessary to put packages together. There isn't enough help once you are on floor after attending ""comcast university."" Program used is very confusing and even managers would get stuck. High stress with not enough pay."
bad,"Extremely good benefits. Very good salary range. Even stock option. Very poor work environment. It’s all a bunch of favoritism. Many managers get away with murder. People that just don’t care and don’t want to work. "
bad,"Great product but extremely poor customer service."
bad,"The benefits of the company are great. The continuous change and lack of supervisor help is frustrating. No matter how informed you keep your leadership, any concerns from theri leaders, they tend to forget all the information you provided. Comcast is more focused on company advancement for shareholders, than the mental stability and low stress levels of their employees. Everything is a numbers game with no room for explanation. All answers and suggestions provided of you are that of what a CEO of the company would want and not of what logically can be achieved."
bad,"I loved the employees at comcast."
bad,start at 4:00 am go to shop and get work orders for the day your firs job might 2 miles down the road or 80 miles down the road the next job might be 80 miles back in the direction that you just came from / some people are happy to see you and some people are not you get threatened to be shot stabed killed by some people the time fram between jobs was not doable every job was differnt you might crawl through mud and water at one job and have to go into a multy million dollar home or establishment the next it did not mater what the weather was you worked every day even weekends
bad,comcast is a company that has lots of benefits for employee but as far a stats are too strict and based off of customer and you have no control over the way a customer feels about a company
bad,this is a fun work place but the pay isn't that well and is hard to move up in company. training is ok but you will learn a lot more by being out on the road. will be in heat and cold for long periods of time.
bad,"When you just want a change of scenery, or are moving to a new location and need something quick, a contract job can be a blessing. You're not committed to staying any longer than you want or need to, the contract can and often is short-term - from 6 months to a year - so you get some experience and keep your skills in use. Comcast uses a lot of the latest technologies for their internal business and client-side services, so you're likely to learn something new, even if there are only a handful of other companies using the same tech. The workplace culture is much like what you'd find at a vacation resort - everyone knows nobody is staying except the actual staff, so nobody has a tendency to really get to know anyone else, except the people you actually work with on your team on a daily basis, and even then it's minimal contact. Worst part of the job? The commute. Best part? Working from home. Management is pretty good, but since they also have to answer to someone, their hands are tied when it comes to full-time hires. But hey, it pays the bills while you look for something else."
bad,Very high demand on sales. Lots of pressure to perform and sell triple play packages and or alarms. Management is constantly being replaced. Poor training .
bad,The company has changed hands seems to still be finding its way however the camaraderie encouraged is huge. Teamwork is a big factor and is encouraged to increase product knowledge and job success.
bad,"Populated by good people who come to work every day to make a difference. Management indifference permeates region, division and corporate cultures. Focus on ""polish"" subverts independence and saps all fun out of work environments."
bad,I hope no one ever applies for this firm... they do not know how to treat employees.. horrible pay... DO NOT APPLY...  not worth the stress at all....
bad,over all work ethics were at there best being able to efficiently assist customers and get to the bottom of there needs is a plus meeting different people is also a plus as enjoy different personalities
bad,"no comment  can't say much worked for the company over many years and have seen a big shift from employee focus to monetary focus, does not help with employee attitude"
bad,The commission structure gets changed unexpectedly  and that leads to uncertainty. The job is hard and the commission given is less than satisfying. There's no financial security to plan and that's unrewarding.
bad,I enjoyed the job very fun place to work and management seemed to care and have a helping hand and positive attitude. the hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult customers
bad,"The commission you make with sales, pretty much gets taken with your taxes, it's not a job for you if you like consistency, managers/ supervisors micro manage. policies are enforced sometime"
bad,"Comcast was an ok company to work for. The best thing they did for the employees was the bonuses. As a company they gave out quarterly bonuses. When the techs did good out in the field, they got rewarded."
bad,"Not a very pleasant work experience. Although very familiar with sales was not an atmosphere I enjoyed. Staff was friendly and helped when possible, but we were always given contradicting information, and though well staffed not very difficult to find management help when needed"
bad,I was hired with one title/direction in mind but after a couple of months was led into a totally different direction.  I was hired as a Project Coordinator and ended up organizing an equipment warehouse.
bad,"this job is very inconsistent and has a big over turn in co workers, the training is really good though but the managers no nothing about any of the things we learn"
bad,"Comcast provides its employees the ability to really stretch their legs with gaining new experiences in skill sets and the latest technology. However management there is hampered in keeping employees in the company due to poor HR practices that force lower compensation and low raises. Go for the experience and take that on to your next position in your career. Plus there is free cable if your full time. I would warn against being a contractor there though, you WILL be considered a second class citizen."
bad,"Working the 3pm - 12am shift was very hectic"
bad,"Opportunity to impact millions of customers in a large way, but toxic culture impedes any actual progress.  Despite the great ideals and intentions of a lot of smart people, empire building and lack of boldness hampers any real change."
bad,"Typical day at work, arrive at customers home and the notes that you have for this customer is completely wrong, PLUS, this customer has been having issues with his/her services and had to take the day off of work to be home when we arrive."
bad,"The benefits of working for Comcast are great.  However, the potential for moving from part time to full time status isn't easily obtained.  They made it sound like it happens all the time.  I saw more people get hired with no ability to perform the job ethically, and people get fired because ""they just weren't doing enough.""  It was apparent that if you made sales then you were ok...no matter what...but if you had customer service in mind, and were just under quota, then you were replaced.  There is no training for moving up...you either were promoted unfairly, or you were fired.  Politicing is a must if you want to thrive there."
bad,"High pay with low requirements.Constant pressur to hit your numbers. If you can handle this month after month you might do well. If you have high standards and high morals and care about your customers you may find Comcast a difficult place to work. Corporate greed is what drives this company ... always demanding more from employees while paying you less at the end of the day."
bad,There is a lot of money to be made at Comcast when it comes to commission. I like that the environment is multicultural and there is lots of room for advancement.
bad,Not a great plce to grow your career. Company doesn't hire within the company. They go out and hire independent contractors... Soooo not a good look.....
bad,"After 20-30 emails,Conference call at 9am,,4pm for staff of 14 at multiple sites. Following up on pending sales,customer issues, and employee issues. Ordering promo items,reviewing sales forecast, and then field visits with reps and big box managemenet(usually 3 a day).Mangement runs over staff, new director came in and demanded reps being to be written up on performance during the middle of the sales cycle.The outcome was employees didn't trust management and morale plummeted. One rep was 95% to goal,not budget and was written up,other similar,sales standard was 50% to goal is a write up.staff Director was new to Comcast and just did what they wanted to do,regardless of what policies were in place.There is a lot of dysfunction between departments and campaigns,policis that are implemented. Many times, campaigns are rolled out without being vetted which causes major issues in customer service, billing, and sales integrity. There are a few,good  employees that are trying to make it to retirement. Worse part of job was dealing with all of the bad customer service issues, sales integrity,department's dysfunctional communication, and executive management can be vindictive with Comcast Creedo which is supposed to be anonymous way for employees to evaluate their Comcast experience."
bad,A great company to work for.   Great customer service skills.   they value their customers.   Great benefits and room to grow.
bad,"Never had the time to truly meet the customers need every time. I learned customer service, telecommunications, networking, and IT. Supervisors were great but upper management didn't take the input of its technicians to make the company more effective at solving issues while being efficient. the hardest part of the job is working on an intermittent problem and not being able to solve it at that time."
bad,"Answer the phones, makes sales, help the customer with they services problems "
bad,"I would do low trouble shoot of cust services ( checking plugs, if billing was right, if on right channel, if was turned on). some of the management cared about employees, some did not, over all tried to add fun to our days. my co-works were all great, and we all helped each other with any issues that came up."
bad,"telemarketing current Comcast customers, offering new deals"
bad,working for Comcast was a great learning experience and to break in to a newly created department and position and provide assistance to account executives.
bad,"Constant Change, Communication Between Management and Agents is very minimal. Not a lot of room for advancement."
bad,Good place to work- consistant work not much room for advancement
bad,The best part of my job is the career development of my employees.
bad,"They were always behind the 8 ball in all aspects. They are slower than government to make a decision or even come up with a competitive promo. It was so frustrating working for them. It was amazing that they raised the quota 11 months after I started and I specifically asked in the interview if quota ever changed; of course pay stayed the same. On a positive note they don't want to fire anyone, even under performers."
bad,"If your not a yes man managers don't pay you no attention, they treat you like nobody if your not making numbers,  they don't know the system and unwilling to help you."
bad,This is not the best company to work for if your looking for a flexible schedule. They make you count your calls and a lot of calls are not sales call their customer service calls and it effects your score card which is really high stress if your new you have to work Saturday and Sunday for a year.
bad,When I worked here alot of the employers was rude. On top of that people would call and cuss you out. So I personally couldnt handle this job. Itb stressed me out too much.
bad,"I was a door to door salesman and this job taught me that you have to do things you don't want to do in order to do what you want to do. I don't regret this job but I don't recommend it for everyone either. When it's hot, IT'S HOT! When it's cold, IT'S COLD. Be prepared to cooperate with all types of people and situations that happen on the fly."
bad,Increase culture as well as following the company code of conduct if Comcast has future plans of growth within. The sales are easy to make on the frontline back end operations with corporate need major work.
bad,"Perverts can call and say anything they want and your just supposed to brush it off without delevoping ptsd. Good pay, very high stress ,ridiculous metrics. It was fun while it lasted but there was no stability, watching people that have been there for 10 years and get fired over numbers seems wasteful and customers are crazy and can say whatever they want on the phone and your not aloud to hang up. When I say getting fired by numbers I mean metrics not you didn’t hit your target revenue. Someone calls and hangs up or wrong department hurts your metrics and it happens all the time . I was there for nearly 3 years and it got worse and worse over time. "
bad,"Too many changes, while working for this company I have experienced changes that most people would experience over a 5-10 year period. Changes were not announced appropriately nor in a timely manner. Expectations are too high, for such a low base salary."
bad,Depends on what department you work for. Bulk department is very stressful and the Numbers you have to make is very hard to do. I love the company Comcast but I don’t like the bulk department with Comcast. Customer’s can talk to you any kind of way. Supervisor’s don’t want to take calls and they make you feel bad if you have a sup call.  You get penalize if you have to send a tech out to install a upgraded service to a customer home and you don’t get your tar. .
bad,"$15 for a cable technician is garbage, too much stress. Even tho they give you the right tools to do the job, the Company is too big for it self, they do care about employees but they can’t manage it right to help you out on a daily  basis. You will be held responsible for every job, like it should be, but some stuff it’s out of your control and still will damage your metrics at the end of the month. The best part of working at Comcast was the team work and the support I had coming from my supervisor."
bad,Comcast is not a good place to work if you are working on the phone in customer service and repair department they highly favortize there employee's and single ppl out
bad,"I had someone that wasn't even a customer call in on me, and they lied saying that I said some things that I never said. Comcast then decided to place me on administrative leave with pay for 3 weeks. Then they turned around and fired me with no proof of anything, just straight let me go. They will overwork you a have you out all night finishing assignments and don't think twice about it. The work is a physical demanding job and they really don't care just as long as you get the job done, they could careless about anything."
bad,"Comcast pays decent due to commission and quartly bonus .They don’t around your schedules . Horrible schedules .. They allow the custome to talk to you any way . New policy abs company produces you not inform about . Comcast don’t care about the customer , complaining about rates told wrong information and etc . But as agent you always have to listen to customer vent , explain to them it Comcast policy ."
bad,"Employees are not valued; Only sales. It is a super high pressure sales position. Deliver or your fired. Your put into a retention role, and told it is sales. Being honorable hurts your paychecks, and sleazing aids it. Every transaction you are given a choice. Screw the customer, screw the company, or screw yourself. Have no illusions this job is killing your soul for money. I pity those still stuck there."
bad,"Company goals are tailored to profit the company, not to compensate the employees. Selling more doesn't mean more money, and it can change with very little warning."
bad,"Don’t do it. Worked at an outsourced contact center for nine months and was miserable - bad leadership, insufficient training, sets customers and associates up to both have a bad experience."
bad,"Work in all weather. Safety issues "
bad,The company tries to give incentives to make up for how stressful the job is but ultimately the base pay isn't sufficient especially for new hires commission is getting lower and sometimes with the first call resolution gate people don't even get it.
bad,This is actually a great job with some good benefits. The work and life balance is great due to the part time hours. The only misleading part is the progression. The job is great as is. I would call this a transitional job rather than trying to support a household or family. Great benefits. Plus really cheap cable!
bad,"This sales job started off great until the company decided to terminate certain to save money, which obviously led to people being laid off. I wasn't too happy about that move on their part."
bad,fast pace learn how to sale tv services management was ok but culture was to sale movies and all tv programs all the time.  Hardest part was to sell tv service or movies because your commission was only 2% or something close to that. I really did not enjoy that job.
bad,"very repetitive days, nothing really changes other than the tools you use, treated VERY poorly, Very little sick time and encouraged to never use it. Extremely strick."
bad,On call was not fun. It is a corporate company and if you are a contractor you are treated as such. Good stepping stone however and I have no regrets coming or going.
bad,The typical work day includes receiving assignments for customer complaints and working with multiple departments within the company to resolve reported concerns.
bad,"When I reached the Corporate office, I saw how people behaved and then understood how things ""rolled downhill"".  Having a leader in the learning organization unable to provide specific, factual feedback on performance (when that's what the learning organization is supposed to be all about) was not only disappointing, it was the final piece that told me it was time to look for a different place to work. People were more interested in looking good than serving the population of agents and technicians and that was also disappointing."
bad,I worked for the company for years and with every year that passes they lose the human touch towards their employees. At this point we all feel like robots. They tack on more to your work load with every change and the rate of pay doesn't change. The benefits used to out weigh the stressful nature of this job but it's not worth it anymore.
bad,"Exactly what my Summary says. It feels like working in a high school because of all the drama people bring in to the work place. The policies are not kept through out the company, they are bent to accommodate certain individuals."
bad,Favoritism is obvious and job skills are overlooked when attempting to move up within the company.  Lack of support from leadership and constant change within the HR department causes much confusion when assistance is needed.
bad,Xfinity is okay. Not the greatest I experienced with most compensation jobs. Service is great and system is a little out to date like most places. overall decent job.
bad,Comcast is an incredibly large company that is very results oriented and does not care much about employees or their quality of life. It is a tough company to stay at for a long time.
bad,"it paid well but they did not care about keeping employees, if they weree all about taking care of the customer as they clam, they would have put more effot into keeping the people they have."
bad,"The company constantly says they want feedback on issues that we can identify and see repeatedly. This information is CONSTANTLY given to immediate supervisors, management and from there who knows where it goes. Then when enough customers call in about service issues the company states that they have identified an issue and need feedback from techs in the field. While this feedback is constantly given, verbally and electronically, the company continues to ask for feedback as though none has ever been given. Upper management went as far as hiring a third party company to setup a conference call line for each team so that weekly we could all talk about issues we were seeing, methods we used to fix the issues if we had any, and concerns we had about new products rolling out, new procedures that would be coming into effect, yet it always fell on deaf ears and we were yet again asked for feedback and examples. The pay was under market average for the work that we did. We had brought this up for years and every time upper management came to put out the fires of unrest, they justified the low wages with ""Well we give you so many benefits,"" that included discounted, not free, service with the company, health benefits, and discounts at companies most employees never shopped at. Promotions and raises were hard to achieve as the metric system that weighted how well you worked throughout the year were skewed against you. Customer caused issues were counted against you. Company software failing counted against you. Customers calling in with questions after you left the job counted against"
bad,"Management actually stood in front of a sale meeting and said that ""if you're not lying you're not trying."""
bad,"Comcast wants their employees to lie to their customers to meet metrics. Employees must tolerate disrespectful, irate customers. They pressure you into sales and if you don’t meet a certain amount they will fire you. I feel like I could lose my job any day. Turnover rate is horrible and I will be in the process of looking for another job."
bad,"Pay was great, benefits were great, yeah you get bagels on Fridays, but you also get reemed out all day by angry customers, no time to recover between calls, thrown right back into the mix. SALES SALES SALES no matter how much they tell you it isn't about that!"
bad,"Worked at the Call Center. Long hours with customers cussing you out over the phone. Very stressful. Managers were rarely helpful, but my team was cool."
bad,Comcast is a good paying company with great benefits however it is not family oriented at all! Holidays and different schedules were always a problem.
bad,Management makes it almost impossible to move ahead in the company and it makes it very frustrating for long time representatives like myself and others with tenure.
bad,It was a great working environment. We had exciting contest for sporting events and outings. The management was hands on available to listen. You people new to working sometimes made work very interesting.
bad,I work from home - it is online Virtual. Training needs to be better as they have a lot of information and services available.  No benefits or security.
bad,"You get graded for opposite of what you do, you can work real hard and the slightest hiccup your grading gets hit and it affects progression and pay, Supervisor is unfair and overworks you the moment he gets"
bad,Avoid at all costs. Comcast looks after Comcast.  Employees are not valued and your personal brand will be attacked by everyone who finds out you work there.
bad,"Comcast has excellent benefits "
bad,"High stress, high turnover. Good Commission potential. Great training skills. Poor workplace culture. Most enjoyable part was the paycheck, the least enjoyable part was taking 40 calls per day of unhappy customers verbally accosting you."
bad,"Your job consisted of fielding inbound billing inquiries of Comcast customers. This was a difficult job primarily because the bills were confusing, the prices were always rising, and with good reason, the customers were always angry."
bad,I believe the position is a great stepping stone to other positions. I believe it is a great part time job for a college student or elderly person.
bad,During this job I was a workforce management analyst.  This job was not challenging.  I did not feel personally  or professionally fulfilled.
bad,"You have to be a strong person to work for Comcast"
bad,Working From home is great but yet consistent issues with tools and metrics that is hard to meet due to various issues with the job can lead to frustration. Plus adding in that your schedule always changes does not help either. No raises and quick turn over rate. Benefits are great and start from the day you get hired. 2 week pay period to which can either be deposited or a check mailed out. I provided online tech support for customers. Another drawback is that at times we have to work with overseas Tech support so there is a language barrier and this could lead to more customer frustration for us as techs to deal with.
bad,"Business enterprise providing contract labor to the telecommunications industry and providing services to industry leading equipment manufacturers, operating telecommunications and utility companies."
bad,Would never work there again even if they pay me one million dollars per day. I donr like placed where you are watched even if the go to the bathroom and stay over 10 minutes.
bad,"Outside sales doesn't have time for ping pong.  We prospect all day and generate revenue.  "
bad,"No diversity. Not well organized in general. "
bad,This was a contract position with a permanent position waiting but they decided not to hire any more paralegals at the end of my term.
bad,"•"
bad,Poor leadership and management skills overall. Good environment working in the retail store of Walmart. Flexible hours.
bad,Attitude was very geared towards selling with customer service coming a distant second and employee retention an even more distant third.
bad,This company treats both employees and customers as if they expendable. Low pay for the work performed. Great benefits and free cable.
bad,stressful environment but could be fun also. We were competitive in a fun way. I had great co workers and loved being on the winning teams. It was a little too far from where i lived but other then that i liked it and i gained a lot of experience in the customer service/sales filed.
bad,Comcast was a good place to work. The fact the we were able to bid on our shifts was a plus Also Comcast did serve lunch to employees which I felt was good.
bad,"overworked"
bad,The need to meet sales goals per week was insane. The call center had co workers all about starting drama. The supervisors will write you up if you are not meeting sales goals. Customers mad at comcast all of the time. Training was crazy. Don't miss this job at all
bad,THis company is very nice and treats employees with a little respect. Very organized company. Management really nice. Pay decent (could be more for the hours worked)
bad,No time for breaks on the phone. Constant high volume of calls. Management is great though! I learned to have a lot of patience in this job.
bad,"Working at Comcast was easy until they created a new department, Priority Service. The atmosphere is very different from between the two technical departments. Overall the calls were the same. Helping customers with their cable, internet, phone or billing issues. The hardest part was trying to conform to the new rules and it sort of mad the job more difficult than it was in the older technical department. However, I did enjoy the atmosphere. My coworkers were a delight to work with and we had fun in between calls."
bad,"Very good learning and life experience"
bad,"Assisted customers with billing and technical questions for cable, internet, and phone services."
bad,"When I started at Comcast everything was great after working there for a year or so things just started going down hill .. the company started pushing sale, sale, sale like crazy a.it wasn't about helping the customer anymore it was about what could i sale them how much you could sale them and if you didn't make a sale attempt on every single call that was to there liking then you would be coached on it and if they fill your not doing enough after that you would get wrote up. There were sales competitions every single week all most every day to see what team or individual could get the most sales that day. For me it just started to become to much. The management was great my Supervisors were great but the business model was un bearable..and your shift change every year."
bad,Not enough Supervisors. Ask more than what is required for Supervisors per job description. Managers not helpful who dump their workload on the Supervisors that are overloaded with their own job task.
bad,Cant truly speak on the company as a whole but rather my immediate department. My time with Comcast has been a great learning experience
bad,"I have worked at Comcast for a very long time and while I have enjoyed my time there immensely and learned a great deal, I feel that the company is moving in a direction of which I find it hard to be a part."
bad,"Expected to go to Customer's home to install Cable, Internet, or Phone service."
bad,"recieve high volumes of inbound calls - multi tasking between call volumes, customers, management and training - enjoyed working with a team of coworkers who are focused and results driven - "
bad,"Diagnostic programs where insufficient to properly do ones job, but this was when Comcast first rolled out the internet division. I’m sure things have changed since then."
bad,"An alright company"
bad,"Meet so many great people, however, when the company was transitioning to new products, the company was very limited on promotions and raises."
bad,I really liked my job and loved the people I worked with. I would have stayed if the job paid more.
bad,"Underpaid for all the work you had to do, comcast doesn't  care about their employees, no accommodating schedules."
bad,"Comcast was a micromanaging haven, regardless of your title."
bad,"It's a decent income, but a high stress atmosphere on the phone with unhappy customers."
bad,Management was very distant and never gave any guidance verbal or otherwise. all my real knowledge came from co-workers.
bad,"fast paced, learned how to micro manage better, the hardest part of the job is completing a concern of the customer when the phone system goes down. the most enjoyable part of the job is building rapport with the customer and getting the customer concerns resolved."
bad,coworkers are great but management team seem to not really care too much about the well being and needs of the employees.
bad,"almost three years in and they closed our department, with no notice (okay, they gave us a 10-min speech and said to clear out our desks). good benes like free cable/internet/phone, but the WORST pay. i had to work OT just to meet living expenses. poor management, rules changed almost daily, poor supervision by team supervisors (3 out 4 not even liked), unprofessional co-workers. they were more concerned with time on the phone rather than resolving an issue that might take up some of that precious time. did not feel supported much of the time - manager always blamed folks up the ladder over him - because they did tie our hands on too many issues. high turnover in most departments in our building due to low pay and not being treated well. if you like working long hours for low pay, this is your company. they do not share the wealth with the downline."
bad,"Office and field work, primary residential, with some B2B."
bad,"Repairing or installing equipment in residential or commercial settings. Installing cable outlets repairing tv, phone, and internet problems"
bad,fast paced customer interaction solving problems and persuading customers to upgrade products and services
bad,very high call volume great benefits but management sucks supervisor never want to assist customer with anything
bad,It's a job.I went from being a customer serv. to being a lead in a couple of months.
bad,"It was an ok place to work, I loved my supervisor and my co-workers, it was the customers that were not very nice, thus the reason I left."
bad,If you are a singl mother then this job is not for u...Comcast is not a flexible job especially if you have small kids or if you go to school.
bad,"I've never worked at a job that wasn't the least bit concerned about their customers. I honestly felt ethically compromised fulfilling my daily job duties of ""tricking"" into signing up for promotions that would expire soon and were ridiculously overpriced."
bad,stressful company to work for with little or no room for improvement
bad,They treat you great at first but then you just become another sheep to herd to them... They are way to sensitive on matter such as putting movie quotes up and then getting mad at someone for putting a pineapple express quote... get over yourself comcast!!
bad,"A typical work day at Comcast, I would start at 10:00. I would log into the operating system, and log on to take phone calls. I would stay within the system until lunch. I would then have a 30 min lunch break, and then completed the rest of my work day with two 15 minute breaks. I learned how to deal with different kinds of individuals of many different backgrounds, and beliefs. I was in contact with several different individuals on my phone calls. Management was very unorganized because he was not able to adapt to the consistently changing work environment. My co-workers were very friendly, and willing to help each other through difficult calls. There wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with many different types of people."
bad,"worker bee mentality, good pay for commission. retention of customers, learned to talk to customers."
bad,Interviewed for several positions and were either cancelled or waited to contact me after I already had another job
bad,really hard to move up. your pay is based on what the customers think of you. co-workers are great thats about it
bad,The managment was very poor and unknowledgable. This also carried over into the training which was provided by the company which was minimal at best.
bad,Too many layers of management. The last plantation... Management more focus on sales numbers and no interest in developing personnel for future career opportunities.
bad,This was the toughest job that I have ever worked. It had so many obstacles with not enough resources to get over them.
bad,"Where will Comcast be in 5-10 years? Who knows, but I think their biggest threat is regulation. Yes, they own the last mile, so barriers to entry are huge (just ask Verizon and AT&T), and more and more consumers are going over the top. But if the federal government decided that their power over consumers and content providers was ""unfair"", then could quickly become just a dumb pipe to your house."
bad,The most difficult customers I've encountered and unsupportive bureaucracy for management
bad,Everything is against the clock. Under the pressure to get things done. Everything tends to be time sensitive.
bad,Very stressful the company isn't all it say it is co workers were okay managemnt was horrible.
bad,"The benefits are really awesome. However, the work life balance is not a consideration of upper management."
bad,I know from working there are many people weren't satisfied with the metrics etc. There are too many decent ratings for this location when in fact people are disgruntled. It almost seems Comcast has a twist with Indeed ratings. Seriously mine is missing from here. What is going on Indeed?
bad,Too much stress to get a decent check Work mainly on commission there were a lot of guidelines but a lot of loopholes there was a lot of favoritism. I
bad,"Good benefits for entry level, tell you you have advancement options but don’t help getting to them. Feedback is poor and communication lacks severally."
bad,"The structure of Comcast needs to be improved as far as the company's mission. The mission is to improve the customer experience, but they forget at times that the employee is also their customer. The employee experience needs great improvement when it comes to issues like flexibility and fairness. Not all employees are treated the same."
bad,"great benefits, great pay. The agents are good people. I like the Comcast cares day that is yearly. its great to give back in your own community. Stressful work environment"
bad,"If you can handle difficult people you would be good for this company.  Customer's call in with billing, technical or any cable related questions.  Some times you need to be patient and calm."
bad,This was my first job out of college. I did not receive the training or the proper management that to succeed. The office I worked in was full of older and complacent individuals.
bad,"Management did not seem to care that their subcontracted employees would often lose sales by refusing the job, or talking customers out of the sold services."
bad,"Great pay, discounts are great but don't have time nor energy to enjoy it. Most customers are the worse and floor support barely want to take escalated calls. If you don't mind being cursed at or threaten then this is the job for you."
bad,This position is not for long term purposes. Management is poor and unprofessional. You have your good days and your bad days. The only good days are those that come with food.
bad,"A typical day at Comcast was exciting. I learned a tremendous amount about video, high speed internet and phone services. the hardest thing about this position was being chased by dogs. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. I can't say enough about their benefit package it was the best I had seen in years."
bad,"The job is extremely stressful, the employees and supervisors are amazing people. The benefits are terrific, I really don't have anything else I can say about this job."
bad,comcast was a good company to work for they pay you for there training and there benefits and 401k are great too. My only complaint is the pay was lower than i think it should have been.
bad,"I've been working for Comcast about a year and half now and I must say the work/life balance is pretty good, the benefits are great. The upper management and dispatch is where the problem lies."
bad,"Great part time , late hours , co worker are amazing! one of my favorite jobs , lots of perks, not  much room for growth , better for like a college or high school part time job"
bad,"I was there 13 years and it was great but when Wall street took over things changed and employees really didn't matter.  "
bad,"Great job, great benefits. Was terminated while on workers comp due to an accident cause by another driver. Other than that, it's was a great place to work."
bad,"Horrible customer service, the supervisors does a terrible job and the management team is non helpful"
bad,"Large company that strives for greatness, doesn't always provide the best customer service to clients."
bad,"processes are vaguely described but harshly penalized."
bad,It was ok I didn't like it very much. found a better place to work
bad,This is a Call center environment where subscribers would call-in anticipating a resolution to billing or technical issues.
bad,"You start your day off there with the supervisor and other employees in a huddle and pounded with making sales and meeting the quoter every morning, I learned to verify when you apply for a customer service position to make sure sales are not included. Management is very poor there never wanted to take any complaint calls. The co-workers were good people to work with.The hardest part of the job is having to make a sale to someone that is not happy with there service. It was not enjoyable moments there."
bad,"When I start working for this company, I enjoyed going to work. The job is centered around customer service, addressing billing inquires, payments, and sales. During the time I worked for this company I enjoyed working with my coworkers, because we work so well as a team."
bad,"All they cared about was sales, in a customer service position."
bad,Comast Corporate is out of touch with their customers and employees.  Majority of the corporate decisions do not have the customer or the employee experience in mind.  Most ideas get implemented without proper consult then are kicked back upstairs for further review and scrutiny.
bad,The environment was very positive. I felt welcomed by everyone in the building. The pay is great and they give good opportunities to younger people with little experience.
bad,Although this job provides for my family which I'll always be grateful for. I have lost most of my faith in our companies morals. I believed in the the beginning that this would be the place where I would want to retire. However. I war he'd this company let go of an amazing worker to protect an employee who is poisonous to the culture.
bad,"Great benefits bad leadership for the company. Favoritism. Change is fine but there was never any real training on the changes until"
bad,This would have been the perfect job if upper management would have listen to complaints about local managers who were unprofessional and played favoritism toward other employees.
bad,"was an ok place to work as a team, but it was stressful and at times, with no consistency in pay. worked there for 4 years and the pay was increasingly being affected yearly and had to work harder for the same or less money"
bad,"would, not recommend any friend or contact to work here. Customers are too hostile at times. No time between calls to reflect. Not a lot of help at times."
bad,I am currently employed at comcast as a repair agent I absolutely love the work environment the pay is great benefits are great but it's only because there is no job security until you meet the metrics perfectly 3 months in a row at first they wanted the metric to average out now it has to be perfect all the way around  which is hard to do they make you sign a paper basically letting you know if you don't advance to the next level within your year of being there your fired. If you are currently at a job where you have job security please stay there.
bad,"Allways a timeline to complete an assignment. constant communication problems between customers and customer service. As a technician, you have way too many obstacles to"
bad,"A culture in flux, good place to learn your craft-however, your colleagues are not necessary in the same mode as you. People tend to be either extremely good at their jobs or not. Tough to raise issues to leadership to effect change."
bad,"Handle incoming calls from prospective customers or clients"
bad,poor mangement i hate it there it was all about favortism not equal oppurtunity i got sent home for wear navy bkue casual shoes my 4th day of work poor
bad,"A typical day at comcast as a field tech would consist of being at work early. Make sure your van had the proper equipment to do your daily jobs. Do any small task at the shop either for your van, or for your personal self. There is free coffee so, i took advantage of that. "
bad,very stressful very busy under paid for the amount of work and stress overall it was ok early on I recommend it for a person in entry level just getting into the work field.
bad,Our department was overhauled in fall 2013. New Upper Mgt was not hired until January 2014 with half of them let go by the Spring. It was difficult to have success as their was minimal support in place for most of 1+ years. Met a number of good people on our team with a great work ethic.
bad,"The issue with this job was people being put in leadership positions that shouldn't have been, they were placed there because of people they knew and they had no idea about the job itself. They were not remotely qualified yet continue to be moved up in the company."
bad,I liked working for Comcast and was sad when they outsourced overseas and I lost my job.
bad,log in answer phones
bad,great environment in working outside and with costumers. enjoyable
bad,it was very interesting working in the call center. and helping customers save money
bad,Everyone's experience is different. Mine so happened to be fair. Also its what you make of it and if you get along with the boss or not. I don't have anything else to say
bad,A typical day at work would consist of me working my butt off for bs wages. The hardest part of the job is working in cold weather and carrying a big ladder.
bad,It's a good company with great benefits and opportunity for advancement. However management isn't the greatest and not all employees are treated fairly.
bad,Constant evolving environment.  Commission is fair for entry level position.  growth into management is obtainable. learning opportunities always available
bad,"Typical day is stressful, customer order never is what you expect always extra work. "
bad,Company was not a bad company to work for. Great benefits and great people to work with.Great management. Not to many job advancement opportunities...
bad,It was ok the hours always changed nothing was permanent u never knew if you knew the people you worked with on that day. They make a lot of false promises in training. But the employees are amazing. The personality in comcast is great. Beware of retaliation though.
bad,"While it was an interesting and semi lucrative position, it pulled me away from the family once too many times and there were always discrepensies in the pay"
bad,"I worked for this company for over 21 years and provided consistent dedication, customer service, professionalism, flexibility and Teamwork in order of assisting Comcast in being the leader of its industry. It is very shameful to say that they have no dedication or commitment to their employees and terminate employees  positions while other positions are open in the same department."
bad,I Got Hired Downtown And I Was Only There For 2 Weeks For The Training They End Up Firing Me And Lied And Told The Secuirty Company  I Was Working For That I Had On A Bunch Of Make Up Which Isn’t True I Mean Overall Training Was Okay But They Are To Stuck Up
bad,"Like any large corporation, you are treated as a demographic as opposed to an individual. Everything is standardized. Pay and benefits are good, but if you don't move up or if you really like the job and do not wish to change, your salary gets capped."
bad,I worked in Michigan it was fine the thing is shift changes and they try and fire you constantly! They change the stats and make it impossible to reach them!
bad,its a pretty cool 75% stressful job. you supervisors are cool but management starting to become super strict. the customers talk to you any kind of way. but if you are a claim person its not gonna get to you
bad,"installing equipment"
bad,"The job is stressful.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  It may not be as stressful for others, it's just not for me.  I am more of a creative individual."
bad,"Great company to work for, I personally didn't enjoy the telesales department. Cold calling and getting yelled at all day didn't make me eager to go to work."
bad,The most enjoyable part of being a Comcast technician is meeting new people and helping them sole their IT and telecom needs. I've learned that know matter what customer satisfaction is top priority. Every customer  is different  so its up to the technician to be confident and competent enough to leave a good impression.
bad,"In the Beginning was great. "
bad,"Comcast was a excellent company within itself. The only thing I didn't like about the companies policy was if you didn't have atleast 25% in sales quote then u would be term. Now there wasn't a way around that, even if you had put forth an effort in making that 25 and you fell short 2 calls.. That's my only downfall about Comcast Telesales department but the other department I don't know anything about ."
bad,This job is not the job for me. I sat in the back and it felt like I was sitting in a closet with computers and other people. I was in school and they didn't make me feel like I was apart of the team.
bad,The people are great and great benefits.  There are metrics that have to be met including sales.  If you don't meet these goals you get put into an action plan and if you still don't meet them you are fired.    They say they are all for the customer but when you have to keep pushing for sales when the customer wants to lower their bill.
good,"there is no room to grow, management isn't always available none organized, it is not much to say about working in my department quota is never right."
good,"there is not going to be any changes , why bother writing a review, there longer you are here the worst you treatment will become, No one cares if you survive or not , it;s all about themselves."
good,"would of been more fun to work there if i wasnt so worried about getting fired every second of the day, and did not like being talked about the whole time i worked there. but other than that the job was fun and the work was easy, customers were fun to talk to as well,"
good,This contractor service was by far the worst experience ever. It was all about favoritism
good,Money used to be good but the company has consistently whittled down commissions and incentives. The hourly pay is not competitive and if you have any sort of bills or a family to support you definitely cannot survive on your hourly.
good,I worked at the miramar location managment is horrible job security is horrible they are not college friendly so I dont recommend a college student to work there and they pay there is not valuable for the cost of living here in miami or broward
good,Provide accurate details of Comcast’s advance billing system; elaborate on the payment posting process; customize promotions to fit the customers’ personal needs; solve extremely irate situations in an expeditious manner; abide by all call center metrics; responsible for 80-100 inbound calls per day
good,Black cities has black management teams that only think of themselves. This company has the most physiological Fmla and Short term disability  leaves than any other company in Atlanta. There should be a class action lawsuit for the stress created
good,"The teams located in the Denver Metro area are very poorly managed. I spent the better part of half of my career with this company. While working for the teams out of Philadelphia, I had very positive experiences. When I transferred to a team out of Denver, the quality of management went downhill fast. This management team, let go hundreds of talented engineers who many are now working for the competition. It is this poor future planning that shows the direction this company is heading. The quality of the product has been impacted and the customer service ""focus"" presented in the media is just that, a media campaign. The workplace culture is supposedly very open minded and supposed to place the needs of the customer first, but this is not the case."
good,The hours were no fun. If you dont have a sales mentality you probably wont do well. Pushing sales are encouraged and they count no matter what they tell you. They were pretty good regarding unforeseen illness.
good,"The pay was commission based so if you ever apply to work for comcast, do not apply to do door to door sales unless you have another form of stable income coming in. Training was once or twice a week at the office which wasn't bad but they prefer you to have your own vehicle to go to and from the office to your home or to the places where you would be going door to door(the position is not reccomended for people who take the metro)."
good,"You basically have no life you are on call two days a week and one weekend a month. There is always overtime, alot of work under staff."
good,"assisted with billing question , transfered customer to proper departments."
good,too much change not enough time to adjust a lot micro managing
good,"Customer service, inbound calls, coaching, problem solving, and maintaining customer accounts. Troubleshooting over the phone with customer. Retaining customers."
good,Unfortunately the collections department was fairly new to the organization. It lacked stable an room for advancement.
good,It's a great job for anyone looking for a position in the customer service field
good,No job security for those that have seniority.  Ad revenue and subscribers has continued to decline which continues to make their business lines less and less profitable.
good,"Some of the people were nice & then there are well you know, the work was very easy, its a very nice building, they had free coffee & on Fridays there were fresh fruit trays for everyone to enjoy."
good,I worked for Comcast almost 2 years they are a pretty decent company feel like they should pay more depending on where you live the management was awful work place was stressful constant office drama pay was decent benefits and incentives is what kept me overall not a bad company but they consolidated our location in Vermont
good,this was not an actual paid job but an internship that wasn't beneficial to my learning in my field of career. I pretty much did nothing was not really allowed to.
good,There was barely and work/life balance even though that was one of the MAIN things that was talked about in the interview. Management was unprofessional.
good,Internal job post are already designated for certain candidates which makes it hard for others to grow. Employees ends up sharing responsibility with co-workers who has higher pay without getting any raise or recognition.
good,In the Project Management area we do not have a lot of advancement unless someone moves up or out.  So you might find this to not be the kind of place you would want to end your career.
good,"There is never enough time to complete every task given to you. Maintaining customers happiness, getting their situation handled, trying to sell them something, and making sure the call is under 5 minutes is unreasonable. "
good,I made good money working here but my shift was not beneficial because I had a child and I didn't get to spend much time with her due to the hours I worked. I tried on several occasions to get a shift bid and was denied to due missing days from work. I only missed days when my child was sick and that was it.
good,The job is fast paced and hard work. The pay could be better but they do offer some decent benefits. Comcast is a 24/7 operations so homelife is tough to manage.
good,"Although the rate of pay was awesome, I absolutely hated the working environment here. The management cared nothing about personal emergencies, they wanted you to be at work no matter what."
good,"•	Install, reconnect, add and/or change video products or services in compliance with National Electrical Code (NEC). Connect customers' home video entertainment equipment, including, but not limited to, ""picture-in-a-picture,"" home theater, surround sound and others. Troubleshoot and repair, and explain to customers equipment use."
good,"Good products, awful training to ALL areas. Specially Sales. They lie to get a few bucks more but then billing has to fix their mistakes."
good,didnt pay well management was terrible. no work life balance. management is all for self doesnt care about you. ok job if your fresh out of college but if you are experienced and expecting certain pay dont apply here.
good,contractor tech.make you work long hrs. cant make own schedule being contractor. they make you have to work 6 days. they make you work sundays. you pay for everything
good,"There is no comment, Comcast just wasn't for me. I felt like the management didn't care for the employee enough for me. They expect you to sale sale sale and no customer service that does't work for the customers."
good,It's big business.  Everyone seems to be a number.  Great employees get let go due to ridiculous circumstances.  It seems as though you must find a way to tippy-toe through the minefields to have longevity.
good,I had the wirst experience working there . they were never really into helping there employees.....I don't know what else I can say
good,a starter job for a sales person.  this job will definitely make you appreciate a good opportunity.  if you are looking for something part time apply for this job
good,"This was perhaps the worst place I ever worked. The culture was nothing short of a college frat house. Some of the most unprofessional people I have worked with. Management with egos they had no business having. People in power who should never have been given it in the first place."
good,"Overall Comcast is a great Company. The division i worked for was Business Services. The management in that building is horrible. No one communicates. You may be on a team with 3 supervisors but 1 direct supervisor but they all say and do things differently. Not fair. What one supervisor does for one employee, should be done for everyone."
good,"i worked selling shoes and apparel to every walk of life while maintaining a professional attitude. Not a bad summer job, however the pay was not good and the job was not rewarding."
good,I just feel that the training given was not enough to do the job well. There was an enormous amount of information that was not taught in the classroom. Very unorganized as far as that aspect of the company.
good,"I found it very difficult to support a fsamily based on if a customer either wants to buya car, or is just killing time test driving cars for the afternoon."
good,Calling clients trying to get them to switch to dish and dealing with returns.Also setting appointments for installation
good,"A typical day at work for Comcast can be very challenging and stressful, taking up to 70+ calls a day in the Billing call center, while attempting to control call, resolve billing issue, sell products, compromising and/or pushing sales. I can say I have learned a lot about the company, that I didn't know, as well as a call center, being my very 1st call center experience, also learned to use Cisco phone systems, virtual phone/tool kits, and also have learned that I do not want a career with Comcast. Managers are always present (mostly supervisors), actual call center managers are heartless and unreasonable when it comes to family/home  life, such as  emergency time off etc. there will still be penalties behind it, up to termination. if there need to be addressed, issue resolution or overall assistance. My coworkers are wonderful, I really have grown to love them all over this time period, they truly know the definition of a team. The hardest part of the job for most of us is selling/meeting sales goals/metrics, we are graded and watched closely regarding everything and any growth/perks are based on performance alone which is, also, very strict since I do not have a strong sales background, and initially applied for a role in Customer assistance alone. To add fuel to the fire, we ""Billing Agents"" are now being trained and required to sell Verizon Wireless products alone with Comcast services, with no additional pay to work as Billing Agents and (Sales Reps I suppose)hourly compensation, when we have a designated ""Sales"" department, whose not required to push Verizon Wireless."
good,"Unless you like being left to your own devices with no support and unattainable goals, i would pass on this company."
good,divided into regions
good,would never work there again. they make you work long hours regardless of compensation or regards for you personal well being. the only good part about the place is the co-workers.
good,"A typical day is laidout for you per minute. inconsistant rules and guidelines, rude customers call to lower and discuss bill. The company wants you to take verbal abuse with a smile. Its a cut throat environment that thrives on the keeping inadequate employees. i received 100 % surveys rated by customers by got fired for coming in late from a shuttle they provided. All while not paying you enough to live on."
good,I guess the job is ok if your lucky enough to get a supervisor who is fair and doesn't play favoritism. My job would maybe be better if i had a better supervisor
good,"Working at Comcast in the beginning was great I was able to make sales and a good income, however this all changed when Comcast decided to go with a more scripted call flow making it difficult to feel natural for a person who was naturally good at sales on their own."
good,I have been a long time employee and I have figured out that Comcast doesn't care about their employees well-being. if you are sick an have to leave in an ambulance you will receive a point for attendance if you didn't call.
good,The Project Manager position at Comcast was a joke. The management team worked to get rid of those they did not like and kept or worked with those they liked.
good,"No job security, shady place to work, managers don’t care about employees only numbers you have to help them. It’s what have you done for me lately. Hours are horrible"
good,"too stressful and unnecessarily so"
good,"fast paced call center."
good,"really good benefits. How ever the most stressful place you could ever work. Days with no lunch breaks, supervisors that micro manage and watch every move."
good,"if you want no emotion, to feel dead inside and are willing to turn your life upside down every couple months, this is the job for you.  and hopefully you don't need any support."
good,"Extremely Stressful, no time for lunch."
good,Many cross-functional teams assigned to do the same task. There is no ownership or accountability in the Product organization. The business would benefit from stronger leadership.
good,"A company that has a hard time with change. Does well to try and benefit employees i.e. 401k, stocks, and service discounts. Does not do well with keeping loyal employees."
good,"After your year is up you are free to apply to any other department with openings. Depending on who your supervisor is and/or Manager they will make it hard for you to advance within the company. It literally feels like you're in sinking sand and you cant save yourself. MOST Managers and supervisors aren't like that, but the ones i encountered have been. You can ever get a straight answer out of them and every movement is like its a secret. The pay is wayyyy to low for all of what is required of the employee. Although, they do offer GREAT benefits, Comcast can stand some tweaking and if not they are going to find themselves in bigger trouble than what they are already in. And also, if you're hired and you are asked on how you can change the dynamic of the company, dont answer they will take your suggestions and pass them off as their own and then fire you.."
good,"Have terrific products but bad Management Issues.  Constantly changing what procedures to follow on daily basis.  Managers and Supervisors leaving, this is a true indicator of performance."
good,The management can really kill the morale at times. Your co-workers are what makes your day worth it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount on cable.
good,"This job was very stressful and it scripted. You have to read directly from a scripted and was graded. I was unfair CAEs were graded by QA that had NEVER taken a call to understand what 99% of mistakes made by CAE. We had to basically LIE to the customer in order to retain them but wasn't allowed to roll them from one promotion to another without getting written up. Comcast HONEST did not care about the customer just the business. Customer relative called in to cancel services due to death, Comcast demanded CAE to as caller if they had services with us and if not would they like to transfer the deceased family member services. Those questions got all CAEs verbally cursed out all because we HAD to read a script just to retain customer services. This place caused a tremendous amount of health issues on me, causing me to miss many days of work due to health issues (with medical documentations ) but they didn't care nor acknowledged my health issues started there, which later ended in termination due to excessive absenteeism"
good,"I didn't receive any training at my location, my manager was promoted while I was new and I was left totally out on my own as I worked from home as a Account Executive. I was flown to Denver for ""boot camp"" it was more on selling scenarios and no training on any of the systems needed do your job."
good,"It took me two years to get this job and when I finally did , I was excited. Then I started the job. Most people don't like Xfinity and I had to deal with irate customers daily. The work I needed to put in versus the pay did not even come close to being in the same ballpark. Management is not available. However, the benefits are fantastic. I'm glad I got the experience."
good,"Just to be fair: I only speak for this division / location , it may be a different environment for other location. I find the work place culture depressed as there are serious issues keeping managers since I had 5 different managers in the last 2 years in the same department. Raises are unpredictable despite stable work quality as unfairly treatment is very common. I have tried to help this expanding division with new processes and procedures, training material and more that I had gained at my previous company. Despite all the minuses I invested 5 1/2 years and I believe now it is time to look for better opportunities. I can say though that my VP was incredibly knowledgeable, involved and fair."
good,"I was putting in 60 hour weeks steadily and they were billing techs as part time employees ontop of contractor per job compensation which ended in a class action lawsuit for unpaid overtime. I did not participate in this lawsuit but it caused this installation to go under."
good,"As long as you can drink the office kool-aide and do what you are told - regardless of company motto or personal beliefs, this is the place for you! "
good,"Had a bad manager & management above me.  "
good,"Answering the phones, trouble shooting customers experiencing difficulties with internet or phone service. Most of my co workers were helpful. Management was unorganized and I felt bad for customers because we were not trained properly."
good,Comcast is constantly changing things and not for the better. They need to stick with a procedure that works instead of the constant changing.
good,"This company has great pay, and the benefits are first class. However, the working environment is hostile."
good,Excellent company to work for. The opportunities for advancement within this company were somewhat lacking and compensation was bit low for what they were wanting.
good,"Worked in a call center environment, the company had a contract with a insurance company for Medicare Part D. The name of the insurance company was Silverscript Insurance."
good,11am to 7mp you must be at the office by 10am to check in with your supervisor and tell him or her how your day went. They tell that you have freedom with your schedule and hours not true at all you. They call you to check up on you.
good,"when I was a top sales agent, I earned several monetary incentives weekly."
good,Too many layers of management. Lack of customer support and retention.
good,Long hours with no help from management. Employes know more than the management. No advancement unless you are good friends with the management.
good,"Comcast in Colorado acts as a secondary corporate center to Philly. There recently has been some changes in Human Resources where it appears the employee no longer have many rights. Loyal senior employees are being let go at the drop of a hat, so if your looking for job security in Colorado you may wish to look elsewhere..."
good,"Fired for something someone else did. Union would not help because I wasn't a ""union supporter"". Person who did said thing got week off W/O pay. Have to support people in higher classification, but they will not help you."
good,I cannot state this enough there was no communication between the people in charge and the mangers on the floor... one thing that it seemed like was that no one knew what to do and when we needed the advise they would ask the supervisors so our roles were reversed the call center manager was a bit younger than me and had heavy accent. so for folks who are looking for good jobs this is ok if you need money and want over time college kids and such.
good,"Lack of communication from the region down to store management. A lot of newsletters or an email with little to no face to face. "
good,"Great benefits , great place to work.  Not really flexible.  The company does promote within. There is a lot or career advancement and training for employees"
good,"Work place culture has been ran into the ground due to having a horrible manager and director in place; blind leading the blind. Supervisors are too friending with those working on their team, while spreading gossip too one another and about one another; thick as thieves!"
good,Comcast is a okay place to work. The commission is so so. The management is very poor. The turn over is really high. They barely provide sales training.
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for. The problem is that there is any uniformity from supervisor to supervisor.  Nothing is done the same. And the focus of the day is only for today and not tomorrow.  One day it's repeats , the other is pht( although 1 has nothing to do with the other. The management seems not to have a clue as to what is going on on the field. And this is from someone who went from a ComTech 2 to a ComTech 4 that performs 8 different duties at someone's home."
good,"Stressful environment with ever changing metrics to measure performance.  The best qualified candidates don't always get the promotions, depends on the overall ""mood"" of the workforce."
good,Its hard to move up unless u have been there for 10 years or kiss have a good political standing with someone. Guys get promoted in 3 years who dont deserve it because there friends with management and guys who have been there 10 plus that actually deserve it but get by passed. We spend money trying to save money when are customer service is still making customers cry literally.
good,"The environment and culture are incredible, better than any place I have worked. "
good,"Comcast the company is not a bad place to work. However, its really like playing roulette when it comes to getting a decent manager. Some of the leadership in this company is completely toxic to their employees while others are ACTUAL leaders."
good,Comcast forces its left wing liberal political beliefs on its employees and if employees do not conform they are terminated. Employees are not recognized for their efforts.
good,"I worked in sales on the new Xfinity stores when they first opened. The hours were very long with regular mandatory overtime. The shifts were sometimes 10+ hours, on your feet all day. The schedules were different every week and you would often end up working 7+ days back to back with your off days on the beginning of one week and the end of the following week.  The systems were ancient and the trainers could barely teach us how to use them. The pay was minimal and the commision structure made it difficult to make any real money. I saw a lot of shady selling practices as a result. The benefits were excellent. I would work for the company again but not in that role."
good,"Day to day operations. learned a lot about the cable industry, it's best to be a part of professional and development groups to get a head and network"
good,They didn't care about the employees.. just the numbers. Too much drama and not enough clarity within the company. No excitement and never any positive feedback from supervisors.
good,"up to 85% churn in this co. After 5 Years at company over 65% of total employees are hired after me. take take and take. dont ever were any comcast shirts or hats out in public, youll get attacked"
good,I didn't feel appreciated as an employee. They make promises they can't keep. Like as far a schedules go and the pay. I would go to new cust sales and not existing sales. most of those calls end up being tech calls.
good,"Comcast management from very top to local has no clue what a technition in the field actually does..  Field roles are very heavily taken for granted, overloaded work schedule so many many no lunch days.  If your detached from the outside field work Comcast is a wonderful place to work...catered lunches...weekly back massage therapist comes in."
good,It is an ok company to work at if you like freedom and being independent. Everything else is terrible......................................................
good,"While overall I believe Comcast is an excellent place to work, Comcast Spotlight is laying a lot of people off and failing to make budget.  Be wary of accepting a role here is you are looking for long-term career stability."
good,"Working as a contractor is always stressful, however got to learn a lot of things with respect to technology, team work.  However, there is no job security, and also the payscale is pretty low."
good,"work culture and rewards are solely based on numbers. no rewards for loyalty. HR managers make it their business to get rid of injured employees even if means lying to cover their mistakes."
good,My manager would give me different assignments to in-put into the database and would get upset if I would ask questions. This was a very stressful place for me to work and I ended up becoming very sick because of the verbal abuse from the manager.
good,"Shifts are not to good they change the shifts every week which dis balance the  daily routine, It was  my first job and it was not that much good overall I learn alot here."
good,"Loved job with great starter potential. As you attempt to progress in the company is where you may see struggle. As a person not complacent needed a little more room for success,"
good,"Job has pressure from manager on a everyday job, thats why i quit, they are always lowering your commission, and now they're adding charge backs, benefits are good but the job doesn't worth it."
good,"Every opportunity, is an opportunity to learn and grow.  I appreciate all of my experiences as they have helped me to become a well-rounded candidate in the career market."
good,"this company over works its employees, and offers very little posibility to advance. meeting quota is all they care about, not the customers, not the employees, just keep making sales. very stressful, and the commison basically goes towards paying your taxes."
good,The job was easy we was doing it just the manager use to play us out our money he always came with a sob story on pay day the job was easy though I enjoyed working with the public
good,A lot of hands on experience allowed for such a large company. Great way to get to meet people in the broadcasting industry.
good,i have no issue with completing all task assigned but not when everything is changed without notice and pay is decreased
good,"A typical day at Comcast consist of unlimited phone calls assisting   customers looking to place orders, also setting up bill payments, creating SRO tickets."
good,My first full time job I learned a lot about benefits and how to work with a team. I do not regret working for cash2day. Management was biased and showed favoritism
good,Work environment was ok not much of any team work and working overnight long hours made it difficult to do any day activities without burning yourself out.
good,"helping others is a passion, however when you are not given the proper training you are not allowed to do your best. working with angry customers takes patience and skill. I would have liked to have seen more training on dealing with difficult situations rather than it penalizing my bonus or rating in the end."
good,"Customers are extremely rude, and you have to have a strong mindset and tough skin to work this job. The employees are okay, the job itself is probably the worst job I've ever had. Customers throw such a tantrum over cable/internet bills,and they want to make you feel lower than dirt. If you need a good, steady source of income and dont care what the job is, then go for this, if you have school, kids, anything that will take your time throughout the day, do not apply!"
good,"In my opinion they gave us the ability to teach and help in media."
good,Company would rather hire from outside than inside. Working at the service center isnt too bad. The job requires stressful hours and sales goals even through slow seasons.
good,"30=+ calls per day, resolution expert, close work environment, easy to approach management, hard time getting enough breaks."
good,"management not so great, good benefits and vacation time, schedules are not flexible at all, co workers very nice, metrics keep getting tighter the more you meet them"
good,"While the mangers in the call center seem to care about the employees, it seems like their hands a tied due to polices written by higher level managers. It seems that the managers in higher potions have no grasp or have forgotten on what it is like for the people on the phones deal with on a daily basis. The policies change daily some for the better some not so much. Would I recommend Comcast as a place to work, that depends on the job you are applying for."
good,"Door to Door selling Retail cable services. Outdoor working conditions, all weather conditions. Overpriced product line."
good,"•	Consistently exceed sales goals by 20%."
good,This job isn't for anyone that wants a life and make money as well. You have to put away your personal life in order to make a decent check. The training process in overrated at best. There are time where you can get lost in the shuffle at this job.
good,This is a fast paste environment and that you have to know a medical background to be able to do the job satisfactorily. It is a great job and one that you could excel at and make it work with you family life
good,Not enoguh money for the work that's expected and there really is no technical skill required
good,It was fun at the time. Very conflicting hours if you have a family.
good,Do not recommend. I learned that big corporations do not really care about its employees. I really enjoyed working by myself as a technician.
good,Departments are constantly merged and restructured. Must be willing to adapt by learning new products and transferring to other departments.
good,"Raised to keep my mouth shut if I couldn't say something nice.  ""Keeping my mouth shut"""
good,I learned different ways to make and increase sales. There were alot of calls consistently coming through keeping the call center very busy.
good,It was shift work and it can be challenging trying to balance family & work schedule.
good,"Prioritizes and dispatches service and installation requests. Reschedules and/or assigns jobs to technicians. Monitors daily progress of technicians and adjust routes to accommodate customer additions, rescheduling, and cancellations while providing support to the technicians throughout the day. Inputs data into various databases used for tracking and reporting. Records completion codes in order to provide accurate service history, when necessary. Organizes daily workload by managing the day of route, assigning and reassigning work as required. Operates PC to input and retrieve subscriber account data and makes notations as needed in the appropriate workforce management tool."
good,"Comcast/ The New Xfinity, is about themselves and not the customer. Each employee tells a customer whatever to get them off the phone if they know they will not be able to make a sale on that call."
good,"Everything initally told to me in the interview process was untrue. I was told training would be 6-8 weeks with at least 3 weeks of side by side assistance before working alone. Training was 4 weeks total before they threw us ""on the floor"". Even though you are a billing agent taking calls for customers complaining about their bill you are required to meet a sales goal. Numbers must be met or you face termination. No room for slip in attendance they work off the point system. ""C"" in comcast stands for change. the policies changed three times on attendance and metric numbers before I even hit the floor. The pay is good granted you hit sales and make commison which you only get once per month. Good benefit options for single people."
good,"The management was at times unsure of company objectives, but worked well to pass the best information. Pay is a joke for this type of work and the hours required. The benefits also do not add up in the employees favor."
good,"After 9+ years working from the bottom to management with an exemplary record, the company, namely its Retail division, lacks the infrastructure to successfully implement investments in its management force to ensure full compliance understanding. With little or no management training, my market earned Top 5 in the country for % to quota in fiscal July. "
good,"Will not work with schedule, very stressful environment.I feel the services are horrible and there is a lot of micromanagement."
good,taking inbound calls mostly from people who are upset because their services are not working correctly.
good,Free cable...great co-workers. Management needs some overhauling.
good,"VP created urgency by an X theory of management. I learned a lot about sales and leadership. The co-workers were great they were like family. The hardest part of the job was 88 hours a week with no salary, only commission."
good,"very much enjoyed working with my cable tv customer, Oregon customer are very picky and dont like change"
good,"The company is well known company and the managers that work there need more training. It wasn't organized at all, but did have some what decent pay."
good,"This has been an awesome job in the fact that you get great benefits, however this position is for someone who does not have family or other duties outside of current position."
good,Comcast was exciting place to work. The department that I was in was not a good fit for me.
good,A typical day at work is helping customers and swapping boxes. I have learned to get along with all types of personalities. Management is ok but they let a lot of things pass. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of th job would be dealing with the customers and sometimes management not having your back. The most enjoyable are my co-workers.
good,"Comcast as a whole is a great company to work for, but be weary of the departments you apply for - local and NNOC are excellent opportunities but still the potential to be laid off for outsourcing is a concern. Many National Jobs require long hours with little to no compensation. Favoritism is common in some national departments and upper management treats employees like numbers not focusing on development."
good,I worked for comcast for almot a year i was young and didnt really value this job.
good,"Not much room for advancement, No consistent flow of information to keep employees on the same page."
good,Comcast is and excellent company rich in values and customer comes first. However it is this line of thinking that can cause problems for its customer service team members.
good,"comcast is a great place to work , and has great benefits , but ofcourse theres a down side . management constantly is changing policies , they think there making changes to better the company but it ends up being a disaster .and there is no communication within departments . there is no advancement unless you know somebody, becuase even if u have great numbers you still may not get promoted , some supervisors have also used there employes for personal gain ...... also some supervisors are bullies behind closed doors if you dont participate for comcast cares day a supervisor may hold that against you . they also promise incentives like quartely promotions , good luck with that promise that they cant keep. even thru all that i loved working there , just hated policy changes every week and the abuse of power from some of the supervisors ."
good,"Probably not a bad place to work if you arent in management. If you are seeking a management position, I hope you like the kool-aid of the company. Good ole boy system!"
good,"No comment, prefer not to answer as company policies prohibit social media disclosure and divulging information considered to pertain or can relate to Comcast"
good,"If you were at a call and did everything perfectly, but a customer calls within 30 days wanting batteries for their remote, it kills your numbers and possibly raise. Same if their tv dies; the call center will send a tech out to verify, but again if you were there within the 30 day window it kills your metrics which advancement and raises are based on. It’s too much of a gamble. Bad equipment from the warehouse. Mainline issues, that happen overnight. This doesn’t even cover the work environment (going into hoarder houses, houses full of roaches/fleas/rodents/just dirty people in general [where you can smell the ammonia from urine a block away]). The company likes to pat itself on the back and say “good job!”, but doesn’t really care about the customer or the employees."
good,I was after the time to succeed in my role had passed. The Seattle market is saturated with Comcast in the SMB space. There is little opportunity for my ex-position at the company.
good,I do not care to participate. Why must I do this? It is unfortunate that you require me to write something. Would you please stop asking me to do this?
good,Not worth it. No place for advancement and management is terrible.  They never offer enough to the sales reps and would recommend going to other places like sprint or verizon.
good,"Comcast as a Company is one of the largest internet/tv cable providers in the US. Starting with the company my position was simple and rigid. I've heard of them and used to work for their competitor Time Warner as an installation technician. Saying that I've heard a multitude of horror stories of the service and being in the field and hearing a multitude of horror stories with Time Warner I came into the job albeit skeptical of the companies approach to customer service and ability to have a good relationship with its employees regardless of position. Comcast  cares about its image, and Comcast cares for its direct employees. Now my position is not truly direct. My position is hired in from Support.Com. and in turn my employer works for Comcast. But I get a call, I'm the voice the customer believes in as Comcast. I'm there to ensure a healthy relationship of the customer. I endure with the customer through hard times when an uncontrollable circumstance arises and we work through it together. I've had the Night shift with Technical Support and I'm now the day  shift with technical support and provided support and feedback for all my customers and the calls are those seeking help. Sometimes the service 'never had a problem until just recently' and sometimes the service is 'worst experience'.  But i understand my job and what that entails for the calls i expect as i was hired for. Comcast puts so much into inspiring techs to be better with taking all forms of feedback to better their image. The Training sessions are filled with adjustments to better the call taking procedure and"
good,"It's a sedentary job, and every minute is counted and bathroom breaks need to be deducted from your given break time. Although there are career advancement opportunities, you definitely have to have the right supervisor that supports you in climbing that ladder."
good,"Technicians are constantly stretched thin."
good,"Conservative culture and outdated processes. Their is very little direction, bad communication through out departments. Many inefficiencies which cause confusion and issues."
good,"When it came to the different benefits you receive for being an employee, they were amazing. Their technology was out of this world, but the only area of opportunity would be the accountability to be equal across all departments. Favoritisms was something that was practiced a lot taking away from ethics and true business behavior. Knowing me I’ll return, but not to the same department I was in."
good,"I was an Analyst and when it was busy there was so much to do and when it wasn't you needed to find ways to stay productive. the people were amazing,."
good,"A very manipulative group of employees, will get others to say anything they want, false reports, inaccurate investigations, specialists were even interrogated 1 on 1 in closed rooms. If you spoke against them they would turn on you , seen many false investigations and people wrongly fired because the clique didn't like them."
good,"Actively listening to calls, and giving advice during the call on how to sell. "
good,Comcast was a great company to work for.they were very accommodating to schedules and helped push you to progress through the company.great company to work for
good,"typical day at work. will start out with a lot of work on your route and throughout the day even more work will get added. they have service windows that are nearly impossible to make resulting in constantly adding work and moving work around because they over book the quota.  this company works you hard and has no memory of peoples service dedication. i have seen this company fire employees after 30 plus years of service without warning . This is an AT WILL EMPLOYER . this means they can and will fire you at anytime there is no union job protection or grievance filing process. "
good,"The best way I can describe any employee that is not sales or Manager and above at Comcast, think the others on Lost.  Spent most of my career making applications and reports that drove productivity and improved customer service.  Never appreciated for it.  Always the excuse that there were never enough slots in upper management."
good,"Management promotes friends and incompetent members to run business, pushes job to lower people because they do not know what to do. Rinse and repeat."
good,"Comcast has an old boy network of old school sales principles working in the 21th Century.  Compared to the wonderful modern advancements in technology, their viewpoints of the consumers are outdated, inflexible and misguided.  They believe that no matter the price, people should salivate for their product like a BMW.  While the Hyundai;s, Kia;s, Nissans and Toyota;s are quickly overtaking the market.  Price competition is an idea that is foreign to the company.  ""Build a Hummer and the masses will accept as a new standard"" is their blind rallycry.  "
good,"When I began my career at Comcast it seemed a good fit with my standards, over time that diminished to feeling like they were only trying to fill seats."
good,"Comcast is a nice place to work...be ready to play the game in the good ol boy network in order to promote or advance though.  The company is making strides to become better, so as a tech the stress levels are low but at times it can be overwhelming to say the least."
good,"I worked for Comcast for many years. The management has so much stress on them, although I would still make ethical decisions they are almost forced to allow any type of behavior to individuals getting sales that is the bottom line. I was not an employee that had a difficult time meeting the goals at all, however morals and ethics are things that I am not willing to let go, and frankly Comcast managers are able to do so easily. I would not recommend working there if you are not prepared for a stressful position that is a constant worry if you are able to keep your job, as well as meet the demands of the position. Get ready to see a Doctor."
good,"It’s okay"
good,When I worked there this job was completely stressful. Between all the calls they had to the management not always knowing what they were doing to the odd jobs they had us doing to save money it was to much.
good,the company has a great suite of products however the culture and sales process is toxic. the loyalty group is a awful team specificly customers call there to get help and as a agent you are incentivised based on how little you do for them in terms of money off or removal of unwanted or unused services. the reason is truly because of the commission. comcast leaves it to you to decide between taking home money to help your family or to give help to a customer. so whats anyone going to do. its rough as is a very intensive call center
good,"stressful, no guidance or help from management, to be patient, manager was never there for us and always complaining and demanding, finding help, the shift was at night"
good,pay and benefits are great. awesome working environment there is a lot of help especially if you have no prior call center or sales experience   the only thing that sucked was working weekend and nights .
good,"Representatives are constantly lying to customers about the bills/charges to get them off the phones.  Metric system must be passed every month. If 3 months are failed, you are released, 9 years with the company and I have never seen anyone make it to their retirement."
good,Poorly run at executive level. Very difficult to perform as cooperation and collaboration gives way to placing blame and passing the buck onto employees.  This position was not manageable with home life.
good,I helped customers who account was either suspended or about to be suspended. I collected payments in order to get service active. I set up appointment for new install or equipment.
good,I worked for Comcast for 5.5 years. They centered around “brand” for advancement. I pioneered several projects that are still live to this day and never got any credit for my role in creating processes. I decided to fly under the radar the last 2.5 years I was there due to how they operate. They’d take credit for inventing the wheel if no one disputed it. They changed policy and procedures constantly and chalked it up as an ever changing culture of which everyone is required to adapt to the business. This clogged the course for so many people as the balance between work and life were constantly disrupted. The list goes on and on....
good,"A day of work consisted of technician home visit for approximately 3 to 5 residential homes. "
good,"I worked for Comcast for 3 years and although the pay is very well, the management sucks they never back their employees and half of the staff is prejudice. If you are a single parent good luck with that they are not by any means flexible with the schedule, and are also not very understanding when it comes to your children being sick"
good,"Working at the Xfinity theater was fun because you got to talk to many people and listen to music. It was also extremely high stress depending upon the concert you were working and the ""type"" of guests who attended. It's a day of full standing for hours on end. Not payed much but you can listen to the music which is enjoyable. Live Nation doesn't like to give discounts on ANYTHING for the workers. Over all I would go back, not for everyone..."
good,Goals were constantly changing.The organizational structure was constantly changing.  It is very much a who you know work environment not who does the best job.
good,Fast paced work environment most of the time. Good and knowledgeable coworkers. Exposure to many types of equipment in several scenarios. I gained a lot of knowledge.
good,"call center requires you to be on the phones all day, with minimal break time, customer service and low pay income with low benefits and vacations...."
good,"Poor compensation, hourly rates barely increased over past 10 years. Poor Management. Expectations and work load continue to increase with no additional help or compensation"
good,"If you want to make it a career, it requires a great deal of political meandering, but as a entry level job it's a great place to pick up required skills for future jobs."
good,"I barely worked. We were a sub contractor for Comcast and Comcast did not send out any work, which left us workless and without money! Comcast just does not seem to be the place for sub contractors"
good,"Get ready to be called every name in the book."
good,"Everyday its about sales and not customer rating, if your sales goal are not meet this company does care about it employees. Its only about sales, sales, sales, but overall good company as long as sales goals are met"
good,Rigid corporate culture with little to no room for personal choice or autonomy.  too many customers or former customers that hate the company and have bad customer service reputation.
good,"I was in residential then moved to business.  Business treated me badly.   Never had a coaching session, I asked to move up or sit with someone.  Didn't get a chance"
good,Met great people but upper management moved to slow in promotions or implementation of things that would improve work environment.  They do try to lighten the stress of the job by having events and acknowledgement of staff achievements.
good,The pay is not competitive. I'm a highly sought after technician and Comcast would not pay what I was worth. Unfortunately for then they have a revolving door of employees. If they utilized the some of my suggestions we could turn it around again!!
good,Skills and knowledge do not advance your career. Enough said. The management in my area knew very little about the goals and accomplishments they expected me to exceed.
good,The position at this company was as a subcontractor. The subcontracting company and their supervisors were horrible. Bad subcontracting company and bosses.
good,"Minimum wage and although the training seems to be comprehensive, there are so many ways people need help, you can't learn them all. And there's no one to help you.  I waited almost 45 minutes for help one day.  The people are fairly nice and the work environment is fine.  I need to go to a supervisor to be able to pay bills and was told that while I was an excellent candidate and there were two openings, they only hired every six months!  What kind of company does that?  So I left."
good,"Needs a time keeping system besides of the word of others in the store in the same position."
good,"This job is stressful due to the company's policies changing almost everyday.  Job needs to improve so it can be employee friendly. I don't really think it is the company, the mangers do not know how to talk to people and they are for themselves. I meet a few good managers but most of them end up being the same."
good,Interacted and took care of customers needs. Temporary position. I was not there long enough to make a sound judgement. Other employees were pleasant to work for. I scanned returned items and placed for recycling in proper place for pick up and placed customers with appropriate associates to fit their needs.
good,"Company cares about profits, not the satisfaction of the customers in relationsh tonthe service which they are receiving "
good,"Hr, Management, and pay is horrible, in the Beaver Falls store. No management help, Comcast will change sale and policies without warning and leave you wondering on what to tell the customers. The company in the Pittsburgh Pa area is a joke. It's all about who you know in the company"
good,"In the past 6 months, we have been reorganized twice. There is not enough job stability among the teams here and most people fear for their jobs on a continuous basis"
good,"Depending on your job here, most are driven by numbers, and that is all they care about. Benefits are good. Discounted cable is nice. People are nice."
good,"As a whole.  The company is a great company to work for. On the installation side of things, there is a lot to learn constantly. Technology is always and forever changing."
good,"Typical day at Comcast can be very stressful from the moment you walk through the doors. Coaching agents on productivity; adherence, attendance and overall performance. The workplace is tense as if you are walking on egg shells."
good,"make you alot of promises and never come thru ,you are always at constent fighting with there open door policy witch is not true ."
good,"if you are a money motivated person then by all means comcast is for you. but if you have a family, or want to do anything else but work good luck.  while they have great benefits and pay they use you because of it. the pressure and you better do behavior was too much for me."
good,The money is good.... The mangers suck accept for a few- cooperate doesnt know how to run nothing and it shouldn't be this difficult
good,This company do not support diversity. There aren't many African Americans in leadership positions. They hand pick who they want to move up in the company. The environment is a good ol boys mentality. You cannot trust HR no more than you can trust the site director. There is a lot of shadiness that happens in leadership. Most people play their parts just to get paid.
good,"While the benefits and perks package is very good, the company struggles with finding a proper work life balance for employees."
good,You must be able to multi-task because you will be doing at lease 3 things a once. Plus you need to be very patient with the customers. But most days are very good.
good,Assisted customers with issues regarding their accounts.  Support staff was very helpful. Work environment  was comfortable. Was difficult to get 2 days in a row off.
good,"imagine a place where hundreds of people are talking, laughing, even yelling over the phones and throughout the building for low pay, no room for advancement unless you know someone, management who is only there to baby sit not help you advance and become a better employee- well that's COMCAST"
good,In this department everything was knew and no one really knew the product. Or the basics of our job duties in this department.
good,"They think of you as a number.  They don't really care about the employee or customer.  It's about money and numbers.  If you are not a favorite you will not make more money or advance. Management doesn't care about your family, you have to be a company man to get ahead in this company.  They discriminate against older workers, heterosexuals, and there is clearly reverse discrimination against white workers."
good,inbound sales calls relatively easy work for ok pay but the pay has been going down while standards have been going up promotion or transfer is a popularity contest management is very hands off and will only address a situation if absolutely required or if there is a benefit to the manager or supervisor involved if you can handle being treated poorly by customers and can make friends with the right people while still making big sales numbers its a great place but if you are not good at sales or are a head get work done kind of worker you'll be stuck in sales forever and will have your pay steadily cut back
good,"Slow seasons less money, little or no supervision, free work scheduling and able to be out in community. Dealing with customers on daily basis."
good,sighn up new and existing customers  to new subscriptions for tv internet and phone this was an out sourced compony contracted to comcast
good,"•	Communicates and develops rapport with customers, time management and organizational skills"
good,"Great Company, however severely lacks the opportunity to progress and grow within your skill set. Rather than invest in their dedicated employees, they choose to continually bring in outside applicants."
good,i liked comcast but the fact they fired me at 7mnths pregnant just because fmla kept denying my pregnancy leave claims that i had documentations to prove for all my appointments or days i had to leave work and go to the hospital is just beyond the most careless act and worst experience ever...now im stressing on how to make ends meet smh
good,"Comcast will help you jump start your career, however in the location I am currently are assigned there is no opportunity for growth"
good,"There was very little training or structure on what was wanted. Had VERY high, unobtainable goals for the area. Asked me to resign over the phone."
good,Well the only part that is horrible about this job is your supervisor acts like he doesn't want to help you at. Your double booked for time frames and they expect you to do 3 hours worth of work in an 1hr.
good,"Comcast is another great company to advance your career if you have the write leadership team. A typical day at Comcast would consist of marketing and sales to different regions to increase revenue. "
good,"If you are looking for growth this may not be the company, many CSR have been in the same position for 5+ years with no room for growth."
good,"is an equal opportunity employer and gives consideration for employment to qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion,  national origin, disability or protected veteran status."
good,"I had to great managers they leaf and the new manger just wanted a new staff, So I was put on the back burn tell the could get red of me."
good,Processed cash & credit card payments from customers. I learned to be more of a listener and management was very supportive and every aspect. My co-workers were fun to work with and supportive. The end of the day was the hardest due to closing and sometimes the system would not give us the correct numbers and we struggled to reconcile. The best part was when things would go smoothly.
good,Good entry level job that gains experience with building consumer relationships with the company.
good,Helped me learn the advertising and production end of the business as well as on air talent hosting and directing programming.
good,"Center is no longer open, has been relocated oversees.  Was a great company to work for had many opportunities for growth and advisement."
good,"Working for Comcast, Is fast paced with no personal train. everything is rushed and thrown into the job. there is a nice call center work environment to work in. Most co-workers are unprofessional. the hardest part of the job is knowing the information to give customers due to lazy training trying to run around the office for answers. the most enjoyable part of the job is crazy hat day and over all fun Friday with in the office to keep you motivated."
good,Was a good experience to improve my customer services skills. Learn about technology and other related themes. Nice people able to help and a nice atmosphere as a work place.
good,Customer has an issue so i fix the issue. I learned that i never can get to much info for my job. Management is okay. I get along with all my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is learning that every customer is different. Solving the customers issue is very enjoyable.
good,Company is driven by sales as they care less about each individual.
good,"typical day at work is 10 hours daily,  low pay compared to competitors, no lunch, co workers are great and the free cable is cool."
good,typical day of raking people over the coals so comcast can make another buck.
good,"My day is filled with escalations from all over the country and still trying to coach my agents to do better. At the same time, I have a manager that is always micro managing me."
good,"Comcast  definitely has a fun environment with a great benefits package. However, there is no room for advancement. Advancement is not  given on performance ratings but moreover on who employees are connected with within the department. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you will probably be in the same position for years to come with little to know advancement opportunities. The most enjoyable part is talking with each and every customer from a variety of backgrounds in an attempt to solve their issues."
good,"They set expectations that are hard to reach.  They definitely pick their favorites and if you are lucky to be one of those people, you will advance in the company and do very well there."
good,"I worked in the Call Center in regards to billing, repair & sales. I then transferred to the Operations Department as a Receptionist and handled light accounting duties."
good,"Take 50-100 calls per day. Offerning assitance to customers regarding billing information, transfer of service and sellin Comcast products and service. Achieve Day personal and team goals."
good,"Comcast micromanages   when it is not needed.  your time away for things such as going to the bathroom is noted, once training is over you are pretty much expected to know everything and help is hard to find."
good,None supportive old school management. Awesome people work here however they drive employee dry in attempt to get more more more
good,"Constant disgruntled customer calls, no true resolution to solve issues. Trouble shooting services, poor system programming. I learned that you cannot take customer service personally. I enjoyed my coworkers, they made the atmosphere more manageable."
good,"customers calling in regarding billing, to high or not correct or cable not working, technicians no shows, etc.  Customers upset using bad language, but still have to sell and reach our quota for the day not easy when customers are upset.  the hardest part of the job customer being disrespected by the customers and non-professional supervisors and management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get a satisfied, grateful customer and you solve their problem plus meeting your goals at the end of the month and big commission."
good,"the day starts 9:30 am - 7:00pm knocking on residential doors, I learned door to door res. selling is a different animal, co-workers great, hardest part of job fixing what the installers fail to do, People"
good,"- typical day consist of interacting with an array of different customers "
good,"There are many things that are great about Comcast: many resources to pull from, industry leader, nearly-free cable/internet/phone service, day-to-day variety. But the biggest downside to Comcast is the state of controlled chaos everyone is constantly in. Things get done, but you are constantly asked to do more with less. Staffing levels are decreasing but the workload continues to increase. This leads to a lot of overworked, stressed employees who are too frazzled from just trying to get by that they can't focus on the small details that make the biggest difference, which leads to mistakes. There is also no loyalty to the employees. You can be fired just as easily if you are a call center trainee screwup or a manager with 30 years with the company and a stellar record. Don't ever get too comfortable in the position you're in. You can (and will) be replaced/removed eventually."
good,"Comcast is a good place to work, but they have forced me to take a job in another dept since my job moved to Pittsburgh. The job is not being explained well by managment, and is making me look for a change."
good,"I worked 60 hours a week, I learned to manage my time better, how to be patient with people. My co-workers were very kind and welling to assist you with more training. The hardest part of the job was knocking on peoples doors. I enjoyed the training and meeting new people that other wise I would not have ever spoke."
good,Difficult to advance within call center environment unless in the click. Lots of pressure to sell. Recommend working for this employer in a non-call center role.
good,"The job is unorganized. Management doesnt care about employees, i wasted 4 years of my life there."
good,"If you are loyal to this job and learn its craft then you will be weeded from the herd of technicians, and called upon daily. No day brings the same trouble, and even the same problems often require different fixes. Days are long and time is short. Management is a false image of support, just lost puppy dogs in search of those ever illusive numbers. The system is setup to place it's ineffectiveness on it's technicians rather than the system, and your job is constantly playing a game of Russian Roulette with your assigned jobs and time in which you have them completed. It's a very big system that has outgrown the novelty of quality in favor of the need of quantity, and the technicians bare the brunt of the downside. Someone has to be blamed. The one bright spot is the co workers and the knowledge you gain from there experiences. The hardest part is knowing there are few boundaries in which the company doesn't want you to cross in order to please it's clientele, but this often comes at the expense of oneself. For me I'm a people person so just meeting new people everyday and doing cable, made the minutia of the office and management worth the job."
good,"Working at Comcast was fine, the people and management were friendly and eager to help. However, there were no metrics that needed to be met. This made it difficult to stand out amongst peers as our performance was not and could not be measured. This caused an overwhelming sense of job insecurity. Sure enough, the call cente had closed after 2 years a d our jobs were moved elsewhere."
good,"Comcast overall is an OK company to work for. A typical day at work can be pretty stressful, and the pay/benefits does not match the workload. Comcast as a communications company should work more on the communication within the company between departments. My co-workers and supervisors are fun to work with, and I learn a lot from them everyday. There is job security, if you meet metrics which can be challenging at times."
good,Worked as a temp for this company. Job seemed to offer great perks but temps werent allowed to participate in any of the advances.
good,Overall I enjoyed working for this company. I learned a lot and wouldn't mind working for them again.
good,•Provide customer services about all products to new and existing customer .
good,"The training is very detailed, over the years managment lost controll of the local popularity due to coperate office forced the jobs to other locations, even india."
good,The job seemed like a good job when I first started but it went downhill once I got settled in. There is a “go go go” workload put on your route throughout the day which takes away from the customer service because you are worried about making the next appointment on time. The job will do damage to your body due to the fact that you will have to carry an 80lbs ladder countless times a day. You will not have a balanced life because jobs are set up as trouble calls so that they can push more jobs out per day when you get there it will actually be a install.
good,"always changing schedule and many roles to play, you do billing, sales, and tech support. You don't have a permanent work stations and share desks. You have to be flexible because things are constantly changing."
good,I have been with the company almost 6 years and it ha been going downhill. Hourly pay does not compare to what you have to do and deal with on a daily basis. District management has no clue how to do their jobs or hire qualified management. Company expects you to give your life to them with no extra perks.
good,Lots of job security.   Greet office space and lots of activities to do on breaks   The people are always willing to help   The work is always changing
good,"This company is not a bad company to work for, it just depends on who your management team is. People always say, people don't leave jobs, they leave managers and that is the case for me."
good,"Company offers great benefits such as Health insurance, free cable and internet, 401k, pto, etc. There is a lot of favoritism and people get promoted based on who they know and not what their skills are. Goals are high and you have to deal with angry customers all day."
good,"When I started this job as a Field Technician,  I quickly began to love it, because I was constantly on the move,  never in the same place all the time and getting the chance to stay in front of various technology.  These parts of the job was always the greatest benefits.  The down side is where the field management contradict themselves at every turn. They speak as if they have your best interests in"
good,My experience working for Comcast for 5yrs had its ups and down. Pay starting off was great but once the commission scale changed the pay was not the same. They base it off of your previous 3months of a customers history. There is no way to really truly see what your performance metrics are. Management only cares about themselves. The stress outweighs the pay!!!!! High stress job!
good,After 20 years getting shuffled out-poor way to treat valuable employees.  The industry has changed so fast that my current position isn’t tenable-streaming services are killing us.
good,Comcast offers great benefits. There is very little work life balance. It is a great place for someone that does not mind taking work home. overall they treat you well.
good,"Management has been toxic,  has fired whole departments. always changing the pay and commission structure, and pushing sales!  High turnover rate."
good,"As a Regional Manager I had a team and handled 3 markets.  I really enjoyed my direct leadership and the company has best in class product.  Internal processes and support were an ongoing challenge.  I experienced white collar resentment in my role and was on call seven days a week, no work life balance.  Culture is conducive to those that have no interest in thinking outside the box."
good,Intense sales pressure.  If you don't make your sales you will be fired.  Out of team of 8 sales reps. I have seen 40 reps quit or were terminated in the last 7 years.
good,Great benefits people are fun..comcast only cares about their bottom line...money.. upper management is disconnected the employees and things change all the time.
good,"The benefits are amazing. The culture is demanding of blind faith and utter loyalty without question, focusing far too much on personal brand. Cultish"
good,terrible manageement and lack skill. no room for growth very cut throat. unable to acquire new skill.  retaliation for speaking up.  hard environment to work in
good,"May have layoffs. The old boys network still abounds. In some cases you can work there and never experienced a layoff, but in other cases you could risk reorganization as soon as you get there."
good,Highly stressful especially  working in a call center environment. It's  difficult  to move into other departments because  of your metrics  and they give the spiel about like to hire from within which is a lie.
good,The culture is To sell No matter what department you’re in. No room For advanced. High turnover rate. Poor management. Your tenure means nothing. Unprofessional environment.
good,Great company management is horrible n looks at employees as a number n easily replaced................The benefits and pay are wonderful if the company valued their frontline employees I would consider staying.The management make your work environment super stressful
good,"I did my job at Corporate and did it well.  Department does not matter.  Quite clear that Comcast heavily values minority and special interest groups.  That is excellent.  Comcast pays lip service to veterans in my opinion."
good,It’s a sad place to work if you want to be a technician. Stressful and everyday you’re ready to quit. Upper management makes it a drag. I wouldn’t recommend it
good,"Not too bad of a company and benefits are top notch, i was a tech support representative so the job was already horrible as it is, then add the fact that you talk to the most horrible kind customers on every call."
good,"Great benefits.  Fair pay.  Little work life balance.   They will find reasons to give you bad reviews and let you go for no reason other than age.  I was the number 1 home security producer in the region, and above average in every other catagory.  I was let go when they consolidated stores.  They said that I ""wasn't the right fit""   That means that there is no reason to let you go, other than the fact that you are too old."
good,"I don't have anything to say. The culture is messy and  immature.The company is great, but the culture is not the best work environment. I nothing to say."
good,After a year we parted ways. Happiest day of my life. This wasn't  a good fit. My family had an emergency and the next thing I learned was I was out...
good,Benefits and pay good job benefits and pay benefits and pay and cable tv great cable and internet love the perks and benefits and universal passes we. Get
good,I work at the Spectrum. It's not there anymore. I was in great shape when I worked there. There were no good concert's except Aerosmith W/ George Therogood. Wresting was the worst
good,"worked mainly as consultant, atmosphere can get political depending on where you land working. "
good,Was disappointed how they handled promotions. There is a DOS system that was used to find areas of serviceability. The hardest part of this job is the charge backs.
good,"Everyone at work is very nice and willing to lend a hand if you need help with something.  What was not mentioned by the recruiter or company was contractor furloughs.  I didn't find out about them until after starting work.  Many groups / teams feel ""siloed"" and it is sometimes difficult to communicate and get information among them.  They are a meeting-heavy organization so there are always lots of meetings.  The meetings aren't always in the same building either--there are several Comcast buildings, as well as monthly meetings sometimes happening at the Barnes Foundation.  The work day is your standard 9am-5pm.  There aren't many people who stay after 5pm, which is nice for work life balance.  Being in Center City, the traffic and parking situation is very lousy, but the food options are great.  The Comcast Center building and the newer Comcast Technology Center building both have cafeterias where you can buy food (they don't take cash).  There is also the underground Suburban Station Concourse under the Comcast Center with a few shops."
good,"The company has it's good and it's bad depending  upon which department that you are in. The turnover speaks for itself. You are not recognized for your loyalty, your hard work or being a devoted, committed employee. It's all based on numbers. The customer really doesn't come first as they like to preach, it's all about lining their pockets."
good,Good company - yet some management hiring managers and Human Resource partners are not strong and in need of consultation. Others have good follow through.
good,Company need to restructure the sale protocols. The customers hated any communication from the company. Clients often complained about rising prices and never really knowing how much their bill is going to be.
good,"istalling cable converters modems into customer's homes repairing damaged cable inside and outside homes educating customers on products "
good,Typical day covers many different projects and operational tasks with an ever-changing priority in a volatile work environment.  Learning is available with university level type training available.  Management is ever-changing and seems to lack caring for its people with an ad-hoc directional focus on strategies.  Culture is wanting to be something that they are not and forcing a square peg into a round hole sometimes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and cross-functional relationships with other departments and teams.  It allows an individual to grow their business acumen.
good,good place to work great benefits but pay is low. too low for the cost of living in our area a lot of disconnect between upper management and middle mngmt. too much pressure for the pay compensarion.
good,"Used to be about establishing relationships with clients in order to grow and maintain longterm clientele. Became more about bottom line. Focus shifted to internal metrics rather than customer needs."
good,This job is all sales motivated and consistent high service/sales marker you must make or you will not have a future at Comcast .. Job is for a person with a sales background ..
good,A lot of drama with  bosses and employees all work no pay at the end a lot of charge back very greedy people and only care for self very unprofessional
good,"It’s terrible working for a call center , Comcast is no exception , same point system applies to this call center as with all of them , only compensation is free cable"
good,Great Benefits. Senior Leadership still is not engaged or in touch with the needs of its customers and  employees. Move to different departments every 2-3 years if the opportunity arises
good,Poor work. Ing environment. Supervisors were chosen on a friend basis or for the fact that they were skilled technician and never for their human relations or personality.
good,"You are required to be in office drama, If not then you are not a team player."
good,"It depended on what department/area you got into. There was not a true cohesive unit feel, and the blame from one department that did not do something that another department needed by a certain time frame, was always being shifted."
good,"I was there six years, I had 4 mangers, and six directors, three different VPs in that time."
good,"Comcast is an AMAZING company to work for.... as long as you're not a field technician. As a technician I was routinely blamed for situations well outside of my control by both customers and management alike. Management, or at least my manager in particular, was unequipped to properly train and develop their employees which led to their ""numbers"" being low which constituted many unnecessary meetings which talked about the problem but never fixed it. Comcast over the years has had a bad reputation when it comes to their customer base, which is why the company was, when I was working there, extremely focused on making an impact for their customers, at the expense of their employees. The saying ""the customer is always right"" is true to an extent, however when your livelihood is put on blast for whether or not a customer ""liked"" you, there is a flaw in the system. Overall the benefits are what kept most employees around and because they were actually great, most employees were trapped in a situation that they just couldn't leave, giving Comcast the ultimate power over their livelihood. Pay increases were rare and next to nothing when they were received and the quarterly bonus was maybe a day of works worth. The atmosphere as a technician is depressing to say the least as literally every other branch can somehow blame the customers misfortunes or communication errors on you and as the tech, you will be the one to receive the brunt of the anger. Overall it was a great job with paid training in a classroom setting and a decent enough pay (although nowhere NEAR enough to be able to"
good,"I love work Ing for Comcast however they don’t pay nearly enough to even survive. $4.00 above minimum wage doesn’t nearly get me by day by day. I’m averaging 40k a year which is 60,000.00 less than the average “low income” around the area. Tegh’s are continuing to struggle out here and Comcast doesn’t even bat a eye. Treat your lower tier employees better and maybe turnover wouldn’t be so high."
good,The environment at comcast is rewarding if you are on the right side of the office politics. The California region has a great way of rewarding people who are playing the right political games. Ensure that if you are working here that you do not ruffle the wrong feathers.
good,"Ok for the pay but very little chance for advancement"
good,"The company itself is not bad, but the pay is. The pay is nowhere near where it should be for the amount of work required to be put in. The benefits are good though."
good,Training provided on a regular basis. They make too many changes to job tools and policies.Make it difficult for expense reimbursement.They only care about the next deal not building relationships.
good,"Comcast is a good company, but they care more about lawsuits than doing what right for employees and customers. They will toss good people aside but allow misconduct from others. If they focused on work then they wouldn't have a poor reputation."
good,"Great place to work. Great people. Management was great as well. Health package, 401k, and stock options. Good place to get your feet wet in the sales industry. Cable package is free, a great benefit. Challenging quotas, but attainable."
good,"High Stress, Management doesn't truly care about the people.  They give you false sense of security just so you'll keep doing your job.  Their open door policy is not truly open door.  Don't file a grievance or you could loose your job."
good,Comcast is fun place to work only due to the coworkers  Management is not great they only care about sales. Its very stressful never get to see family
good,"I worked in the Cancelation Department very streesfull  every day,,  best part when you retent  a customer from cancelation...A typical day , was  angry customers trying to cancel the services and my job was to make the customer change their mind, and stay with the company"
good,"I worked for comcast as a technician for 5 years, once new management came in, everything changed we as technician were pushed to the limit to get more work done. Be ready to work like a robot."
good,"Department is fairly new, there is constant change. Not a bad thing until its to much change at once. I've learned a lot in my role, such as seeing the value in building relationships with not just the customer but internally with the company. the hardest part of my job would be that there is a lot not in my control that I get held accountable for being in my control. The most enjoyable part would be the flexibility."
good,Comcast the company is a great company to work for. It just depends on what department and what center. I worked at a center where it was favoritism and bias.
good,"Pay and benefits were great. Advancement depended on who you were friends with. Some of the worst people have been promoted after terrible acts at work, because they had the right friends. Theft, lying and scamming customers is OK if you're making money."
good,Company has poor executive management in place today.  Lots of implementation issues as they cannot deliver what we sell or clients.  No light at the end of the tunnel.  They heed some executive level changes and new guidance.
good,"We support cable, internet and phone activation. Typically the work in a day is just quite stress and easy at the same because of being familiar with the nature of the job"
good,The people at Comcast make the job fun.  The relationships built and the bonds last longer than the job.  Pay for performance and abilities is not a priority
good,Company is great and benefits are huge and pay is awesome. If you're in management be prepared to work and never see your family. I was an ASM at a retail location and my boss refused to work nights or weekends so I had to without exemption. Tenured employees do what they want.
good,I was grateful for my job with Comcast.  It was stressful because there isn't really any job security.  Turnovers are quite high and it seems they start firing a lot of people towards the end of the year.
good,Busy days on M-Tue but I learned how to schedule payment and troubleshoot TV issues. Hardest part is lack of support and the most enjoyable is helping
good,"a typical day at work was either spent looking for a sup or they were at the desk but unavailable, senior sups were unwilling to communicate about these issues and it lead to a work environment of people generally not caring, promises of compensation for sales that were later changed to not pay for sales, promises of career advancement compensation that had unrealistic goals and catered tho those that cheated the numbers"
good,"Management did all they could but there were many times they would influence you to ""get over"" on the customer and being the type of person I am, I simply could not work there so it led to my departure."
good,"Disorganized and changing goals - most managers were all long-term employees who worked up to management whether capable or not.  Very old boys club.  Very poor tools, most of which were home grown without documentation and not very accurate."
good,"Although the benefits are great, the hourly compensation is below market value. Even though job security is a myth , there's even less of that here.Not a bad place to start if you're looking for an entry level job."
good,"The culture at Comcast was okay, not alot of support at times from Management.The people were great, and also the benefits were good. A chance to win prizes"
good,"This position was extremely stressful. Management changed often as well as policies and procedures. There was no flexibility in scheduling, and no exceptions for tardiness even if 1-2 minutes late due to traffic or emergency. Very strict attendance policy. Commission structure was changed frequently so it was hard to tell what you should be paid based off of sales acquired. Steady 40 hours a week, great insurance and discounts on cable services."
good,"Its great to work independently and travel to various job sites in a day. However, the management is very disrespectful to frontline employees. Pay is not competitive"
good,disengaged leaders is at the core of poor experiences. The organization is however undergoing considerable changes that should address some of these issues.
good,in a nutshell this company is good just not the houston region i have a few friends who work in other places and they all say the same thing of how great it is and when i tell them what happens here they all say that would never happen where they are
good,productive and fun workplace with ping pong table its an safe an clean warehouse to work in its people friendly an the mangers look out for the whole staff
good,"taking calls/fixing customer issues/selling a service"
good,"If you like phone work and commission pay this might be the job for you. You can move up fast if you have a desire to go into management. You can also make alot "
good,"micro manage, chained to a desk. management tracks when you have to use the rest room. benefits are good, cons management will change your schedule within a week regardless of what they promised when hired. even though it was a verbal agreement what was  required off before accepting the position. HR walks around when approach about a subject or issue, they talk to you in a demeaning way, I guess they feel everyone is beneath them...."
good,It's a sale environment that has recently lost all moral with management style and fear of retaliation for reporting just everyday issues as part if the job
good,"Work was boring.  Manager gave no assistance in helping you learn what was needed to complete the job.  As a contractor you are treated as an outsider.  Seemed peculiar to hire someone and then not help them onboard to become productive.  I felt like I was hired just to burn a pot a discretionary funding the manager had.  Priorities change daily and managers can be nice one day then miserable to you the next given the constant changing of priorities.  There is a dog eat dog culture."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work with good pay and benefits, but there's various challenges within the process that makes the job very stressful at times."
good,"Extremely metric driven. Constant changes in work processes, required applications, and products, yet virtually no training. New tools, and required processes are sent via email or text and you are expected to teach yourself on your own time."
good,I enjoy what I have been doing for the past 10 years . The job itself is not bad but on the other hand the goals are not achievable. It's has become increasingly difficult to meet the metrics honestly. I use to feel like I had job security but do not any longer.
good,"As with any company, if the people chosen to lead have never actually done the frontline job for the channel which they manage, they rarely make decisions that translate well to the productivity level or cultural improvement of said business channel. Sadly, that has been the case over the previous 2 years at Comcast, and a cultural rot has started to take hold within many channels that I only forsee worsening."
good,The workplace was good though it was difficult to work within the specifics for which I was hired.  The continued changed with work requirements were challenging.
good,"install cable tv and cable modems for customers"
good,"You've all heard about the reputation of Comcast. Well everything you heard is true.  The pay is mediocre, the benefits are ok if free services are what you seek.  The environment is very stressful and you have to work very hard to make your goals month to month.  There is a lot of shady business that goes on that will get you fired if you aren't careful so you have to make sure you aren't selling unethically.  Management and staff are both overworked so it doesn't allow much time for work life balance.  Going into the situation it isn't hard to tell why there is a high turnover rate.  If you can stand it, you may be able to grow with the company but I wouldn't look forward to it.  The best advice I can offer is get in, get what you can and get out quickly without turning back. Even the benefit of free service isn't worth the headache.  BUYER BEWARE!"
good,The job has excellent benefits but the calla are literally back t back to back n o breathing room you have to deal with a lot of irate customers supervisor and managers are not that helpful at times
good,Comcast is a large company with a lot of different departments. Once you grow in seniority you have a better chance of obtaining a schedule you are comfortable with.
good,"Comcast does not care about there employees time or anything they have to do, work life balance is not there. I am not paid fairly for the amount of work that i do l."
good,"Great benefits and pay, high stress environment, good people, leadership committed and driven to success and growth. Always living on the edge for career stability, had several major changes in structures which resulted in job losses even with tenured employees."
good,"A day at comcast will include to make sure customer service has been met with each customer interaction. Verifying customer information and accurately identify the customer. Taking payments, trouble shooting services that are not working, and always remember to document each account you open."
good,company doesnt care about employees work them like slaves and pay little of nothing customer service sucks crazy hours open 365 days have to bid for holidays pay sucks for a company who is making so much money
good,I worked in telesales. It was part time so it was only good for supplemental income. I learned that I do not like telesales and will likely never return.
good,"Poor management team at Arlington office."
good,"In 16 years, 20 total in all with the company and different owners.  I had always been respected and worked well in the company "
good,"the environment  is fun sometimes but people starts to point fingers. and you can tell the superiors only wants to help their team. but other than that, they give out a lot of free shirts and comcast cups and water bottles."
good,Meeting new people via phone and assisting them in their cable needs was a typical day at work. I enjoyed changing  customers mind about Comcast customer service representatives.
good,Shipping and Receiving manager Ordering inventory and placing it in the proper places across the retail store.  Some Clerical duties as well
good,"The work is fine, the staff isnice, the manager is a horrible micro manager with untreated anxiety. She never leaves me alone to get my work done. I've stayed late after work trying to convince her that I need to shut down my computer, I need to shut down my IM chats (she's sending me chats from home by the way, she's already left the office). Nothing I do is right and she I get it right, she refuses to notice that I did it right."
good,greeting customers to discuss new products and billing.m switching out equipment that is defective. selling product for a quota in productivity along with stocking back warehouse with service equipment
good,I analyze data to direct business decisions for my group of 200+ vendors processing trouble tickets. I greatly enjoy the variety and many tasks going on at the same time. I'd like to expand my role and dig into the analytics piece more as this position is heavy on vendor management rather than analytics.
good,"A typical day would consist of answering incoming phone calls about technical issues with cable/internet/phone services. This company taught me how to be patient, because you cannot see what the customer is doing on the other side of the phone so you have to do your best to be calm and explain the process in great detail. Management was very supportive while in training (7-8 weeks), but once I went to the floor on my own it was very hard to find management. My desk was seated far away from my co-workers due to mass employment and little time getting every cubicle up and running. The hardest part of this job was keeping a positive outlook with the company with the poor treatment after training. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the customer say their problem was fixed with my help."
good,With newer additional leadership the company has become all about the company and cost cutting in a way that brings everyone down in the office. I have never seen or worked with such a sad group of people and all for the mighty dollar and greedy corporate finance teams.
good,This company provides a stable place to work. The benefits the company provides are good. The work schedule is quite flexible.
good,"Long hours, fast paced, good money, good perks, poor managers. All about the numbers, number of subscribers, treated the techs poorly"
good,"The hardest part of the job is finding representatives that actually want to come to work daily and do the job that they were hired to do.  As management, we work 6 days a week and the reps usually work 5 days a week, about 20 hours total and get paid for a full time job"
good,Great products and services but really needs to focus on customer relations and empower employees to fix issues quickly and effectively.
good,"A good technology company. Senior leadership has a great vision and has a good pulse on the industry."
good,"No matter how compartmentalized the different orgs and departments are, you'll always be no more than a number.  If you're in sales, you're only as good as your last month's productivity.  If you're ok with that and you like to play politics...  This is the place for you!"
good,"Hectic work atmosphere but met co-operative people."
good,"I don't know what area I will be dispatching or get info about it if it's a new area. Co-workers are the greatest, always willing to help."
good,"As stated, at one time it was a nice place to work, but with so many many management changes, the moral of the employees is on a steady decline."
good,"Company is run by management who is out of touch with technology, QA and Dev Teams were asked to relocate to a new city only to have the project end in 2 months time."
good,"A typical day varies at this particular call center. Specific days may be faster then others,It does teach discipline because you have to be very patient with the customers. Management could be more accurate. I did enjoy talking to different people daily to make my day go by as well as learning about them. The co-worker were very nice."
good,"I prefer not to review Comcast as I do not want to speak negatively about the company, because there would be a lot of negativity."
good,"Typical day includes getting yelled at by irate customers who don't understand their billing statements & don't want to listen to the information your explaining to them. "
good,They work load was fine but the company was dysfunctional. There is no flexibility with the shifts. The open doors policy was not so much open door.
good,"The hardest part of the job was undefined demands on employee time/focus-varies by supervisor drastically."
good,this is a great place to work for depending on what your're looking for. If you get to bid on a great shift. some of the shift times aren't that great but overall a great place.
good,"The biggest problem with the organization is the poor customer service provided post-sale. Unfortunately, I could not relocate to Jacksonville due to family and health issues."
good,"Troubleshoot technical problems with Phone, Internet, and TV in people's homes, and occasionally in businesses."
good,"Very high pressure, management not in touch with reality.  Lots of metrics to follow.  Hard to get promotions. Has great community involvement.  Wonderful benefits."
good,"good company, not great in promotion to leadership. salary could be more for job responsibilities. hardest part is company not being flexible on inclement weather days."
good,"comast was an ok employer, i ended up losing my job because i got injured onsite, and they gave me ""hush"" money, then fired me."
good,"•	Elicits and records customer information and inquiries, following prompts from a computerized system."
good,"a typical day at work, is answering calls all day, taking new customers cable, tv, and phone orders. Help with explaining the bill to the customers"
good,"The job is a wonderful job,I loved to assist customers ,not too much room for growth.Training was excellent ,I did learn the most every on the job."
good,"Comcast provides a great work environment, the hours however arent so great neither is the pay."
good,"Typical example of a mega corporation cycling in and out of the employers market all of the desperate and unsuspecting hard working people, line up by the dozens for each job, to try and have a ""Career"". When those division managers decide they want to hit their bonuses and propel them well into the low 6 figures, they do so by cutting dozens upon dozens employees, or whole departments underneath them to make themselves look better to their senior RVPs and exempt themselves of the blame for why their dept was failing. I've watched this happen 4 times since I was there and was a product of the exact treatment myself. "
good,days are fast paced and there is a constant  change in products l so things change daily team environment is good-trying to take in procedures changing can be overwhelming if not  willing to learn new things -the products as they have change and the more a product advances
good,Retention department is the most hardest department to be in.  Trying to win over customer who where very unhappy with the service.
good,This was a temporary position through a temporary agency and the assignment came to an end.
good,"I was not fond of Comcast because the management was very catty  the calls never stopped and you got scolded for the smallest things, ( standing while on a call)"
good,fast pace would need to try and up sell customers on there different packages.  Learned how to multi-task on up to 15-20 different systems. Learned how to troubleshoot and assist customers with getting systems back up and running when services were down.
good,Comcast is a fun place to work when there is prizes involved the environment there is team friendly drives you to work on your own. the benefits are good and you have three weeks vacation just coming into the company. the department I was in was sales and it was hard! Mentally knowing your job depends on sales coming up with a way to sale all different kinds of people and remaining honest. you are giving notice when the shift changes and given a month to basically switch your entire life but its not a good balance when you have small children because the company  does not rotate  weeks at all you either use all your vacation on supporting  your kids on Saturdays or miss all of the best moments
good,"I kept busy with marketing initiatives assisting executives as well as several client,  A fast paced business with on the job training availability,  I was hoping this would have been a long term employment, however the firm started to outsource employees and hire from other countries.  This in turn ended in my reason for being laid off."
good,"No Advancement opportunity. Pay is good cable is kinda sorta free, Management is poor. Need to hire more competent people."
good,Here at Comcast the overall benefits are great but the sales teams are a work in progress.
good,"This company offers the ability to work at home with the requirement of a great internet connection, specific equipment, and a computer that has Windows XP only. The management is very cautious, but friendly."
good,door to door sales rep. work alone learned to take no for an answer
good,On a daily basis you get cursed out & verbally abused by customers. from the Supervisors & Management teams there is little support. upervisors want to deligate and never wants to do their job. people who actually do there job correctly are not appreciated. The agents who refuse to disconnect accounts and cheat to get to the top are the ones who get recognition & rewards. You have managers who are sleeping w/ agents or pulling strings to get them in supervisor or Trainer positions. The people who get offline positions are those who are friends of the management staff.
good,Great place to work however days can be long. Some of the jobs were in not to sanitary settings.
good,"Company is good place to work with. Employees are very professional and so are the managers I have worked with."
good,The great thing about working for Comcast is that it was a well known company and provided good benefits. The main flaw with the position is that it's very stressful and nothing's being done about it. I've seen several people go on stress leaves and take medications just to be able to remain a productive employee there.
good,Work sometimes 10 to 12 hours on a hard day. I learned the mechanics of the job and that there aren't any cookie cutter systems in place. They simply would not work in that sales environment. Management changed so often that it was sometimes hard to follow as well as co-workers. Co-workers were a good group of people to be around and work with. The hardest part of the job was working the hours and not having anything to show for it.The most enjoyable part was helping people get the services and more that they wanted while paying less for them.
good,"Door to Door not fun in the city of chicago. You waist your time signing up the same customers that dont pay their bills. Take the 6,000 you get in training and quit."
good,"Great name and company to add  your resume. That is all. Comcast doesn't care for it's customer base it just wants to oversaturate until it's the ONLY cable company in the world."
good,"Very, almost insulting low pay.  Even after years of being in the business you still make nothing.  Also no communication.  No advancement."
good,"Take for 40-50 per day, resolve billing issues, great friendly co-wokers"
good,I enjoy the job but there Is no room for advancement and is commission based. Great Company to work for but I am seeking a career.
good,"Working as a direst sales representative the compensation at comcast is extremely good if you hit your quotas. The benefits are also excellent. That being said, the quotas are incredibly hard to hit (only 13% of the sales staff in our region have hit quota for the last 2 quarters) and falling slightly below quota leads to a massive dip in salary. Leadership seams to be trying to change the TOXIC corporate culture at comcast but I'm not confident in their ability to overcome the social inertia of the organization. They also put inordinate amounts of pressure on you to work on personal time in order to bring numbers up for there sales report, and have consistently taken both tools and incentives away from the sales staff while still expecting them to sell more."
good,If you don't like to sell this is NOT the place for you. I did enjoy my time here. They do train you and try to promote within.
good,"A typical day at Comcast involves very detailed oriented shift work. The inbound sales team works very hard to assimilate what the customer wants and needs with available products to make an overall Awesome Customer Experience. The protocol is to PROBE and find what the Customer is interested in, as well as family size, and what other options the customer may need for a complete household effectiveness. "
good,As long as a technician did his job he was left alone to do his or her work in the field
good,Comcast is a great company to work for! I would recommend or reffer people to this company.
good,"it was a job.. nothing to discuss; enjoyed the free cable and internet, considering I was not getting paid as much an hour."
good,"Comcast was fun to work but unless you know someone , you will find yourself stuck in one position. Their is a lot of favortism there and Constant issues with  payroll. The training is nothing like the Real world so they hype you up, then the game changes once you get  on the floor. I did learn how not to take No for an answer, you have goals to meet, plain and simple! Other agents steal your sales, supervisors do nothing about it. It is very cut throat! "
good,"A typical day at Comcast would involve answering inbound sales calls from customers interested in cable, internet, or phone service. Having daily meetings on new products and promotions was also part of the job. I learned about the technical side of how cable systems work, I learned new computer skills, sales skills, people skills, and human resources skills. The management at Comcast in my particular department led by intimidation mostly, and threatened termination often. The overall working environment was very hectic and disorganized. My co-workers were fantastic. I worked with the company for 8 years and really did enjoy the work, and the individuals I worked with. The hardest part of the job was the unrealistic expectations the company often expected. I felt expendable every day I came to work. Having absolutely no feeling of job security every work day makes a person very uneasy. I realize that in any sales environment there will be stress and expectations, but the goals that were set by management could almost never be met. It almost seemed as if they did it on purpose so employees would not obtain their full commission bonus. These are some of the hardest parts of the job. The most enjoyable part for me was the satisfaction of provided great experiences to the customers. Individuals would call in and I would be able to give them a full education on products they knew nothing about. They were very appreciative for the assistance I gave. It made me feel really great to be such a help. "
good,"Core job outline and pay structure changes to much to plan ahead with any certainty. What you are getting paid for and your plan of action could be completely wiped out two weeks later and will be by constant policy changes within the company which will not be review because they come from way up a disconnected corporate chain of ""yes men"" managers. This has been the case nearly every 2 to 3 weeks for the last two years I have been employed in this position at Comcast."
good,"In my previous job at Comcast, I was responsible for organizing, planning, and executing events to promote company’s products, increase brand awareness, and gain new customers, while negotiate sponsorships in different levels to achieve company’s goals."
good,"For everyone who has attempted or applied to comcast this is for you. I Applied for comcast and got the job. I was told what my job duties where straight away. I didn't miss a day in the 90 day period and I excelled in the training as I have formal training in everything they where teaching. The co workers where fantastic. Most if not all where cheery to be around and genuine. The management is another story. All around Shady management and deceitful managers who don't take responsibility for their actions and then blame subordinates for their own actions. This has cost Comcast dearly over the years. The hardest part of this job was dealing with management. It almost became a job to stay one step ahead of high school like behavior that was given this happened and both the Lynnwood, WA and the Everett, WA Call centers. The most enjoyable part was the customers even the difficult ones. I love people. What a lot of people don't realize is when a comcast employee has to tell the customer something like ""no you can't have credit for X"" it's because a manager has told us to tell you that. Then when the call gets escalated to management and the Manager acts like ""I don't know anything about this call"" thats deception.... Plain and simple..."
good,A typical workday involved assisting customers with bill payments and questions as well as mail sorting and processing.
good,Too many changes upon management and not enough employee appreciation.
good,"Face to Face customer contact. Great co-workers.You will develope tough skin. Not easy being the face of bad reviews. But when its good, its good."
good,I handled very disgruntled clients for Comcast on the Eastern Beltway of United States; I was very good with turning not so good conversations into pleasant ones. I was able to reassure clients that I was not the typical CSR and would be there for them to get issue resolved while on my call. The hardest part of the job was not being supported by Mgmt for issue resolve. Most enjoyable part was making a difference and turning unhappy situations into positive ones.
good,"A typical day at work is just like the day before, dealing with problems that have been pointed out but take painfully long to be addressed. Most adjustment done by the company come once a year. The company does try to do it's best and has shown that in my time there but promises in regards to upward mobility within the company have proven to be empty. Management is strictly top-down with very little feedback in regards to customers being taken into action by management, while they are (again) slow to adjust company practices that are not working well for employees. My co-workers are discouraged in their jobs and it breeds a culture of ""that's how it is,"" which I find unacceptable. This is also the hardest part of the job, wanting to be an agent of change but a lack of opportunity to move upward and a attitude of ""it's just one example"" by those you answer to makes contributing constructively the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was actually breaking through and seeing issues I raised and brought to management finally being adjusted and improving service to internal and external customers."
good,This position is a direct sales position dealing with customers in there
good,"I've worked for Comcast for more than 3 years now. I am currently searching for a new career, like many of the seasoned employees -who I might add have served Comcast for a minimum of 10 years plus!- are, simply because Comcast does not care about their employees anymore. Up until this last year, I truly enjoyed my job. Some bean counter way up the corporate ladder decided it was best (best only for the stockholders--- Not the employees or customers) to regionalize the entire company which has resulted in a massacre of peoples jobs. Now people, this is not just some growing pains.. This is pure greed. There is no help or support in any postion you fill. The lack of organization is shocking! !!! They have made it almost impossible to do your job. I cannot stress enough at how extremely disappointed I have recently become at Comcast as an employer. If you are considering longterm employment with Comcast, forget it! Terrible decision!"
good,It was a great company but it can also be very stressful with its strickness.
good,Dont know what the day holds for me. Log on to comcast sever for work for the day. I travel to each job ethier fixing or install home networking.
good,depending on want you want out of this experience here is what you'll get.
good,Building an effective multitasking focus will move you ahead much faster than anything else for this company. Being able to juggle multiple situations also increases your ability to magage relationships with management. The most difficult part is the constant changing of methodology and practices. The best part is finding and meeting new friends to continue your journey with.
good,"from my time there I learned alot. while there were many perks there were also downsides, like blatant favortism, miscommunication of salary and compensation, and long hours."
good,not a pleasant work experience towards the last 2 years. To much inconsistencies with senior management and to overall way the business was being ran.
good,"They give their employees Flex time and when it is used, they then reprimand the employee for using Flex time and consider it an ""unexcused"" absence. An employees performance is based on the bias of their manager. Comcast is not a good place to work. If you work in sales and don't make the assigned quota, you will be terminated. You can't send personal emails unless you are one of the ""chosen"" few that can get away with anything."
good,"Overall, Comcast is an average place to work, they pay their employees fairly and other compensation (health benefits, etc) are on par with other major companies."
good,"Challenge to maintain excitement when rules change weekly, when internet sales are better than direct sales offers, and you must fight for your sales. Peer support is a must to do well in this environment. The commissions are great but quotas are unreasonably high. You become only as good as yesterday’s sale."
good,In the beginning I felt quality was important for this company. Towards the end of my tenure it was clear to me that the profit became the priority over the technicians happiness in the work place.
good,Very inexperienced leaders.  My personal experience has been with the Finance department where leaders know more about spreadsheets than they do about leading a team and working with associates to help them grow and become better contributors and future leaders.
good,The company is good and I enjoyed what I did but not everyone is on the same page. One minute they're doing this and the next it's something else without a warning. when it comes to your customers you're limited to how you're able to help them
good,"taking multiple calls"
good,"Comcast could be a top tier company to work for. All they have to do is concentrate on the morale of the technicians. Animals are brought inside when the temperature is super cold. Yet, technicians have to work in it. Sad.."
good,The job was ok. The environment is a bit much to deal with. Even in management. The pay is ok not enough for our cost of living. You have to work a lot of overtime to make ends meet. Company has a lot of views that don't align with what should be a happy workplace.
good,"Comcast is a good place to work if you can keep your head down and ignore the hostile environment. Good benefits, fair salaries and opportunities for advancement are available."
good,Good training and benefits..technicians are put under tremendous pressure do to constant overbooking.often 10+hour days .Sunday to Wednesday shift particularly difficult to Sunday call offsa
good,"No real chance for advancement unless you're in bed with somebody. Management  just want to keep some people where they're at, benefits are outstanding however the pay sucks I've been here for over two years and barely making over $15 an hour. Not to mention how the customers are able to talk to you any kind of way but you're supposed to just sit there and take it like you're not a person."
good,Management changes its direction every so often.  You will need to be careful of how you interact with others.  If you can find an area that works best for you.  good luck
good,Employees overworked and treated poorly. Management treats employees as if they are imbeciles. Management pretends to care doing bi-monthly surveys on morale and company affairs. However any issues that are raised are ridiculed and belittled. I did not feel valued as an employee.
good,Only issue at comcast is the poor management skills. Managers and supervisors don't know how to talk to anyone and can be very verbally abusive and like to threaten your job was too much. It makes it very stressful and difficult to do your job properly or even to come in on your off day for overtime.
good,"There is no job security for the workers or management. Entire departments were let go several times in the short time of being there or you have to willing to move to an entirely different state...and even then job security isn't promised. Management needs interpersonal training classes, too much obvious favoritism there."
good,"Comcast put you through a lot of testing and training in a short amount of time and there were quotas you had to meet. If they weren't met the first 30 days you were wrote up and if it wasn't met the next month.... they let you go.  Turnover rate was high but if you were good with people, computers, multi line phone systems, and little supervision or assistance then it's a good spot."
good,"Benefits were outstanding, but the pay not so good. The job was stressful at times and management did not help. Buddy buddy system when it comes to promotions."
good,"Comcast is fumbling through new retail experience. If they address concerns, could improve immensely. Systems are overly complicated and have way too many steps to process simple tasks. Customers constantly complain about call center experiences."
good,"Love the job, but was lied to in the initial recruiting process about pay. Was promised a pay increase after training, never happened, nor any increases in a year."
good,"If you work in the CARE division it is misery, the employees are treated like another number. If you work in the business class or in the corporate offices its like working for a completely different company."
good,"They even have a program called ""Comcast Listens""...yeah don't think that actually works. Pay is decent but not where it should be for a company of this size. Management is lacking in training and tact. A manager once told a group of us ""you're already paid too much and you want more? Oops, I didn't mean 'too much' I meant 'a good salary'..."" "
good,"I have worked many years for the company and had a great friendship with my coworkers. The entry level jobs are very monotonous, Some supervisors do not have people skills for customers and employees."
good,Company dynamic made me feel like I was on an Island.  Compensation was above average.  Door to door sales with all of the professional tools need to approach customers from a corporate standpoint.
good,"Great environment , nervous job to work for ..it was stressful ....if you love talking and selling on the phone this is the job for you!  If you are active and don't like talking on phone and adventurous this not the job for you"
good,"N/A not very impressed with this company, compensation for top performers lacking management is weak with no training that actually applies to day to day expectations"
good,i was hired as a billing rep and was expected to sell. they are closed on sundays so my days off were not consecutive. they were wednesday and sunday.
good,Compensation was very poor for the workload that I had to endure. Management was not always on same page which in turn affected the work enviroment. Benefits were competitive.
good,"Retail stores are fast past and sales driven. Required to accurately handle cash payment and discuss bills. Issue equipment, resolve all customer concerns and escalation as well as sell all services."
good,"There goals are unrealistic with he volume of customers they have coming into the store. Most of the customers are coming in with problems,  questions, downgrades and return of equipment because they have spoken to a representative over the phone already. We would attempt to save them but some had already gone with another company because we weren't able to put them in another promotion"
good,In this job you will need strength having to deal with unhappy customer messed up bills and trying to upgrade accounts for customers whose current account is not
good,"Answering phone call and upselling "
good,Work day starts with getting yor workoders and going in route to the customer. Next is trouble shooting and fixing the customers problem. Hardest part is managing your time.
good,Work place is what you make it coworkers were great could have better compensation for employees for retirement if management new how to work with employees learn how to assist and not just use there position for what it is
good,No room for advancement in the mailroom. Same thing everyday and your input is not taken into account. Management marches to the beat of their own drum and doesn't take accountability for mistakes that are made.
good,"Comcast can be a brutal work environment for a tech"
good,"I worked for Comcast as a Tech for 2 years. The training was mostly good but you really get a feel for the job by working alongside your mentor and getting out on your own networking with your team and other techs. The job used to be a great career many years back when there wasn't an automated metrics and numbers game for your raises and promotions. That coupled with older, simpler cable to install. The cable of today is much more complex than it was 20-30 years ago, there are a lot of signal issues and services to install and troubleshoot and not enough time in the world to meet the ludicrous demands of Comcast. Here is an example, every job is worth a certain amount of production points. Each point is worth 5 minutes, a trouble call is worth 16 points. So about 1hr 20 minutes to solve the customers issue before you move on to the next job. Lets say this customers home has 5 outlets and all of the cable is an older standard and must be replaced, and they wanted more than the job was laid out for you to do, you are required to make it right for them, and often times it takes forever to get the job rebuilt, and structured so you can even install what they want and replace everything. This job ends up taking you most of the day, and so other jobs on your queue end up being allocated to some other techs already heavy workload and vice versa. This is just one inconvenience a tech faces often. The worst part is these kinds of setbacks really hurt your numbers and another bad part of the metrics game is called ""reworks"" where if you didn't solve the customers problems or educate"
good,It’s a good place to work. But pay is based on Another states cost of living.  So Living in Salt Lake City  and working for Comcast is not best if you’re trying to buy house or even live in the apartment because the cost-of-living is so high here living in Salt Lake City.
good,I really enjoy helping the many customers that come into the store. I have made a lot of friends. I have sold a lot of product line to many customers. I wish some of my co-workers and mgrs. had the same concerns for our customers.
good,"Totally mismanaged organization.  They launch a new product without fully vetting only to have the sales reps take the heat when it breaks down.  Metric goals are complicated; you can reach your sales goal and still be punished because the ""buckets"" aren't distributed correctly across categories. Managers have very little authority. Senior management has been off the street too long to give advice. Suggestion: let your best salespeople do what they do best. Don't tie them daily to a laptop inputting data that makes the company look good. "
good,great job if you love your work. being new is tough cause entry level your not as fast as other techs your not going to make as much and this will not get you farorite spots to be
good,"Someone with long term accounts can do very well."
good,"Really good pay. Much better than pretty much anyone else in town, assuming you can hit your sales goals. The hours are fixed, the management is fine, but they will fire you at the drop of a hat."
good,"Working as a home tech at Comcast is an experience in endurance, hard work and dedication. The Florence office would be better served to have an audit of those in management in Huntsville /Florence. My immediate supervisor, Josh, is a big advantage for the company, has the ability to communicate with the confidence of those of us out there in the field."
good,"Answered phones made sure customers stayed with us and didn’t want to cancels payments transfer calls make sure customer was okay once call ended"
good,"Overall the company is a great company to work for, IF you are able  to handle to people yelling and screaming. Work-life balance sucks, but if you work hard you may get promoted"
good,Great place to work at BNYMellon. I am very lucky to get selected in the interview and get a great platform to work . My team was very supportive and helpful.
good,I left the company because of my manager who was later fired for fraud. I would say 90% of the team has sense left after I was gone. The majority have reached out for recommendations.
good,Your not getting paid what you should and they are not on your back as they should so it kind of works out. I worked here for 6 years mainly because I was complacent.
good,"Working in a micromanaging department. Supervisors belittle employees, Given false promises of career advancement. There is no work life balance and management tell several lies."
good,Spend too much money on equipment and not enough on people. The environment is the easiest to work in but the staff is sometimes under skilled. If remote HR is almost invisible.
good,I've learned how to work with different people with different work attitude. Management should have a continuous quality improvement that would benefit both the employees and the company. It was a fun working environment as I have been with the company for almost 4 years.
good,"Call center atmosphere, everyday I had to prepare myself for verbal abuse from the customers and lack of empathy from management. Any complaint or concern was ignored or excused. Culture was outdated and high stress. Hardest part of my job was the constant customer abuse."
good,"Daily frustration and stressful situation. Does not mean that this is the overall company, just certain organization. Good Benefits. Questionable work life balance ratio."
good,Pay is considerable goog at the start but when they decided to take out tech incentives and add workload that was the beginning of their downfall. Hence the transfer
good,"Comcast changes up what is required of your position every month and you have to deal with a ton of unhappy customers all day long so even if you are their to ""sell"" you end up doing mostly customer service and taking the brunt of angry customers taking out their frustrations on you even though its the phone customer service or product failure that they are unhappy with"
good,A typical day at Comcast was taking calls all day and helping customers with their issues. I learned how to resolve customer issues in a timely fashion. The management was ok. It seemed as though they weren't really involved with the representatives too much. The workplace culture was fun. The people I worked with were great. The hardest part of the job was taking calls from irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction on resolving customer issues.
good,"Although sometimes it could be pretty laid back, this place can filled with a lot of tension. Trying to make your quota for the month. Calling customers and trying to get them to spend more money before they end up spending even more money. We did have a lot of incentives to do better, but this job can be very stressful."
good,"I worked overnights and only seen my manager 3 times in a year and a half. I had 2 one on one meeting with my manager. I learned some stuff from my peers. Hardest part of the job was not getting updates for changes so my team could do the job better. Come into the office,  greet my employees. While they take technical calls, I look at my calendar and read and respond to emails. Have NPS Huddle. Most enjoyable part of my day is working with my team to ensure their metrics are Achieves Expectations or higher. Work culture- if you dont like your job leave, that makes a person's morale low. Instead of finding out why the employees are unhappy."
good,"Short term the company may be alright. You will see many other employees come and go. Management has their own agenda, a typical day consists of anywhere between 10 and 60 calls. ranging from several minutes to 45 minutes in length depending on the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is your fellow employees, hardest part is dealing with low wages for the lack of overall assistance you receive from upper management and the lack of reliability in the tools and programs used on a day to day basis."
good,"High turn-over rate due to stress level at work, little chance for advancement. Company even offers access to psychiatrist due to job causing several mental health issues."
good,This position was constantly changing but the management team were never on the same page. Constantly adjusting the expectations but supervisors never held people to the same standard. Pay was poor for the amount of work that was expected of us. Benefits are great but they don't really make up for working for a company that so many people despise.
good,"The income was great, but the stress was terrible.  Management kept raising the target sales matrix making it harder and harder for many of us to reach for full commission each month."
good,Any part-timers are paid very low and as i understand full-timers aren't too much better compensated.  My most reent manager took another job and the new one seems to bring more of a negative attitude to the job.  Looking to relocate soon; half because of personal advancement and half because of location
good,"Paid a lot of money, but did not allow for personal growth and mental development. Work place is demanding due to customers and the image Comcast is trying to develop. Changes are constantly happening, week to week. Management is not present at all, constant meetings and reviews that take away from learning and growth."
good,"Workplace culture clustered, not very productive work place, little or no privacy.  Contractors hours closely maintained, work closely scrutinized.  Inadequate training and no written procedures."
good,"Worked here for 2 years, get a slight raise but basically decrease in commission. Good commission system and alright hourly pay. Supervisor I had never could not help, any question asked he route me to a co worker. He never took sup calls and never waived a sick day, even though I brought in doctors notes. The point system is terrible. You don't get .25 for missing 1 or 2 hours of your shift you get a full .50 or even 1 full point after 4 so you might as well not come in, that's not motivating. I know a few people getting fired over fmla because the doctor could not fill out the forms right but instead of understanding that it wasn't the employees fault they just fire them."
good,"working in retention , managers didn't want to help their team with difficult customers or some kind of discount to the clients. We weren't allowed to stand up, we had to sit at our desk all day."
good,I started Comcast fresh out of high school. It was definitely a good job being young but i wasn't getting paid what i should and the security of keeping the job was slim. What i loved most about this job was working in the field and with different customers everyday.
good,"You have to kiss butt if you want to move up. Not what I do. Other employees had no problem. If you are a favorite, you will get far. If you are not, you will get left behind."
good,Comcast can be a great company if yo find the right role within the company. Most outside sales people are not valued. We are expendable and it's made known throughout the organization.
good,"I worked in door to door sales.  Was a great job till we got a new Director.  He favored woman, the attractive ones of course, and never wanted to hear any opinion but his own.  When you questioned him, he became angry at you and hateful.  They have promoted him.  lol"
good,Would still be working there if I wasn't laid off. Liked my time there.Wages are okay but not great.Overall Comcast is a decent company to work for.Its a company you can make a career with.
good,"they offer very good benefits, they make you stay on your toes all the time, my department's supervisor wasn't very knowledgeable preventing him from training very well"
good,"Comcast is a wonderful organization, great for people looking to grow their careers and add that ""Fortune 100"" item to their resume and profile. However, few people stay long term at HQ because of the lack of leadership and the mismanagement of projects. It's a ""hurry up and go"" culture where there's little thoughtful planning to strategic project management or the balance required to manage a never ending litany of projects. It's de-centralized structure allows each of the 3 geographical divisions to exert their own influence and dictate the shape and deployment of programs. It's a top-down place where the biggest influencer wins and few senior leaders listen."
good,"the pay with this employer is great, however, the company needs to evaluate management. Everyone has their own agendas and no one is willing to collaborate or work with the agents or customers. This company also wants you to push people to buy things/add things to their bills when most call in with billing concerns about not being able to afford their services"
good,Hires H-1Bs and contractors instead of permanent employees for about 90% of IT related work. Very difficult to be converted from a contractor to a fill time employee.
good,Comcast works their employees to death.  There is never any funding to add headcount but as the company expands the workload increases.  Work/Life Balance is non-existent.
good,The job consist of a daily complaint from customers as well as lack of pay for work required. A constant lack of support from management and very little career advancement. Job in summary pays the bills but is only that a job not a career
good,"Most employees nice to work with but management lacked authority.  Did not enforce company policy with all, only some.  Pay and and benefits nice.  Lacked training from all aspects of the jobs in office."
good,"Work culture is nice and relaxed and usually its not more than 4-5 hours a day. In terms of learning, there are lot things to learn about the internet and Comcast is the right place."
good,"Long days but loved helping customers, vans where not that great but made it work. Equipment could have been alot better. Never hated going in to work"
good,"If you just do your job, as trained, you would become a top technician. When I worked here there was a constant problem of being overbooked for appointments."
good,"Comcast offers 80 hours for vacation, great benefits, and a secure place to work, but the customers abuse and pay do not match. Customers are absolutely awful to the employees and the stress levels are through the roof. People are interviewed for internal jobs even though they already want to hire someone specific, but call the interview process ""fair"", which clearly it is not. Not a place I'd recommend unless you are deceptive and very cut-throat competitive."
good,The Tech Ops department does not have a good work life balance. Leadership roles are on salary and you can work easily 50 plus hours a week. Being in management does not make you a good leader. I would say that this is strictly Tech Ops. Other departments may not be like this.
good,The Company as a whole has a been very successful. They have many talented individuals but management does a very poor job of managing the associates. Although compensation is very competitive the poor benefits bring that amount down considerably.
good,"poor management. Poor wrk life balcne. poor training. This is a place to not work here, reason for leaving, illness brought on  by work . poor support from"
good,If you like to be yelled out for 8 hours a day this is the perfect job for you.  It was very stressful and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I did love my co-workers but that is the only thing.
good,Comcast is a good company to work for.  I have worked here for 9.5 years and the benefits are very good.  My family and I have been impressed with the medical and dental benefits.
good,Fast paced environment if you cannot mulit task this is not a job for you.  Heavily weigh metrics alot of pressure to meet numbers and sell benefits are great
good,"decent place to work - well paid and good benefits I would say are the best part of working at Comcast.  Hours are long, lots of micro management here, it is not  a FUN place to work."
good,I started with the company opening a new store. The employees that were apart of the opening were very difficult to work with. The management was change within a few months after I started. I applied for the store manager position but was never given a reason why I was not given the position. I continued to work as if I was the store manager but was given no continued direction.
good,"very stressful fast past work with a lot of micromanaging and working on off time"
good,"I do not know what it is to work for Comcast in-house, but as a temp we are constantly reminded that we are expendable.  When there is a job opening we are qualified to take based off of knowing Comcast's work flow or in some instances actually already know how to do the given job, we are still interviewed and forced to compete with outside sources."
good,"80-100 calls from customers inquiring about their cable bill, tech calls, sales calls, and ppl either wanting to disconnect their services or add/remove items from or to their account"
good,The only good part of the job was the training period. When you got put on the floor it seemed like you were on your own. There was not enough people to help you with situations when you needed it.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with technicians to solve customer issues. Very little work life balance because I work a minimum of 55 hours a week. Hardest part of the job is my schedule.  I work Sunday through Thursday which impacts my ability to be involved with my child's sports activities.
good,"Comcast is just one of those places. Very top down, with all decision making removed from local management. Very difficult to advance your salary, and salary already not comparable to similar jobs at other local companies. "
good,Comcast is a good job with a great work environment. It is also a very stressful job but help is always available and the employees are the best part of working there.
good,A typical day at work was calls taken with 3 different product that either could be fixed over the phone or making appointments to have a technician come fix an issue. I continued to practice being a self-starter and how to manage myself independently. The workplace culture was ever shifting and changing all the time which is typical of call center environments. the hardest part of the job was the required amount of sales that one was to successfully complete from a repair call. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the people.
good,Management team is not the best. I witnessed very tenured people resign due to poor management. The care centers are like poorly ran schools. Management needs to be stronger.
good,Comcast is great place to work if you can deal with the stress and allow management to over step their authority . You have to not challenging health issue or that will cause a lost of employment
good,Truly enjoyed working with fellow veterans at Comcast.  I've made several new friends/colleagues through this network who I will remain in contact with.
good,It is a fairly new department and constantly  growing. I have learned a lot working here and hopefully will be able to grow within the company. It is a great place for a young person just starting out.
good,"Comcast can be a great company to work for... depending on the department that you are in, especially in the call centers. Video repair (my department), is by far the worst department in the entire company. Majority of the supervisors WILL NOT offer competent support, and new policies are added in order to make our jobs harder than they already are."
good,Comcast is a decent place to work. There is a lot of general training offered and co-workers are willing and want to work together. It really depends upon who your manager is.
good,"Constantly playing a numbers game to meet your metrics.You will be very over worked and not given proper assessments. the goals they want you to meet are not possible and they keep getting harder each year.  The company does have great benefits such as reduced cable accounts and 401k and stock options, but that is the Company. The Boca office that I worked out of only cares about how much you can get done in the least amount of time. It used to be a great place to work but over the years management was concerned with quantity not quality, they make you feel that they are not getting their monies worth out of you."
good,The typical workday is fast paced and high stress. The company has constant change and you're constantly learning as well.............................
good,"just a regular day,management was dysfunctional, no work and life balance, the hardest part of the job is the customers, joel is trash, it was just a huge bum, great compensation"
good,It's has good job advancement but it doesn't meet the needs of a mother or home life. Pay base is good if you are coming in with no experience bonuses are fair. Management is more work not a team feel.
good,"liked the job, however lots of lies. not a lot of room for advancement. the management says one thing and does another. calls and commission is very inconsistent"
good,"The job is demanding and can be draining. It is sales and people can be upset. Management has a lot of their plate so you relay heavily on the rest of your team for help and support. They do pay you for your time well,but there aren't constant hours. You will stay busy and if you can sell, there is a lot of money to be made."
good,"There was no clear direction within management...In my department training was NOT clear and precise, no manual, no on-boarding for new employees.  In my previous jobs, there was always upward mobility and mentors.  In this job, you had to basically train yourself and figure things out.  Overall, these things made me more resilient and resourceful."
good,Too many sales quota requirements for the billing department. CAE's endure a lot of verbal abuse from customers. Cursed out or worst on a daily basis. Job became very stressful. Every time a seen a Comcast sign would get extremely bad tension headaches. Glad they changed to Xfinity.
good,there is no balance your better off at AT&T or pray and hope you get placed with a great team and manager thats what makes the big difference for this job
good,"a typical day was very relaxed atmosphere."
good,Assist customers with their account. Review bill with customer. Provide information about products and services. Build rapport with customers. Pitch sales to new and current customers.
good,"This use to be a great place to work, the pressure has increased and the work life balance no longer exist. The managers are so overworked and constantly traveling and having meetings about getting more sales. Nothing is upheld as far as customer service, if you spend your time helping customers you will lose your job for not getting enough sales."
good,they have good benefits and discounts. but working there is none stop! work OT almost every day. they care more about good surveys from techs and dont focus on fixing their customer service at the call centers where the real issues are at.
good,"Very competitive in nature. Daily conversations with supervisors to ensure that everyone is on track. Also, progression and promotion are seldom and very political."
good,They think that your life revolves around them and every year around Christmas holidays they tend to cut long term employees to bring in cheaper salaries. They have good benefits but don't expect to stay long.
good,I am not really abig salespersoe job done but to get the job done I learned how had o be a salesperson and love being around people and had great teammates
good,"I worked there for over a year but I could see that the culture there was who you know and how well you knew them in order to advance.  Benefits were awesome, work pace was HIGH paced (not a bad thing) you can not go wrong with this place"
good,Comcast is  a great company but can be very stressful at times and hard to balance life and work sometimes they have really great benefits and great incentives
good,Mix feelings about this job will say it is a great place to work if your not in a call center or service tech. very high stress work environment but there is alot of room for advancement
good,job culture isn't the best....primarily focused on money and not work life balance.  Customer service is terrible which kills your sales...hours are fine
good,"Job was a lot of fun and challenging at times, Managers did not do a good job of potraying expectations and micromanaged. People were great to work with."
good,its a nice paying job but the managers are no good. the commission is very good but they have a 30 day policy. if the customers don't keep the service u lose the commission.
good,"Attempting to look for another job due to stress. Working around safety hazards looking to identify and work around to prevent injury. Pleasing customers and instructing how to use installed equipment. How to install Comcast equipment including digital settop TV boxes. Modems for phone and internet including wifi, how to work with customer equipment. How to install wireless adapters for computers. Backfeed phone systems. Dealing with unreasonable customers."
good,"I was promoted after two years and was considered a top performer throughout my tenure.  It is a hard-working culture.  I enjoyed most of my time there.  "
good,I was in charge of a selling in certain areas called turf in Seattle.  I was to seek out new customers and also to contact people who were not current customers to attempt to bringing them back into the fold. I was also assigned to contact customers who for whatever reason had left Comcast find out why they had left and sell the benefits of our product line over our competitors.   Customer retention was also a part of the job with existing customers upgrading them to our new product lines show casing the value of bundling to bring them the most value for their dollar.
good,"Start work 8am to 7pm"
good,I enjoyed the job and my work environment.  If management has changed then its a good company to work for. No further information to provide.
good,"Typical work day is from 8-5. Everyday is a new and different day. Each day has its own challenges, which is good. No day is the same as the previous day. There is always something new to learn each day. Management  doesn't engage too much at all with subordinate employees.  They are very detached from the every day personnel."
good,Not a fan of being micromanaged; nor am I a fan of constant shift bids. Comcast offers great benefits and pay and like to promote from within but would not recommend for parents of small children or students.
good,"Great company with good benefits. "
good,"No matter the job title, at Comcast sales are always a priority to management. I worked in technical support and was still required to upsell customers even when they were irate about their current services not working. The attempted sales pitch almost always made the customers even angrier, which contributed to an already stressful work environment."
good,"Emails and examining alarms coming in, call the Vendors and troubleshooting. Reaching out to upper management to help assist with the troubleshooting."
good,"The hardest part of the job is securing your sales without others stealing your orders."
good,"wiring installing cable boxes internet phone service  "
good,"Having worked at Comcast for 9.5 years now, I can say there has been one constant.  That's the target is always moving. It doesn't matter what subject, or metric, it's always changing making it difficult for employees to rise in the ranks.  The supervisors have no real power, they are just puppets to the VPs who are in turn puppets to the divisional level people who have no genuine real world field experience."
good,Very stressful work environment they are a good company with great benefits however the call wait agitates the customers and they take it out on you.
good,Very fast paced environment you get to meet a lot of new people on a daily basis. Learned a lot I appreciated that more than anything else.
good,Extremely high turn over.  Leadership turned over like crazy during my time with the company.  I had two different extended periods without a supervisor.
good,Some of management has poor communication skills leading to disgruntled employees who don't trust their leadership.  Little to know employee development.  Very little recognition.
good,Moving up in seniority or getting promoted is extremely difficult. Or changing departments. Management will promote friends before they promote on merit.
good,Typical day at work was sitting at a desk for 7 hours answering incoming calls about customers bills. The job can be very demanding but you have to stay positive. Treat every call different and meet company standards the best you can.
good,"very competitive company to work for! lots of running around and climbing ladders to complete installs, management needs to be re-evaluated"
good,"job has changed to the point you are not in control of your own job security its in the hands of customers, you come in at 06:45 and get off whenever.Pay checks never right"
good,Change was a daily issue which effected the productivity of the sales team. I always hit goal however it was a very stressful way to work daily.
good,"The benefits and pay were the only things that are keeping me here. The culture died when the CEO's father did. The management is awful, it's moving toward a more retail environment and they will chew you up and spit you out at the drop of a hat, no loyalty to top sales performers. Look for any position outside of the Xfinity Store and you'll be happier for it. Trust me."
good,tv stations are hard to review. not always the greatest working environment because there are very few jobs available and management knows that
good,Comcast started out as a great and fun job but the longer I was there the more it started to change I was there for 10+ years we were always reminded about the company being a AT WILL job things changed all the time and with any job you expect change but not like Comcast your position could be cancel at any given time there is no job security everyone work by their own rules and your commission is taken in the blink of a eye for any given reason for Comcast to be such a huge company it is poorly run I think the big people need to see what the little people actually do in their day to day job and pay the for the hard work they do I always felt we were under paid I'm not here to just bash the company because I loved my time at Comcast and they did everything within their reach to keep me as a employee I just couldn't stay for other reasons not company related so I will say I will keep all my Comcast services that is tv/internet/phone/and home alarm  FYI. employee dont want all the hats and shirts give more money
good,Very hectic company who is transitioning their leadership platform from a regional one to a national one with many opportunities. Little attention is paid to the cultural effects on all the departments.
good,Best part of the job was providing service to customers that waited for extended periods of time due to right of way issues.
good,"You can make a lot of money if that is your goal in this particular job.  Goals are reasonable, however, management continues to change the compensation plan not in the sales representatives favor.  First line development managers are awesome, beyond that, watch out.  Very difficult to move forward in this company from direct sales."
good,"It is a great company to work for. We get free services and the health benefits are good. A typical day is taking calls from customers who are having issues with services and helping them repair them or find a resolution. We take about 30-50 calls a day from people who are kind, or extremely upset to the point of yelling and swearing not just about the service, but at us. This is the hardest part of the job. My fellow agents are amazing and I have made some great friends at work. However, upper management needs an overhaul. If you get on one person's bad side, there is no upward movement possible. While it is a great company to work for, I need something with a more flexible schedule and good compensation."
good,Really good at working around school schedule for college students. Infrequent opportunities for advancement and growth. Very friendly staff.
good,Handled everything from retention/billing to technical needs of business customers with add's moved changes and trouble shooting of complex issues.
good,Management and workload/balance is very unorganized. Income is variable at best. Good for learning experience and entry level training.
good,"Comcast was a good company to work for, however they are too large of a company. Employees are only numbers.It is hard to move forward in the company, unless you know the right people. Individual supervisors are good, but have limited control and authority. It is nice to not work in an office and be able to home garage the company vehicle. I like working with tools."
good,"When I started this job, the promises were amazing. Absolutely great compensation plans and great hourly wage. The training program really made me feel like I was part of a great and growing company. I was proud to sell their product, and I was itching to get in the field. "
good,I learned that I am to be patient and understanding that all customers are not open for change but to remain humble and positive.
good,Everything is performance based on unattainable goals.  We get hourly pay but r expected to meet expectations that are too high.
good,"handling customers payments,sales of new service and upgrading existing services,trouble shooting cable and internet problems,handling customer escalations"
good,There is too many changes in this company. Upper management cares more about the number than the problems that is going on.
good,would come in clock in and begin taking calls and taking calls about customers bills and services. Scheduling technicians and trouble shooting. Only part was office politics you must know someone or brown nose in order to move up does not matter if you have written letters of customers and surveys that I am a great representative they dealt with. It is hard to move around in the company
good,Selling and promoting Comcast Cable products services to residential customer have a 6 weeks training program . Every Account Executive has there own territory
good,"The company provides nice incentives for the employees. "
good,"I would have to say that out of the many places that Ive worked Comcast  totally  has more perks then any other place.  I feel that the pay should be more for what the reps have to go through. "
good,"At comcast I was able to be promoted from communication tech 1 to communication tech 4 qualified. I have 7 years of supervisory role and training of new tech's and oversaw day-to-day operations including inventory management, sales reporting. I was able to helped increased customer satisfaction, retention of current customers and Installed Comcast product and equipment while fixing any issues the customers may have had with comcast services."
good,Working for Comcast has both positives and negatives. The work week if offset from the traditional. The hours are steady and don't change but you work either very early in the morning or very late at night sunday to thursday or tuesday to saturday.
good,"Provide friendly and knowledgeable service to the customers. Provide information for call-in customers and potential customers. Sold internet, phone, and cable."
good,"I worked at Comcast in customer service.  I worked face to face.  This job was very stressful and I was very unhappy.  The pay before sales commission is not worth what you go through with the customers and changes in management.  If you start working in the service centers or call centers good luck advancing out.  The company is very political (all about who you know) and most people are in those jobs for years to come.  I saw no way out so I left on my own.  The company does have great benefits and incentives and pay when you sell well.  If you're trying to get your foot in the door don't get through DSR, Xfinity Store Rep, or Call Center Rep, you'll see years of your life pass by with no advancement."
good,"The job was relatively easy and co- workers were cool, but some of the supervisors were a bit pushy trying to get you to make sales. You have to keep up a certain number of sales to keep your job and heaven help if you get sick because you have to call out every, single. day that you're going to be out of work.  It's very easy to rack up occurrences, and too many of those get you terminated. Pay is not that great and you have to make a crapload of sales in order for it to even make  scratch on your bi-weekly paycheck. As I said before, if you don't mind working for commission and doing part time hours, this job is exactly what you need, just don't make it your one and only job."
good,This company offers great benefits and paid time off to all employees.  Part timers get almost all the same benefits as full time employees.
good,Good opportunity to learn management skills. Pride in helping people. Hardest part of the job is to stay within suggested call times. Best part is solving an issue for the customer.
good,"Maintaining merchandise is available in stock"
good,Inbound Sales. Daily I would take incoming calls for Customers to set up new services. I would also help customers with their billing or service issues.
good,"Job was stressful due to the ridiculous transformation from one region to another. A typical day I would constantly take verbal abuse from callers, complaining about their services and typically and couldn't get any one out to resolve the problem in a fair amount of time. People were constantly upset about their services and what they paid monthly."
good,"The management works hard to ensure the ambiance and work environment is positive.  Colleagues are supportive.  Teamwork is highly encouraged.  Food and refreshment is abundant.  You learn quite a bit each day, both from your co-workers, your supervisors, and customers alike.  All departments have a sales quota.  They don't tell you that until after you are hired.  You are required to sell every transaction.  If you find yourself to be proficient, you will discover you were hired for your personality, not your ability to perform the job.  If you are hourly, you have to use portions of your allotted break times to use the bathroom or go get a drink of water.  You are given a very small box to work inside of, but you are encouraged to use its small area to the fullest.  Innovation to processes is discouraged, and you may be disciplined for it.  Going out of your box to help the customer is discouraged, and you may be disciplined for it.  Self-sufficiency is discouraged, and you may be disciplined for it.  Your personal account information and billing is available, documented, and reviewed by your supervisor.  If you are tired of working for companies with a negative working environment, you may find some solace and relief here.  Some people find the positivity an overwhelming reason to stick around, though there is a high turnover."
good,"Benefits are great they have more refrigerators than I could count in the break room.The vending machines were the best you could ask for they have drinks in them and juice and sandwich's and muffins and breakfast stuff of course it was way over priced but hey gotta make a buck some where right. They have mini coffee machines with free tea and microwaves and sinks at the end of almost every hall.Very large bathrooms with super stalls they don't auto flush but hey they do have auto sinks and auto paper towels.They also have a mini gym and big yoga balls about 2 of those assorted weights and tread mills and bikes. Wall mounted tv's just about everywhere hey it's Comcast of course they have tv and wifi everywhere. I forgot to mention with all the work your gonna do they also have a barista there a Tully's with the nicest people running that place they will fix anything for you to keep you awake and energized cause believe me your gonna need the speed for this place. When you go out on the floor after they pack your brain with so much information and expect you to perform up to the numbers you either make it or your told ""are you sure this is the right fit for you?"" if you hear this your doomed. No longer will you sit in those nice comfortable chairs in front of those big spacious desk with all the free toys they throw at you from training all lined up all over your desk all the while your being cussed out by customers who are so unhappy with their service or product all the while your doodling on your Comcast paper they gave you till they calm down enough so you can speak and hopefully"
good,the pay is low and the opportunity to move up is slim to none. i wouldn't go back this was the worst job ever.
good,"houston, texas."
good,"Typical day as a tech, your given 30 min to get to 1st job that is about 45 min away then your not going to get a lunch break without a fight. If you have concerns our need help, management just ignores you and treats you as less than human. The Co-Workers are great we are all treated poorly so we try to stick together."
good,"Comcast is a beautiful business and is huge, Because of how big they are, the company seems to not care about a lot of what they should. Such as their customers and employees. I just did not feel appreciated."
good,High stress face to face customer service coupled with high sales goals and long hours.
good,"It's a pretty nice place to work. People were nice there and it was a pretty well paying job. I learned to compromise with customers and try to find out what they needed and what they didn't  want. I also learned more computer skills. For example, my computer typing speed is faster and I also am better at multi-tasking. The hardest part about this job is trying to understand what the customer is wanting sometimes. Customers can be a little mean at times when they don't get what they want, but I try my best to try and have them satisfied by the end of the call. Dealing with the co-workers is easy. Everyone helps out when help is needed. No one jus sits around and not help. I can that's the best thing about this job is because it is so friendly."
good,The company overall is a good place to work if you are able to find a group that fits your work style. Especially if you are based out of headquarters.
good,there have been many changes within this company and many are not welcomed by employees.  This position can be stressful at times and I do like my co workers.  I have been in this position for a while and I am now searching for something more challenging.  My co workers are the most enjoyable part of my job.  I have learned a lot about the cable industry since my hire.
good,"Typical high pressure sales center"
good,I truly enjoyed the customer / employee relationships that were built with the clients and the various areas that were available
good,Working at Comcast is stressful it is a good paying company but lacks respect for employees.
good,Hard to keep up with the price changes and promotion changes.
good,"My day consisted of setting priorities for my staff, managing the flow of inventory and servicing our customers.  Being in management one has to expect that a typical day can change at the blink of an eye.  I enjoyed the everyday challenges that came along with my job.  What I did learn was how to mange those challenges across multiple locations.  I enjoyed coaching and working with my team to make them better as well as myself.  The hardest part was the lack of communication between myself and my counterparts."
good,"Large company, in virtually every state of US. Competitive pay. The name looks great on your resume."
good,"Very unorganized, lack of leadership, employee talent and skills are underutilized, constant restructures that are unproductive and take steps backwards"
good,"Most calls are from customers screaming about an issue caused by the company, company policies are ever changing and usually contradictory causing further stress. Tried to enforce a strict timed customer service regime while most of the issues on customers accounts would take more time than allowed to fix due to system errors and internal problems/processes."
good,Highly polticized. Good ole boys network. Discriminatory of people with a better career profile or newer to the cable industry.
good,This was part-time was working full-time at Fort Sanders at the same time. My day was to upgrade Comcast customers or try to do a buy-back when they have switched to another cable provider. What I learn that cable has came a long way since it first began. The management was fair but I needed something that offered benefits and my full-time job had that. The hardest part of the job was getting our old customers back.
good,A typical work day would be mentally preparing myself to get ready for my day. Then I would gather all of my items that I would need for the day and then head out. The hardest part of my job was working in the cold. I really loved the freedom of my job.
good,Results oriented company where culture changes constantly becasue of the mnany aquisitions the company is involved in.
good,"When I first applied to this job, our district manager had assured me there would be adequate amounts of time between work and home life, and that he would be willing to work around my schedule to allow me time to be involved in certain certain activities outside of work.  When I started my job, I very quickly learned how wrong that statement was.  I have a market manager who will not allow for those open times to be involved in activities outside of work.  On top of that, she is very pushy with her sales goals.  She will set high goals that seem not achievable, and even if you come close to hitting that goal, in her eyes, it's ""unacceptable.""  I also don't like how they have changed around the commission payouts.  When I began here, the quota, and the payout was pretty evenly matched, and although it was hard to make it happen, it was still very possible.  Now, they have a quota that is much higher, the point payout for commission is set much lower, making the ability to actually receive a commission check each month much more of a challenge.  I do not have any direct Comcast employees that work with me, but I do have a wonderful Best Buy crew I work with.  The hardest part about this job is meeting the daily quota demands as well as keeping a sale once you make it.  People tend to jump ship quickly because of how poor our customer service department is."
good,"Overall, the company seems good to work for in terms of their values, being family oriented, and producing quality products. I personally found it a little difficult to advance in this company, and they don't seem to really push advanced education and overall professional development. Those would be the cons of the company. The people that I worked with, the other benefits, and the courtesy Comcast service were all pros to the job."
good,little room for advancement. under staffed. little training. learn most of job  y trial and error.
good,Took calls from customers with concerns re their bills.  Some of these customers could be quite the challenge to appease.
good,"a typical day at work is making sure all orders are completed for contractors, spokes, payment centers."
good,"Managers do not follow up on their work. Goals are set to high to actually be met. overall good pay worked here 6 month s and made 12,000.00"
good,Very busy call center with lots of guidelines and structure
good,This company provided holiday lunches and a lot of spiffs. There were a lot of fun competitions between the different departments.
good,"My day starts with the usual project meeting where we identify and set project priorities."
good,"Great company, steady work flow, strong network, huge opportunity to network and build up your contacts."
good,"Comcast has great perks and benefits, but the company has a high turnover rate."
good,Typical workday very easy going learned new work techniques very offten great coworkers made each day exiting from start to finish.
good,a typical day at work would be contacting different departments with in the company lots of inbound calls from customers management was always helpful. The hardest part would be trying to complete everything in one day. the most enjoyable part of the job would be achieving your goals and promotions.
good,"In a typical day, I would arrive at the office in the morning for team meetings, calling leads, and appointment setting.  I would also use my mornings to settle any outstanding issues with customer accounts, often having to work with other departments to coordinate such remedies (repair, plant upgrade, theft of service campaigns, billing issues, contract questions and disputes).  After completing all of my office activities I would then head to the field to start field work and field visits for the day.  I visited the offices of property managers, building owners, leasing agents and meeting of condo association boards to promote, sell and manage Comcast Cable at these properties."
good,Benefits are good but management is very out of touch. Good performance is barely considered when up for advancement.
good,"Always outages, never have floor support take about 60 to 100 calls daily"
good,Very self-dependent work environment must be a go getter. I learned all aspects of the industry there.
good,"A day at the job would consist of coming right in and logging into the computer and phone systems and start answering calls. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help the customer with any issues they were having whether it was something going wrong with their cable, internet, or bill."
good,Work with Sports Anchors and Producers to produce daily sports shows. Learned how to edit on different platforms. Linear and Non-Linear editing systems. Management is never around if you have a concern or question. Hardest part of the job is working with Associate Producers who are not trained. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching sports and getting paid for it.
good,"Good place to work if you know the right people. The tech Managers are fair for the most part, and the warehouse has to back up as far as supervisors go. The people are good and it's awesome place to be if your not working in the warehouse."
good,"I have worked at Comcast for seven years. A typical work day begins with checking my vans inventory and logging on to a symbol device to receive my first two or three jobs. As a C.T.4 my primary jobs are residential alarm installs and service calls as well as commercial phone,internet,and video installs and service calls. ."
good,advancing in this company is who you know and not what you know if you are liked then you get advanced
good,"Its a fun place to work with some great compensation. However, communication and knowledge of policy is AWFUL from the management."
good,i believe the management could be better organized and have a better way of executing its form of planned duties.
good,Typical day at work would be to log on 2 computer and phone system because everything worked hand-in-hand. One of the most challenging part of my job was making sure field employees complied with leaving the office on-time to start their field route. Family oriented type of atmosphere and the hardest part is when customer are not receiving top notch service. Most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer is truly and fully satisfied.
good,Answering customer calls and solving repair issues with video as well as dealing with any sales or billing concerns. I learned the different techniques to resolve issues within the media environment as well as how to deal with irate customers with patience and understanding. Management was very open to ideas to improve the support functions within the call center. My co-workers each contributed to my individual style of customer service skills and were very dedicated to making sure no one failed with monthly performance goals. The hardest part of my job was learning the many aspects to resolving the customer's issues as well as the correct contacts within the company to get the issue resolved in a timely manner. I really enjoyed my job when I was able to resolve the customer's issues with service or billing and able to hear the appreciative tone in their thanks.
good,Work environment not always professional change policies alot after they have fired serval employees for not following those policies.
good,A typical day at work consists of answering questions from Comcast customer regarding their equipment or billing concerns. This fast-paced environment included over 100 calls a day with set standards and goals for each call. Co-workers are very diverse and friendly.
good,"A great job fr a single person with no kids. U don't get to pick hours , so for single parents with young children , U could end up working 3:30 to 12 midnight and no there not willing to work wit U. U don't learn what hours your going to be given until the first day of training."
good,Everything is not as it seems.. can be extremely stressful.
good,A typical day at work would involve assessing potential client/customers needs for our services and then closing and implementing the services.
good,The best part of the job is working as a team so no one gets left behind.
good,Placed outgoing calls to customers regarding their services.
good,"The Comcast work family lacks to strive to give its employees many things, compensation, appreciation, recognition and motivation. They have only succeeded on one thing, churn. The reason their churn is so high is because there is no reason to want to work for them. Give an employee motivation and compensation and you will be surprised on what can be achieved."
good,I have nothing to say about it. I would say that it was a pretty good company to work for though.
good,* Handle about every call accordingly
good,processing returned checks/bankruptcy/equipment returns/maintained several spreadsheets/
good,"Customer service in a call center environment. I learned techniques in dealing with irate customers. Management was ethnically mixed, which was good sometimes. Loved my co-workers, they were why I came to work. Minimal breaks."
good,The company practices have change over the years. They no longer care to keep employees for long periods of time. The company will move all the jobs from one geographical area to another once the employees have reach the median salaries and benefits to avoid paying for said benefits. Comcast will hire young individual that will not stay for very long.
good,Be at work at 7am to get our routes of about ten jobs for the day as well as equipment needed for that day i worked with about thirty of the greatest guys to work with i learned how to wire coax cable as well as phone lines inside peoples homes as well as some custom work (wallfishs) and such the reason i left was because of management. I was working 80 hrs a week and when i needed off for personal time it was a problem wifes car broke down or grandmother in hospice etc. Best part of the job was freedom while driving from job to job no one breathing down neck all the time and the hardest thing was climbing telephone poles about 30ft in the air with strong winds
good,A normal day of taking approx 60 calls assisting customers with account inquiries and trouble issues with their cable service. the most unlike part of the job is the pay for the mass of work I perform.
good,"We get our route for that day at the sametime we go get the DVR boxes that we have to put in to the customers homes.I had co workers but I would only see them on my way to a house or coming in for the day to return the trucks,other than that you was by yourself in the truck.The hardest part of the job was the pay."
good,"My job consist troubleshooting customers cable, phone, and internet equipment. Also I established new accounts."
good,the most difficult part of this job is dealing with management who only sees whats on paper. they werent concerned with any type of problem until it became a headache for them directly.
good,It was a good company to work for. The customers help PUSH you to find a solution.
good,Solid business model in a very challenging business environment. But people are essentially commodities
good,"Very busy, Not secure!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of processing paperwork. I got a chance to learn how different parts of the company work. Some parts of the company had great management, while local management struggled to maintain good employee morale. The hardest part of the job, is not knowing if it will be the day that you will be laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co workers."
good,Opportunities for advancement are limited. Sales supervisors have conflicting goals to the sales executives they manage. Productivity goals clash with compensation goals making it difficult to perform to expectations.
good,basically it was a very monotonous job no real excitement just receiving inbound calls taking customer orders. I really improved my data entry skills and talking to the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Co-workers work as a team which gives a sense of accomplishment.
good,Made follow up phone calls in the am then did cold calling most of the afternoon and evening. Set up appts and talked with several people each day. Sometimes the weather made it tuff to walk door to door but most people were a pleasure to talk with and almost always wanted to hear what we had to offer them.
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for, they help in educating you with 100% tuition reinbursement toward your BA or MBA. The only problem in my own words, is there is no program that will encourage you to excel after graduation."
good,"Lots of interaction with public, and a better understanding of public home entertainment wants and needs"
good,good company but don't take anything they say when it comes to making job easier or getting paid more seriously and be prepared to be treated worse then office staff they get special privileges and you do all the hard work
good,Good old boys club i tell ya seriously if your not drinking the kool aid don't bother applying i truly believe they want people who just do and don't care for customer wants or actual needs
good,Poor management with little direction.  Tons of pressure and everyone on your team is out for themselves.  Tons of driving with poor compensation for using your own car.
good,"very competitive "
good,The weekly  coaching seem to focus on what an employee is doing wrong.  If you consistently measure ones ability on the negative you truly dim there ability to perform at their full potential.   Coaching sessions were a true waist of time.
good,"In the fulfillment department, the job is stable, but it also limits you substantially to advancement. The job function itself does not challenge anyone mentally. It's more or less a matter of repetition and creating a good report' with internal customers."
good,"The culture at Comcast was one of a constantly moving goalpost. As soon as you achieved and were comfortable with your metrics, they narrowed goal line"
good,"Everyone wants cable but not at the price the company is charging!"
good,"When other agents cheat the system, the numbers for the metrics look inflated and it makes company raise metrics  it’s very stressful at times  a lot of agents have Fmla or intermittent to deal with the stress  the management is fake   They give us occasional food to appease us  if I could make the same amount or more money guaranteed somewhere else, I would leave  getting free services is a good perk"
good,"Positives:"
good,No comment at this time except that I felt stuck at the position with no ability to advance also I felt as if I was compelled to sell products to chat I.ers that they did not need and would be reprimanded if I did not do so. Tbe co her. Was not to help tbe gusto.er but to force the customer to purchase more
good,"Awesome people and experience, however, there were frequent layoffs and re-structuring that left employees feeling insecure about their futures no matter what their position.  In the meantime, Comcast offered great benefits,and now some  begin before your first 90 days in some cases. Comcast encouraged work/ life balance, and offered a generous maternity and paternity plan for parents. It is a great environment for diversity, too."
good,It is a good company to work for when it comes to benefits. Great health and dental and you get courtesy services. Biggest downfall is dealing with angry customers and having to fix other employee mistakes. Another  downfall is the company's inability to really listen to their employees and not base all decisions on analytics.
good,"Overworked and underpaid, that is how I described my Comcast experience. There is a separation of cultures between employees and contractors. I would not want to work for Comcast as a contractor again."
good,"The customer service is not firm. There a double standards. Everyone is not on the same page.  I think it is due to the constant change and personality driven customer service team. The human resource department seems to operate in the same fashion.  Other departments appeared to be a bit more organized.  "
good,I wanted to move up faster and raises are not guaranteed managment is all different so crucial scores for advancement are always in question which makes it hard
good,"If you're looking to simply clock in and collect a check bi-weekly with no intention of progressing, this is the place for you. If you start in customer service it will be very difficult to move up. The company does not consider your talent or accomplishments with the company when trying to move up. There is a robotic style of advancement, it is what it is. The people are great to work with but they are stuck in a dead end position. Some do the same thing for over 10 years with no advancement. The company is too big to notice the shining stars who deserve a better position which in turn will benefit the company. If they don't know your name throughout the company you won't move up."
good,Comast has great benefits buts lacks in upper management education of sales experience and employee recognition. The lack of upper managements interest in the challenges faced by frontline employees is failing both the business and the workers in their achievement of corporate goals.
good,one of the best parts of the job was we had a company van to take home so you didn't have the mileage on your car. we did have things that didn't go well you could be stuck on a job for hours with different problems but you were given the a set time to get the job finished
good,"Some parts of the environment there are healthy (flexibility, regular meetings, 1 on 1 coaching)"
good,"My time with Comcast was pretty cool at first . Training was smooth and “hitting the floor” was even better . Benefits are amazing ! The day to day culture definitely sucks . I feel like , it’s harder to “keep” your job than to “get a job” at Comcast . Majority of the supervisors will “ breath down your necks about everything”. With Comcast , “ one day your in and the next day your out “. Smh ."
good,"This is actually a great place to be employed, advancement is hard because every department already has there picks and choices made before interview. I never thought about leaving until im now stuck in a dead zone."
good,"High paced competitive work environment on the sales floor for Xfinity products.  Great place for sales agents to compete with other members of your team.  Also, open and inviting floor plan"
good,At first it seems like a happy family environment and management will always have your back...until customers call racist statements and you have to remain positive...Comcast has great benefits but it’s always changing...no consistency
good,"As an outdoor sales rep, Comcast does not really protect our job. Although they promise to change departments, they preferred to fire me stating that there was no position. There is no loyalty."
good,"Managers protect friends not solid producers. Some unethical outside sales people who have no turf integrity."
good,This was contracted position that I enjoyed working for but the company I subcontracted thru to get this job was charging employees for their training. This could have been better experience if I had worked for Comcast directly.
good,I was always busy. Company standard answer to everything is Business As Usual. Not much guidance or direction given. Performance reviews are a joke and no one reads or reviews them. Development plans are ignored.
good,"The life in a call center can be rough. Some days overtime is mandatory. However, if you get in sales, your hourly pay plus commissions make it worth the while, but you better be ready for long calls, an like to talk on the phone."
good,"As a Part-Time sales employee, you must meet your sales objective within a limited time frame. In other words, you will have employment for about 5-6 months if you miss your sales target."
good,It wasn't for me.  The customers were always in a bad mood and constantly yelled at you for no reason because of something you had no control over.  Really long hours too.
good,I was able to work in four different positions my time with the company.  I really do feel like they are big with promoting within the company.  I like that politics wasn't really involved.
good,It can be a fun environment but the goals change frequently and so will the commission structure but not in the sale reps favor. Sometimes the duties get switched but the compensation gets worse.
good,9.5 years with this company and hit a dead end in the job I was in. No assistance from manage to help promote to any advancement. Pay was low compared to local market costs. Great place for students and someone just entering the job market.
good,"This is a sales position that guarantees really nice hourly rate for first six months during training. Upon its completion, it drops down to $12.50 an hour, or commission, whichever is higher. Chargebacks must be taken into account, if planning on making paycheck on commissions. Great benefits, including free internet & all cable channels (still have to pay for equipment), plus four free tickets to any Universal theme park every year. "
good,"Comcast as a parent organization offers a great deal of employee outreach programs as well as developmental opportunities for their employees.  The involvement in those projects is sparse for Xfinity Mobile.  They continue to lose great talent because they don't harbor a community of learning.  The employees all work rather hard with no investment from upper management.  "
good,Management is now going back and finding ways to write up employees in hopes of them quitting or eventually getting fired. Additionally we have had people creating their own selling proce points to ensure increased sales.
good,"Comcast was a decent place to work, team collaboration is big and helps foster continuous learning.  Management can be a bit tone deaf and depending on your seniority your working schedule will probably not be ideal."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Comcast. I loved my peers, but my supervisor was in Philadelphia and I was in Denver. She very seldom reached out to me to see how my work was going and what I was doing."
good,Comcast it an okay company to work for. While working there you do get free services but you have to pay the equipment rental which is not a lot of money. At the time I was there they had a horrible point system and it will take a point one year to go away.
good,"it is an ever changing company that requires patience and dedication. i worked for the company for over 15 years, and i have worked in almost all aspects of cable and technical support both in the field and call center."
good,As a new hire you will be expected to work 1 pm to 10 pm. This doesn't allow for any work-life balance whatsoever. Management was also more concerned with smoking cigarettes and talking to friends then mentoring.
good,Need to promote from within.  very archaic sales systems.  Everyone is not on the same page.  Way too much internal competition.  Marketing needs to understand sales before they get into pricing
good,"It takes time to get into comcast culture ...."
good,"A typical day as an inbound call center executive can be stressful especially when things are beyond your control.  Although the calls can be stressful, they can also be beneficial i.f you're able to sell"
good,"You're literally assigned to a cubicle with your entire team around you. Rumors are taken to management quite frequently and drama is a common daily theme. Benefits are amazing so if you can keep to yourself and away from the drama, the benefits and hourly salary are definitely worth the hassle that the customer service of the job requirement(s) isn't too bad to deal with."
good,Management will make or break your experience at Comcast. The higher ups tend to hire in a way where their roles are not threatened and that trickles down. Day to day is generally calm but has its high moments. Work isn't bad and pay is average but there are many benefits. The company does make to make up for an unimpressive pay with all the perks.
good,"Benefits good and pay rate can be very stressful and not so flexible with personal life or emergencies "
good,"I should have stayed a technician and would still be there, I spent 25 years here started at age 19. I thought late in the game I wanted to get into management. I was wrong. It was the worst year of my life as a supervisor. There is definitely life outside of Comcast but I am trying to get back in as a Technician. I am a technology geek and am hands on. I miss the technology not the management."
good,I liked it for the first 3 years than I couldn't move up or down I was stuck on one task and I was doing a few different task and I wanted to move in a different department.
good,"this company use to be great, great environment and pay, but after 2 years in the sales department, commission structure changed every other month, so the commission continued to drop even though you may have sold the same or even more"
good,"This is a call center. Within the walls of this so called work enviroment was a whole lot of dram, so unless you are one who likes to stay to themselves and not socialize then i recommend that you steer xlear of here."
good,"Adverting is changing and Comcast spotlight is behind the industry trying to catch up ! Program, work life balance could of been improved ............"
good,"Being a Comcast communication technician is a great place to work if you just want a job. Career advancement is possible but only only comes with a 5% pay bump, so even as a senior technician youre still not making great money. Long days, hard work, and sometimes dealing with beligerant customers who hate the company and take it out on you."
good,My coworkers were great and they always tried to keep a positive work environment. I feel like the work load was not distributed appropriately and promotion opportunities were not available. That's why I chose to leave.
good,"I was a billing representative for the national accounts team I enjoyed my job and what I did. I went to work minded my own business, and I was fired for being 25 minutes late due to traffic. "
good,"I have worked for Comcast Xfinity for a while and I started to like the job when the company laid off the entire Direct Sales , completely let everyone from the sales force go with a very short notice"
good,"company on leading edge of technology for the field, sufficient support from immediate management.  focused on a great customer experience.  good Benefit package.  Technician job culture is good."
good,I meet some really great people while working there that made working in a call center interesting. It can be stressful at times dealing with billing and tech issues.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Comcat is, I get to make sure the customer always has quality service. Hearing how in the customer's voice how much they appreciate the part you played in restoring their service, meaning a lot."
good,I have no comment regarding this particular company.  It is in my past and I prefer to move forward at this particular time.  ........................
good,"Good technology, poor management and customer service. The job can be challenging. The opportunities for advancement are small. Lots of politics and little in the way of employee relations."
good,"Your typical day of work started from the house. You log into your phone to where your first job is and what it entails and you go from there. You typically have 8 jobs a day ranging from installations to trouble shooting. Management usually hold a meeting through conference call, and emails. you come in to the main office on days they have meetings and to pick up equipments. Its a busy job and helps you with time management."
good,"The C in Comcast is for change, and it's a good place to work if you are flexible and open to continual change.  However, the offices leave much to be desired.  Would recommend for someone starting their career."
good,"We have some great supervisors locally, but the upper management is pretty clueless about the product in this particular division and determined to weed out anybody that isn't a yes man."
good,The job is fine. The people who work in the company make it both a great place to work and also a terrible place to work. You can tell these differences as you move throughout departments. I believe the company needs more opportunities to advance. The culture sometimes promotes the attitude that where you start is where you finish. I feel this is a poor attitude because you come across so many knowledgeable and hard work people who are sometimes down because of the lack of opportunity.
good,"StreamSage was acquired by Comcast at the time I came to work there as a temp. They have a high turnover, and my immediate supervisor was replaced soon after I was hired permanently. The new hire seemed out of her depth, but was never challenged by anyone in authority."
good,"The job and benefits of the company are excellent, if you're a salesman you can do well, the problem lies in which location you're placed in. Not all locations are created equal, and although many are bad locations and need to offer different products, the company grades all areas the same.  This is not fair to the reps, but that's not of concern for the company."
good,"I worked at Comcast in 2012. The center that I worked at has now gone completely virtual, so they no longer have an office. I was unable to switch to a virtual position."
good,"Comcast is a atypical corporate work environment. If you're good at shmoozing you will go far, if you're just average then it will be a slow pace to the top of your job category. Good benefits, with okay pay that is slow to change. Continuous change in jobs, titles and management makes for a very rocky environment, at the doggedly slow corporate pace and provides constant excuses to employees for low pay."
good,"I worked as a technical/customer supprt representative and the job responsibilities is wide; billing, customer service, technical support, supervisor access. Low chance of work advancement."
good,My review as a temp it is a difficult position. If you work hard and get hired on by CTDI that is very good and will give you great benefits. I can be hard to get hired on. The management team there had direct control of who gets hired on.
good,Environment was fast pace. You learned different things in a day to day basis. Comcast is well known for their brand and their beliefs. Hardest not understanding why their stats were not reporting consistently or right. Enjoyable parts were working with delightful customers and resolving their issues it really makes you feel like you did your job to give them a better experience. Management there is very kind and respectful.
good,"Besides VISA, Comcast does a GREAT job in promoting people of color and women who are qualified. Comcast does not offer a reasonable salary until you are promoted, and the company fosters competition at every opportunity (i.e., your work shift can be taken from you, if another phone agent scores better in QA than you did for the month - which could disrupt child care or other family needs)."
good,"I am an IBO. That means I work for myself, remotely but i follow Comcast procedures and policies."
good,"great benefits "
good,"The call Center is stressing and demanding, your required to do other jobs that's not really yours by taking the over flow calls. Seems like there is not any real type of reward for you doing what you actually do except, ""keep going""."
good,"A typical day was setting up for students. bringing energy to the campus and then giving students. The team i had was phenomenal"
good,I had fun chatting with clients about the services that would benefit their lives.  I learned how to chat with customers in the south. I was not a fan of management took too many shots at reps if they wanted you out f there.  nothing really how about the job high turn over due to the operation of management.   Taking to clients made my day better.
good,"Pays the bills, but doesn't care much for it's employees. Training department especially doesn't do much as far as career advancement goes, and pay is below median for the area/position."
good,"Working at a call center is typically a challenging job, especially when calls are at peak and you work tech support and are obligated to sell products and services all in under 6 minutes. Colleagues were good at offering support so the environment was nice despite kind of being on your own with training/resources. Benefits were good and pay/advancement opportunities were there as long as you applied yourself. They hosted a lot of events for company picnics, holiday parties, and catering events among other incentives like commissions, bonuses and they even did 401k match. It is an exhausting job and not a lot of support via management but not a bad place to work. I'd probably still be there if they didn't shut down all the California call centers."
good,"This department in the call center was in it's first year when I started. So it had a lot of bumps in the road as far as policies go. I also think that the upper management didn't hire enough Team Leads that had actual leadership experience, and the ones that did didn't know the work so it was a mess most of the time making the job more stressful than it had to be."
good,Great place to work very laid back and relax the money is good if you can sell. The culture over there is really not that good they need to hire better quality candidates. Also 0 job security
good,"Think before you dive...This job is for people whom are out for themselves or are willing to join the clicks."
good,"Great job for a new graduate or as a transitional option while looking for another job.Turnover can be high unless you're in a division position. However, advancement and proper compensation in my location still seemed to be an on-going battle for most."
good,This is a workplace that strive for excellent and help services with the best quality of services. Teamwork is great with the team I'm on and sup is very consistent in performing his duties for the team.
good,Comcast was an experience that is suitable for some people but no everyone. The work was fine the customer satisfaction was hard to obtain. I would work for Comcast again.
good,Management seems to only listen to their own feedback and not the feedback of current customers and employees. Compensation was fair given the shortcomings as overall I still liked my roles within the organization
good,They have a high turnover due to they do not take of their coworkers by allowing customers to abuse the coworker. They do need to think of the customer but they need to treat equally.
good,"as a tech you are set up to fell with their number system"
good,"Great benefits and guaranteed 40 or plus hours per week but management was poor, customers extremely rude and very stressful environment..unless you knew someone on a personal level in upper management you could not advance"
good,"I would not in my opinion tell a friend to seek employment their.  I hated the office politics, and the lack of employee loyalty and job advancement opportunity.  Poor management and team players.  My suggestion is to keep looking.  Loved it when it was owned by AT&T!!"
good,"from a standpoint of benefits its a excellent place to work. But the lack of of job security makes for a stressful environment, with the added pressures of day to day customers inactions"
good,"They are advanced yes, but put you in a no win situation before giving you the right tools to do the job.  In my time with Comcast I have seen 3 Directors, 5 Managers and many employees churn in the Memphis region.  You must have a high stress level and willing to go out and get what you need to be successful."
good,"Disorganized"
good,"Management needed work, but most workers were helpful. Almost everyone helped out with job duties. Some were favored over others more deserving. Human Resources was not an open door policy at all."
good,Excellent benefits however difficult company with a lack of compassion for work life balance. Unfortunately the company does not pay well for entry level and therefore it is a revolving door. The pressure of customers on the phone is mentally tasking on most who are not self aware.
good,My career came to a stop when people stopped interacting and engaging with each other. Advancement was limited by so much red tape and oversight. My career was mostly good until the last 2 years.
good,"Our senior managers have a disconnect with their mid-managers, supervisors and frontline employees.  A typical day at work would be supervising a team of ten by setting goals, developing structure, onboarding new members and coaching them on working with competitive and sometimes difficult Account Executives."
good,"this company is not a bad place to work. it all depends on what you want to do and the type of lifestyle you want to live. Its a decent job, but now the huntsville area has you working from home so that may be a plus for some."
good,"install, maintain, and repair cable systems, most often involved with television and internet services"
good,"CSR work is can be very stressful. Dependent upon your supervisor the job could be workable or stressful. There are managers who seemed as if they wanted to fire you, others would lead you to a successful path for advancement. "
good,"It wasn't a bad job, the training was very poor, and the expectations and advancement were very poor. Overall, the job provided excellent health care and good discounts on cable. I would work for them again, but in a different capacity. The company itself was not bad at all."
good,"Positions in sales department are always fast paced with the focus on making this month's budget. Leadership does provide admirable awards, such as trips, for above level performance."
good,Comcast is a company that ask for you to go above and beyond but when you need them to do the same there's a no for the answer. Co-workers are pleasant and management is ok depending on who you deal with. Job is not safe and your department can close at anytime without warning. Severance package is a joke
good,"Fast paced call center enviroment, great discounts and benefits. Stock purchase plan is a great benefit that can add loads of value if you can afford to put money into it and the 401 k match."
good,Bring back the old days and incentives. Management stop being blind to the unhappy employees. Happy employees make happy customers. Happy customers drive revenue and make happy the stock holders happy.
good,"Comcast is a large company that, understandably can not always see all thier emplyees but really needs to pay attention to thier management decision making process. Very valuable people left the company that would increase so much structure for Comcast for other opportunities due to the issues with in departments. This company is a great company with so much potential."
good,The company expects too much for their employees with a ton of work hours making the pay unreasonable with the job responsibilities. They make it almost impossible to move up and to get any opportunities in the company mainly because its based on politics.
good,No job security. Laid off 300 of us with barely any notice. Then laid off another 200 without notice. Only 4 weeks severance. Sales centers are closing as they are opening more stores.
good,Comcast gave me a great opportunity but I would like more career advancement options with a company that is leading in the home entertainment and security industry.
good,"I learned several additional programming and software products when with Comcast.  I had an opportunity to grow and advance.  In my last position, I managed a team of report analysts. We were responsible for reporting on several different aspects of the company to upper management."
good,"Comcast is a face paced place of business. It's exciting with fun games spontaneously given daily. However, the Management Staff sucks. They choose their favorite employees and dread dealing with the rest. If you become chums with management you'll grown in the company and your job is secure. It's only when the Supervisors speaks openly to other supervisors on the floor in your face while walking behind you with derogative statements that makes you feel uncomfortable."
good,"Great 401, health insurance, paid time off  & discounted services. Hard to keep up with their number system, very physical job.  No pension/severance."
good,"I exceeded all sales goals, had perfect attendance and customer service and employee of the month awards, however, There was not any movement or advancement out of call center. I was given the chance to become a specialist , but it was the same job with added stress ."
good,Learned lots of useful skills which will come in handy for future endeavors. Was around a few decent co-workers. The other not so much but I can't complain.
good,My work day was pretty fast paced and a little stressful. The people I worked with and my immediate supervisors where awesome. I do not feel that the company treated us or compensated us as fairly as other offices in our region.
good,It was a nice place to work. Great building and atmosphere.  They gave free food and activities for the employees  and I'm sure they will continue to grow.
good,"in retention the goals are always changing before you get a chance to  adjust to them , almost like they are making it difficult for you to succeed ..."
good,"pay is only 15 an hour, take home pay after taxes and health insurance deducted for family is ONLY 300 dollars a week, a fortune 50 company that pays like *****"
good,very fast paced and active environment. constantly handling customer satisfaction issues. I have learned how to adapt to the fast pace I've also had lots of team building and management skills as well as leadership roles.
good,"Comcast has some major challenges as a company in the coming years with cord-cutting becoming the norm for millennials.  Comcast is a huge company and there is a lot of room for advancement, but I have found the work life balance to be less than desirable.  Management constantly forces unobtainable deadlines to get the most of the employees but it is terrible for morale and leads to constant stress and late evenings away from your family.  There are two kinds of people at Comcast - those who work very hard life myself, and those who seem to just eek by.  Unfortunately, it seems like even for those that work extremely hard, favoritism and the buddy system is what matters most when it comes to promotions."
good,sometimes a fu place to work for. The company is more goal driven. Managers do not have the correct and work ethic skills set. The need to improve but company is strong and good quality.
good,Great place to work with plenty of overtime hours available. Benefits are great as well as courtesy services. Management needs to implement a timeline for aspiring agents to see their progression into a leadership role.
good,The comcast division was a great opportunity to learn many  new skills. However the on going training and the ability to grow with in the division was very weak. The need of bodies at a desk out weighted the advance of growth needed as an employee. There was a lack of management growing team and being able to set attainable goals.
good,"walk in everything from yesterday is different,"
good,"Super fast-paced, priorities change on a dime.  If you have a very routine-focused personality, you likely won't fit in here."
good,"it is very inconsistent in what is told to you from supervisor to supervisor. however if you have thick skin its a great place to work. you are rewarded for what you do but when you don't replicate excellence its a red flag and must be fixed quick, ""I agree with this"""
good,"We would solicit incoming callers for cable, internet, telephone and security systems. It was my understanding that you could make a lot of money at Comcast. however, I feel like everyone was not on the same playing field."
good,A high sales pressure culture with minimal supports provided. Departments tend to be silos without much interactions.  Good benefits are available for employees.
good,"I liked the position, however the programs used to help customer are outdated and have lots of issues. Once they implemented sales as part of our matrix I was over it."
good,"Very stressful workplace any given day you will have 2-3 customers call in back to back sreaming through the phone. Not all the customers fault. Comcast CRMs are not reliable and the overall training for the company needs fine tuning. The work itself is a 1 star but the pay, benefits, and perks are 5 stars. Oh, and there is almost always free food."
good,"Manage team of 14 agents in customer care in the Repair Center of Excellence for Comcast.  Take all customer escalations, account reviews, overrides and scorecard metric analysis."
good,"Would recommend Comcast to a friend if they lived in Florida.  Florida has better job security at their Comcast locations there."
good,Not a bad place to work if you like the field of work can be very stressful at times. Sometimes it has unreal expectations they expect you to meet with little help.
good,"It was okay, however, there were no management. Every 6 months there would be a different manager. Managers would quit, too much work and responsibility. The staff is great, a lot of pressure to meet daily goals. If goals are not met it is a disciplinary action. The pay was good. The hours were more flexible if you're part-time. A lot of pressure from customers. If you can deal with constant yelling customers and keep in professional then this is the place for you."
good,"Selling new products to new and existing customer"
good,"Installation of internet, cable and phone"
good,working at comcast can be stressful. the goals are high and majority of the people do not make them. supervisors are usually cool but dont like to take difficult calls. my advice avoid tech support stick to billing half the work.
good,"This is a Great Company if you can find the place that makes you happy. An environment in which you feel comfortable enough to want to be there everyday . However, things like lack of management , support and communication between departments falls short causing the discomfort and the stress that comes with jobs. This is just a more high demand job and a lot is expected out of you only to receive little recognition and reward."
good,"supervisors always leaning over your shoulder after a 5 minutes on the phone with a customer telling you to wrap it up."
good,"The culture has become very cut throat. While I like being busy, I hate having to work through lunch everyday. I love the projects I work on, as my days are never boring. I wish they allowed for more Working Remote since ATL traffic is just getting worse."
good,This place is only good if you need a part time job. What you do on a regular is call customer trying to get them to upgrade there services. The hardest part of this job is trying to make sales.
good,"they change pay structure without notice for there benefit if they see your making good money the put you on a bad que and deny it"
good,This job is very stressful. a lot of people don't have a choice weather to get the service because it is the best thing going. the customer service is horrible.
good,"Just as the title says- the people are awesome, but you are on your own a lot with little formal training.  The base salary is very low, so unless you are hired and given a book of business, you will not be making much money for the first 12 months."
good,"I enjoyed working with Comcast in the beginning of my career. The training was great and everything you learned in training came in handy on the call center floor. Although the training is long its worth it because there will be similar situations that you will be in and you can help the customer out because of knowledge you have. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the irate customer who isn't willing to allow you to help but the most enjoyable part is the company parties, the discounted services, and the employee appreciation events."
good,"Learned a lot and met interesting skilled people. The pay was competitive and based on how hard you work. In a sense, you can decide how much money you want to make to an extent. The managers are helpful at times and harsh on others but that's lfie. Learn from it and move on with life."
good,Would never work there again. Left to look for something else. Training provided unless they suspect you are trying to advance out of the department. Hated it.
good,"Every day operations consist of receiving calls and making calls."
good,Had the best benefits.  The work environment is challenging in a good way and competitive.  They are great for offering room for growth as long as you have a manager that will support your decision.
good,everyday was different and a challenge. I never had everything i needed to get the job done. they were very unfair when it came to job assignments and things
good,"Early morning hours 5:00 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. home by 2:pm. Gave quarterly bonuses. Paid vacations, personal time and flex time. Paid overtime. They provide heath, dental, and vision insurance which is better coverage than a lot of companies provide."
good,"Overall Comcast is a company that has a strong appearance of ethos while not entirely adhering to it internally. All work is excessively political with everyone pushing their subordinates to suppress information or sabotage co-workers to get what they want, look better, or maintain a feeling of security. I have seen a number of times where information critical to projects is suppressed to prevent executive management from finding out about issues causing the projects to fail or be delayed."
good,learned how to work better with customers. also i learned how to defuse situations that have gone wrong. work day were slow some days And fast on others
good,Comcast is a great company but sadly this was not the case consistently in all regions.  I found this out when I relocated after 5 years to the Washington DC area.  There was no support from Management or HR.  I think there is still work that needs to be done on the retail front.  I highly recommend the New England and Keystone areas.  Best part about Comcast is the benefits.
good,Amount of work put on employees were unrealistic to the timeframes assigned which led to jobs not being completed efficiently. Equipment reused A LOT!
good,"The company as an entertainment company is great!!! However, the business practices there could use a bit of work. The pay could be so much better. Compared to other jobs in the same field Comcast pays the worst. The company when it comes to employees is very unorgaized."
good,When you go through training they sale the company really well by selling you the dream of xfinity but when you finally get on the floor then you see the truth.  They make it hard for you to get commission which is why you're working there.  It was a decent place to work but when they changed the commission structure it made it kind of impossible unless you have a bunch of money already and you're working there for fun
good,"In short, Comcast can't figure out what it wants to do. At least, not in the large-scale customer relations (not customer service) department. There's an inordinate amount of micromanagement for a job that requires a lot of independence, and twice-daily conference calls (although I hear this has gone down recently) to ""check in"" make it difficult to be productive. What's more, the job itself is poorly defined and changes weekly."
good,good company but stressful at time. Management does support but the company can put you under stressful situations and meeting quota can be very stressful due to the amount of sales they want you to obtain.
good,"Not the best or worst company to work for, but it has a very sink or swim environment. Management often changes and you must be flexible and a team player."
good,"I worked in the Customer Care LOB.  I came in as a contractor and was treated as an outsider.  8 months in i have had very little communications with any form of management.  The Director and EVP do not routinely address the employees, there is no actual leadership of display of direction.  That wouldnt be as bad if things were good but the LOB continually misses its KPI's and is running over budget.  Most of management has been promoted from the phones on up and i feel they lack the desire to do whats best for the company when it comes to the expense of demanding more the roles of shoes they used to fill."
good,"Great benefits, work atmosphere sometimes crippling due to lack of ability to address customer issues.  "
good,"Working for Comcast can be stressful with different personalities of customers; although, I love the work environment, great team to work with. The HR dept. is very unorganized you have to watch for your money, the pay is not good for all the duties you have and Comcast constantly add new duties with out increasing the pay,but benefit are the best. There is constant change which is okay with new technology increasing."
good,A fast paced job with changes happen regularly. Can be fulfilling. Can be a fun place to work. Pay was not in line with my experience. Advancement was not available for my position.
good,As a field tech you can expect angry people and overloaded work loads.  Management does not care about your family life and will schedule you with work that you are unable to perform forcing you to reschedule jobs.
good,I worked for Comcast for over 17 plus years and loved every minute of it. I enjoyed being able to trouble shoot issues from the office with the techs in the field. The techs made the job even more enjoyable. Loved the quick paced work and how busy it was. Never a dull moment.
good,"You work hard for about an hour then twiddling your thumbs the rest of the time.  The job changes constantly, with know fair warning.  Those changes include; job title, quota, offers, and peers."
good,Working for Comcast was easy in the beginning. Management was strict and porayed a micromanaging stye. Stats were used to monitor proformance. Not customer friendly. you were held responsbe when a customer would take longer than the average 5min call and your held accountable for tha.
good,"Great company with benefits just dont pay you enough money, when it comes to your raise the most you can get a dollar and that if your perfect on everything."
good,"Good place to work, as long as you are willing to put the company first and not family.  Disappointing that work can change at the drop of a hat with not much reason given."
good,This was one of the worst jobs at was ever employed at. The management is very rude and unprofessional. Training is a waste of time and there was always conflict on the job.
good,Great place to work if you want to devote your life off and on the clock. Live breathe and eat Comcast. Always make sure you call your supervisor before tucking your kids in at night to make sure it's okay!
good,The job was great. Meet a lot of great people compensation was great. The down side is that the top executives made decision to close all the business service offices putting a lot of people out of work.
good,I worked in the local Walmart at a set up table.  I dressed appropriately when working with the customers.  I was well versed on the products and answered questions posed by the customers.
good,I was a cable technician connecting customers cable and disconnecting it if they did not pay the bill in a timely manner as well.
good,"Company is great to employees but made job harder by poor offers for customers.  Really care for you, Could not work with medical note to keep my employment with them."
good,"If you can stand knocking doors and dealing with a bunch of red tape, theyll make it worth your while with the compensation. Great benefits and fair. Freedom is good but hrs are a bit hard to raiseba family 11am-9pm"
good,"As an inbound Sales Executive at Comcast the opportunity to earn a decent living has shifted. Being in the same position for over 7years my salary has fluctuated tremendously. Most of the employees think that it's deliberate on the Company's part. The IVR system is broke. Customer's often complain that the department the call was transferred to wasn't in fact the option they chose. Comcast expects sales reps to handle billing,collections,activations and tech support calls and sell on those calls. There are a handful of reps who never receive those call types. They are routed pure sales calls. We often complain about the call types and it fall on death ears. It has become increasingly hard to sell the products. After you have secured the sale, you have to fight to keep it for order stealing is rampant. There are other locations that don't follow proper procesures etc."
good,"It  has been a season of learning and growth with this company and a valuable experience."
good,I never had an issue with stress on the job. I loved doing the job. I was one of 5 who made it to the highest level to Tech4. If you want a job here prepare to be talked down to a lot and if you are you will be fine.
good,"Too big to know who to talk to to help customers or to grow in without being able to move across country. Too many restrictions on promotions, you have to be in your position for a year before moving."
good,"Great product, great people but they lack an overall vision. Tunnel vision doesn't permit them to see the big picture and this results in unhappy employees."
good,"A lot of outsourcers are used who don't have adequate training and are not held to the same standard as permanent employees. As a result we have a lot of unhappy subscribers. We are constantly trying to correct mishandled orders and situations. Calls are supposed to be 8 minutes long and when we help someone for all services longer than that counts against your rating as an employee, morale is at an all time low."
good,Comcast working environment (tech support agent call center) is very stressful. Management do not care and customers are just very difficult to deal with which make your experience as an employee worst than it already is...
good,"Super inexpensive cable and internet was the best perk."
good,Comcast is a descent company to work for. Challenges come everyday if you're a service tech. You get to work with the latest TV technology.
good,"The internship experience was fun and definitely an eye opener. good people to work with, but experience during internship does not lead to entry level work how it was often communicated."
good,Never had any major concerns with the company until I transferred to the Jacksonville branch. Where it seems that change is always happening. usually its a change in my pay by lowering my commission. Office politics rule the call center
good,"Greeted customers, welcome them to the store. As a sales consultant I not only sell but I listen to the customer’s needs and find a way to meet their needs. Fix billing issues, get them a service they wanted and didn’t know we had. Outside of customer care there are in office needs, supply order, stocking, data entry. Nightly close out with cash drawers, deposits, and deposit upload. In my first two years at Comcast I earned several Awards."
good,"This is secure job and some of the benefits are good, but overall a difficult place to work. Customer service, although on the surface seems decent, is severely lacking. Technicians can do anything and everything to support the customer and provide great customer service, but every other line of customer service is defective in many ways. Pay is very low in comparison to other communications companies and requirements for promotion are only getting more absurd."
good,"Learned many different software over the years and the company changed over the years to grow with changing times. Comcast Cable was a nice place to work but I figured I could work until I retired  after many years of service, they downsized and got rid of almost of the employees with seniority."
good,Over work and little to no time for family life.  The pay is enough to pay bill but not enough to keep you happy.  The company as awhole is great but some location's or horrible.
good,"Good physical job, keeps you busy.  Wonderful coworkers, great benefits.  Good working hours and overtime.   Experience in many different areas and opportunity to expand."
good,"It's a professional environment, but at the entry-level job I had, no creative thinking is allowed. Just keep your head down and your mouth shut, no matter how disorganized and counter-productive or counter-intuitive your job requirements are.  Don't try to help, don't propose better ideas, even if those ideas merely suggest common sense organization or productivity.  If you want to work for Comcast, leave your individuality and suggestions at the door. Your ideas when offered will be appropriated and you might get a pat on the head, no financial compensation."
good,Benefits are the best part of the job. NBC Universal really takes care of their employees. However salaries are really low and that dynamic hurts overall morale.
good,"For finance roles, pay particular attention to the line ""must be able to work nights, weekends, etc..."" they aren't kidding. I worked 60 hour weeks on average between work and home and it was never enough."
good,Comcast is a good place to work if you can get in good with management. If they don't like you - they will find a reason to let you go.
good,"it was a great place to work... I enjoyed my first thirty years there, they than decided to go in a different direction. I learned dispatch, installation, repair, maintenance, headend...digital transport, fiber routing and splicing, design, CMTS basics..digital delivery..."
good,The company is very strategic about growing and acquiring other companies to make it stronger.  There are many good people there to work with and learn from.  The company is constantly changing and therefore consistency and security is a challenge.
good,"Fun Job if your a fighter and want to resove rather complex issues. Good compensation, friendly managers, disorganized in every area of company"
good,"a typical day involves resolving bill issues,exchanging and giving equipment, is unclear and setting up accounts, dealing with irate customers"
good,It was a great experience working at Comcast both as a full time employee and also as a Contractor with Amdocs. There is always opportunities to learn and the full time co-workers work very well as a team.
good,"While Comcast is working diligently on improving the customer experience, what I appreciated the most about this organization is the commitment it finally made, albeit late, to fix its reputation spurred by social media."
good,When I come to work I come ready to work with positive attitude.  From working at Comcast I learned to deal with all types of customer good or bad in a professional matter.  At Comcast you work on a team everybody is encouraging and will help you anyway possible.  I have taking on a leadership role to answer any question take escalation if needed. The hardest part of the job is the stress level of trying to keep customer with the company and dealing with negative attitude when customer are upset also don't feel we get paid enough. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people day and you almost build a family within working with your team.
good,"I absolutely loved my co-workers at this job, most customers were also nice, but the job was very stressful due to a high volume of customers daily and though many were courteous there were an increased amount of upset customers.  Prices and call center representatives misinforming customers about packages was leading to a substantial amount of customers going to a different provider. For these reasons, the job was getting harder to tolerate.  The most enjoyable aspect was that everyone in my department got along well and worked together to help each other out. I gained a lot of customer service skills and knowledge of many computer programs."
good,"its something different every day. metrics can be tuff due to things that are out of your control, but yet stall held accountable for"
good,"Job deteriorated once new management appointed. A former supervisor physically threatened me and no action was taken by upper management after I reported it. One year later, this supervisor was promoted to Department Manager and I was let go. There were some trumped up charges and as long as I didn't seek legal council, they wouldn't fight my unemployment filing.  Of course, I had no recourse because you cannot prove physical harassment if there's no evidence. In addition, as NJ is an at-will state, I couldn't do anything further."
good,"Comcast could be a good company if they offered schedules that were more friendly to having a life. "
good,"The Management is poor over all, the supervisor talk very harshly to their technicians. They are very picky with your work to very T. The Manager always defends the supervisors over the technicians. HR is said to help out the technicians but that's not true. So over all it's all smoke and mirrors at this work place. They say don't sacrifice quality over quantity but then they complain about the amount of work you are completely. In reality you can try your best to do the most and best you can but that isn't enough for them because they keep asking for more perfect + perfect. Each supervisor preaches about what they want but at the end you still get lectured or talked down to."
good,"Comcast is a decent opportunity for college grads or for people who are between jobs. Every individual's experience is unique. The company habitually makes changes to their comp plan and requirements to get full credit for sales. There is an issue with favoritism and cliques that give some sales professionals unfair advantages. You can make pretty good money as an outside sales professional. $65k-$75k is a realistic expectation for your first year if you are moderately successful. The public's perception of the company is very poor and if you have problems after a sale, it is incredibly difficult to resolve your customer's issues. Overall, their processes are very complicated and the job can be very stressful. Lastly, the work/life balance can be a challenge for people with family obligations. Very few will enjoy success while others will find the job to be undesirable."
good,"Expectations are not necessary. Added employee statistics just to say they are doing something different, has taken away from employees commission. more likely put in place to keep more money in company's own bank. Don't fix something unless broke, they tried to implement something, they broke a good system and work culture, day to day, employees are less happy to be at work and constantly worried about not meeting lofty expectations. Comcast has went from a hard to enter company to a high turnover, revolving door company."
good,"Management is not able to handle the resources properly and hence very difficult to mange work. Agile methodology is just for name , but not in practice."
good,Nice company to work for. Clean facility. The most enjoyable part about the company was beginning about to get overtime when needed.
good,"this job with this company is a dime a dozen was what my super told me before he quit. i should of quit too, but i thought there would be room for advancement, boy was i wrong. great free service when you work for them but when you need help all doors close."
good,"Great co-workers make the difference"
good,call center rep. worked in billing and collections. virtual rep. crazy hours and days. goals and metrics. team player team leader
good,"Good company benefits and culture.  Mobility within can be a challenge, some lack of career path. Good people but can be political."
good,"The company is good to employees with benefits and the ability to work from home. "
good,"Comcast, is a nice place to work, highly stressful, and it is all about numbers, nothing else numbers, regardless of the call."
good,"Comcast is in constant change.  Their philosophy towards their business shows an atmosphere of change, and their common goals shows a capacity of evolving."
good,"Typical office job, the usual login logout to the computer."
good,"Great overall company culture and aspirations to treat their employees well.  However, very long hours with very little work life balance and no foreseeable time frame that this is going to get better.  I do love the fast pace and always changing environment, and no two days are the same which keeps the job interesting.  It has become increasingly difficult to keep staff, however, due to the nature of the job and the difficult computer system that the company has in place at this time in order to set up customers and assist them properly."
good,"The company has a great benefit package - discounted service; life insurance; medical, dental and vision insurance; 401k with company match; paid time off!"
good,Well established company with marketable suite of products. They are demanding but fair. It was a good company to work for.
good,Things are constantly being re-organized. The matrix management process hasn't been implemented in the most effective way.
good,very stressful fast paced job. i would belive if everyone is on the same page about things the day would got smoother. i do like that we have special events during the spring and summer months with nascar
good,"Making sure the customer services is up and working,I learn that there always something going wrong in and out the customers house.Management tell your business to everybody in the office not good managing skills.The workers is like my brothers and family i keep in touch with them.The hardest part about the job is when people so mad at comcast that they take it out on you."
good,When corporate plans change the contractor is cut loose immediately. I don't mind; it's the life. The application wants more spew here....sorry I keep it simple
good,"The best part about my job as a Technician was being able to do my job without any assistance. There's no book, no script,no one looking over your shoulder. I'm in control.The hardest part of the day was when you had to work hard in the extreme temperatures. Typically, I go in around the same time each day, and get off around my scheduled time."
good,Working for Comcast was very different because it was a company that t took over a  small town cable company.It  turned out  started out as a tech job and turned into a high pressure sales job.
good,Comcast is the country's largest cable company. Indiana is a small part of this large company. Poor management and customer service are staples of this company. I can't do either of those things poorly.  Great benefits and pay at the time that i did work there.
good,Compensation is the best part of this deal. Long hours and intense dedication are a must. Good benefits and corporate communication are plusses.
good,"During my employment with the company, I gained a lot of knowledge within my leadership role.  My knowledge was mostly self taught through years of hands on experience and interacting with various other departments throughout the organization; however, there were many training courses that I took advantage of as well."
good,"Good company, and people really dedicated to their customers. The hardest part was making metrics and trying to advance. They make it extremely hard to get promoted."
good,"Month to month our requirement is meet a quota, which is attainable but through the months becomes harder to hit due to more work falling in your lap.  The position is labeled as account executive but should technically be account manager.  The work load is not the problem, but when the problem is out of your range of influence it becomes and constant issue.  Management works hard and does what they can to get their associates the help they need but their hands are tied by upper management.  The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new types of people daily.  Really going beyond your comfort zone and believing that your product will make the lives of people better."
good,"1 of the 2 trainer's unprofessional, not compassionate. was fired for silencing my vibrating cell phone when sons pediatrician called me. I had Dr's note showing son had to go to emergency room but they stated it was a 0 tolerance policy. I did NOT pull phone out or take call. I simply silenced phone"
good,The day would be routine take calls every day through out the day co workers are friendly management was not the best the a lot of changes were made in m short year the most enjoyable part was my co-workers the hardest part was dealing with other departments there would be inappropriate transfers all the time which affects commission
good,"Company relies more on sales support then in customer support. Very poor quality training for phone and field support. New tech is rushed into system without proper research, testing and training of support personnel. Causes great stress on customers and the Comcast Customer Support Personnel."
good,"Company has great benefits to include 401k company match, heavily discounted Comcast services, Universal discounted tickets, etc.  Ability to learn a tremendous amount given the varied facets of the overall business."
good,"Hard work pays off as far as metrics."
good,I love serving others and fixing things so customer service and technical support is exciting to me which make my job easier. Working for Comcast is fun once you learn how to balance the stress from management and irritate customers.
good,"Comcast warehouse Hub in Capitol Heights Maryland, need to undergo a cleaning house in management.Terrible directors and management, human resources need to undergo an investigationGreat Supervisors!! As well as employees."
good,"Pros: Never had to worry about the company going out of business, to a certain degree can ""pick"" your own schedule, good benefits, close to I25, clean, safe, good people to work with (not necessarily for).."
good,I liked working for Comcast on some days but most days were very complicated due to lack of communication between the customers and the contact center representatives.
good,"Comcast was a fun environment. A typical day included managing a team of up to 30 Sales and Service Agents who took incoming calls from customers. I would review live and recorded calls and provide coaching and feedback to improve performance and customer experience."
good,"Prospecting via Cold Calling and Call Blitz to uncover companies who are in need our products and services.  Establishing rapport with business owners and referral partners.  Scheduling face/face appointments and presenting presentations, quotes and service order agreements.  Close the sale and process orders; complete the day with data entry of activity in Salesforce."
good,Job not hard but management is iffy. co workers were kool. enjoed the freedom the most.
good,"days are filled with customer follow up and retention. Customer service does not work hard often."
good,Its nice helping people fix their issues when they are nice to you. Thats about it.
good,"A typical day at Comcast varies in duties.You could be installing service for a customer or troubleshooting, repairing signal and fiber issues. I have learned a lot from Comcast, from basic cabe theory to advanced enterprise solutions. It was at Comcast I realized the value of team work and how any obstacle can be overcome when dedicated people put there various skill sets and abilities to work. The hardest part of the job was not having the ability or resources to fix an issue to a customers or at times to your own personal satisfaction. As for the most enjoyable aspect to the job, it is the complete opposite, the customer satisfaction."
good,"I have already written a review on Comcast. Bad Customer service, relaxed environment elsewhere within the Comcast footprint"
good,Comcast is a okay place to work. The company needs to work more on  developing its management team and customer service/care  teams.
good,Great place to learn how to fix stuff because there are a ton of things that break all the time.
good,"My typical work day consists of driving to various locations offering  Comcast packages to new customers. I've learned how to approach people in many different way read multiple types of body language an sales pitches. Management wasn't the best i researched my own tips an tricks there was no proper training. I managed my own little team with things I've learned. My co-workers were fun,bright,smart,leaders who wouldn't take no for an answer. The hardest part of my job was the wear an tear on my vehicle, most enjoyable part of the day was the rush talking to people to get them to sign up with Comcast"
good,This was a fun job and showed good patience and allowed for personalities to be a part of the work. They had a great environment and the Management was Hands on and showed good communication. Their Human Resources Dept was poor and did a bad job with communicating in bad situations. They could have done a better job with training
good,"Most direct management understands and are supportive but have little to no power to change the situation created by those above and out of touch with field ops."
good,"Typical Day At Work"
good,Most days would sit at a desk and sell cable and interent services. I learned how i can handle a problem without having to call tech services. management was for the most part ok to work with when you had a problem. I had a blast working with my coworkers in other offices. I part that was the hardest part about working for Comcast was when customers came in with a problem yelling and there was nothing you could do to help. The best part of the job was when you could help the customers and make them smile and the discounted cable services.
good,"Ok company to work for, good benefits, management in denver needs a review."
good,A typical day at work was very productive and great opportunity to learn new prospects of all areas of the business
good,Hire many account executives at low pay. Too many sales people calling on the same accounts.
good,Overall a good company and they are making strides to get better
good,can go through a lot of management. jobs is rewarding if you can put up with being micro managed.
good,"I enjoy not being micro-managed with my employer and my supervisor is very understanding and professional. A typical day consists of creating a route pertaining to the number of customers in the region in which I work. I go to various customer's homes to retrieve their equipment due to delinquent accounts. I've learned how to be extremely patient and also calm and understanding. I rarely interact with co-workers as the job is very independent in nature. The hardest part of the job is remembering ""the customer is always right"", although sometimes they aren't. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I can work at my own pace."
good,"Overall good company to start with professionally. Longterm not so much. Too much politics involved to move up the chain. All about who you know and not what you know. Great benefits, pay is average."
good,"Great products. The trainers and the training is great but too much at once in some cases for a product or feature that they won't be rolling out for months, then it either doesn't roll out or the calls just roll in  with no heads up. It seems like sometimes it was all about hurry up and wait."
good,Performance measurement metrics ill defined and changeable...
good,"Answering calls and assisting customer."
good,"Getting my cash drawer ready when my shift began.  Taking care of payments cash, check, money order and/or credit card.  Exchanging equipment.   Had to offer a product with each customer no matter if customer is happy with service or not. With the co-workers, there were no team players so it made it hard to ask for help from someone other than waiting for management to come when they had time.  The hardest part of the job was getting spit on, yelled at, equipment thrown at you.  The most enjoyable were the special customers that would bring gift cards, cash, candy, and cards to you as thank you's.  They were the special ones."
good,"No complains on payscale but they need the upper management to be retrained. Supervisors are always ""busy"" even though  they are not, i caught one of them working out in the call center gym on work hours for a very long period of time and when i asked them why, they said it was too slow when 4 of the reps needed supervisor assistance"
good,working for Comcast was actually great if I could I would work for them again. I enjoyed talking to different people on a daily basis. plus the benefits were good
good,Typical day consisted of taking anywhere from 100- 150 average inbound calls. I was able to take advantage of several great training classes which help advance fairly fast. Great co workers from all backgrounds and the hardest part of the job was the shift times and the constant change of shift.  Working for Comcast gave me the opportunity to learn a lot of needed skills which I have utilized since and continue to today.
good,"In taking a lot of irate calls."
good,"A typical day at work was answering nonstop calls about customers having issues with their internet and phone services. Most of the time they were easy, resolvable issues but the others either needed a technician to come to their home or a higher fix agent to fix their issue within 24-72 hours. I have learned how to be patient no matter what. Management was helpful if they were not bogged down with their own tasks that had deadlines. My co-worker turned out to be some of the most kind and funny people I know. The hardest part of the job was the hours I had to work. Friday - Tuesday 3:30pm - midnight. I have worked just about every weekend for over a year. It weighs heavy on my family life. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers. For the most part, dealing with the customers was the best part of the job."
good,"On a typical day you would take around 30 calls, and the calls would vary between sales, billing, and repair. The best part of the job would be your co-workers, you will find that in this job you will develop a kinship that you will rely on during hard and good times. The hardest part of the job will be the lack of communication. Also you will find that being in a big company like Comcast, making changes to anything will be very difficult."
good,"I did love my job and reviewed going to work each as a challenge.  However I discovered too late that the support from management was minimal.  Each day I arrived 15 minutes early to get ready, retrieve my cash drawer, check supplies and check inventory.  I was always anxious to get started each day, our goal was to sell the products, cable phone, internet and home security.  My co-workers and I was very supportive of each other.  The program we worked on was riddled with problems and management did not understand or did not want to understand the program problems each day we encountered.  We just muddled through as best we could, this was the most difficult part.  This problem usually occurred when selling and trying to add the additional product onto an account.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when you met the goals given and most times I did, but it was not the support we received that helped us achieve it.  The webinars supplied was helpful and I was always first to access them and learn the new products and selling techniques supplied."
good,"A typical day here would be very busy and chaotic, yet very productive."
good,Often busy great professional environment in which your learning new things everyday.
good,"Comcast is a solid company, one just has to find his or her area within it. Different roles, departments, and managers will all offer different opinions. I know the xfinity sales consultant role can be stressful because they work the heck out of the full-time staff and some of the managers, who BTW, are poor managers, often make the consultants feel dispensable by way of intimidation. The pay can be okay, even part-time because one can earn commission. They sometimes have you drive far even when it may be a closer (store) location to your home. They don't seem all that concerned about the people as much as the bottom-line, which is why they often lose quality people. However, it seems they are trying to make progressive changes, so we shall see what the future holds."
good,I was contacted daily from customers concerning there billing or adding on new products to there current account. The experience to assist customer is a awesome responsibility
good,A typical day at work will allow you to interact with many different people from all walks of life that will have a definite impact on how communicate with people.  I have learned a great array of skills that have helped me as a person and furthered my skills as a person.  Management can be very informative to a point but the size of the company and how departments interact is very bureaucratic which can cause great frustration with many people that might look for promotions to other areas of the company.  This is not to say that you should be promoted right away but just expect that for the majority of good employees you will stay in the job family you were hired in for the duration of your career or employment with the company.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the adverse conditions that you are faced with on the streets and alleys that you will work in through the day regardless of what is going on there.  The most enjoyable part of the job is having the chance to show someone all the features of a product as well as resolving any issues that they may be facing.
good,"As a b2b rep with the Company I can definitely say that outside sales is challenging but not impossible. Comcast likes to reward it's employees for the sales they make.Although it's very rewarding, I think that some management can make the position really tough. Actually make the position tougher than it is. If you like to be micromanaged every day or don't mind it then you would enjoy the position. There's a lot of freedom in the position so you have to be careful and not get carried away from your tasks. I would've like to stay longer but my manager did a lot of negative reinforcement so it made me uncomfortable to be there."
good,My day is never the same as part of management. I'm challenged daily with multiple tasks and employee development. Working with my fellow co-workers for support and further growth of the  company's services and brand. The hardest part of my job is getting the complete buy in of some on my workers and the red tape of other department when trying to assist a customer. The most enjoyment I get from my job is solving problems and seeing the reaction on a customer face once an issue is resolved.
good,"Everyday is about the same.  I have learned a lot about computer usage and troubleshooting and I really enjoy that.  I work with some very nice co-workers and we help each other as best we can.  Sometime you get a change to speak with very interesting customers and that makes the day more enjoyable, and on the other hand sometimes people can be very rude and nasty, but thats when the real challenge comes in to continue to be professional no matter what they are saying, never take it personal."
good,Work was fun and very competitive. The money that was made is good for a college student or someone right out of high school. Telesales is definitely not for someone with children and real bills. I enjoyed the hours but it was just not the money that I needed to make. I did enjoy my supervisor and the one on one coaching did help with the teams. If the pay was different I would definitely go back to Comcast.
good,"Comcast is a decent company to work for no matter how negative some might portray it to be. "
good,"The people work as hard as I've seen anywhere and are equally as dedicated, but some of the management will be buzzword-heavy and do little else but spout them."
good,They have many celebrations each month to keep morale high. Management doesn't have time for the employees that may require a few minutes of 1-on-1 time. They get rid of employees frequently to keep some of their costs down.
good,A typical day at work included classroom training and field training of new door-to-door sales representatives.  Co-workers were great and fantastic to work with; there was true teamwork involved in the day-to-day activities with the sales teams.  The hardest part of the job was working with those representatives who had no drive or passion to learn and grow.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a new representative achieve and exceed their goals and have such passion for the sales role.  Their success was my achievement and success.
good,does not understand the basics of running a business everything hired from within.
good,Benefits are wonderful.  As an exempt employee management will expect excruciating hours to be worked; work/life balance is extremely unbalanced.
good,"Co-workers were great to work with. Management needed to be more professional. Provided assistance to the sales executives in handling their sales contracts. Hardest part of the job was to get assistance when needed from management, everyone seemed to point fingers and pass the buck.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the sales executives and technicians."
good,"This is about Comcast.  Once a year they would have CSR appreciation. "
good,"Jobs are hard to come around these days, especially one with benefits. Comcast offers great benefits but lack in values and assistance with employee matters. The supervisors got where they are because they performed numbers; This may sound effective, but in reality not all high performers are great teachers. I only have a few things to complain about, the supervisors are too busy to assist their employees and their knowledge level seems to be programmed to check web documents. You will get the repetitive ""check Einstein answer"" and you might end up waiting 20 min on the phone until you either decide to transfer that question or inquiry to another representative or make up an answer and move on. So, basically they supervisor staff sets you up with opportunities to produce poor customer service. Don't get me wrong, if you're working to make ends meet and want discounted cable, good health benefits, and a chance for overtime hours, Comcast is a great place to work. If your main concern is for people, it just seems like a long stretch to me."
good,took calls and helped to try and fix cable over the phone. I would also try and upgrade the customers to use all of the services.
good,"This is a good company depending on how familar you are with a call center enviroment recently comcast has taken over 11 markets that they thought would benefit the compnay but back fired on the employes employees are taking pay cuts of $1000 or more a month and have put employees on plans for basically not making enough money employees are penalized for it. a bonus is your always getting catered lunches, gift cards for $25-250 a month for doing good on sales but just be ready to take a pay cut in sales because times are hard."
good,I was not her long but this is a good place to work. This job opens you up to the world of cable. There is so much to do that this don't get old at all. Figuring out the problems with the product was very difficult.
good,Comcast is a very busy environment. Comcast has really taught me the definition of team work. I absolutely enjoyed my co workers because of the support I received from them. The hardest part of this opportunity had to be the lack of communication within management.
good,Of course I knew this was a sales job going in but I didn't realize how pushy they wanted us to be. They wanted us to sell the highest cable package to a little old lady that just wanted her public television. I just couldn't do it
good,Comcast is the only available project at this Convergys location. Team Leads were sometimes only interested in bettering themselves rather than their whole team. Sometimes didn't get promised bonuses from Comcast as a result of sales.
good,"Typical day working in the HQ would include:"
good,"Assisting Account Executives with every day sales activities, placing orders, answering emails from both clients and sales people, and dealing with the rigors of selling advertising."
good,"Daily, customers were upset with poor quality installs, missed appointments by installers, or outages. Management wanted more up-sales which makes saving customers harder for employees. Many times I would spend my breaks, or even on my days off contacting customers on my own time to make sure they were taken care of. I would have to contact dispatch personally to push to get someone to take care of a customer. "
good,Nice company on the corporate level but poor management. The company seems unconcerned about individuals families and the impact that the employer has on it. Hardest part of the job is coming to work every day because its always something new and dumb and stupid processes that were implemented by people who dont perform the job. 
good,A typical day at work would go in around the afternoon and get off early morning. The people there are good team players. It would be long hours in a day sometimes in very humid temperature. Hardest part would be keeping the place clean at all times. funnest part would be lunch because its an hour break to yourself while most jobs only offer 30 minutes.
good,"Comcast SportsNet is always busy because Boston sports are always buzzing. Our core group of producers and members of the production staff are great to work with, and we all have excellent camaraderie. The hardest part of the job is never knowing what to expect, because that's just how TV goes! But the reward is that we all come and go from work and love what we do for a living, because we get to talk about sports all day.  "
good,"was an ok job and decent money from commission however, no room for advancement. "
good,"My day starts at 7:30am with a conference call. I sign into my handheld device and a off site group assign work to us, normally 2 jobs per two hours (8-10, 10-12, 1-3, 3-5 ,5-7PM). I call each customer before arrival and speak with them to understands their needs and do all I can to complete it. I also have to make sure the company network is secure by running test based on cable signal. The hardest part of the job is getting all the work done within the time frames and getting to the next job on time. I do enjoy being alone to complete the job with little supervision. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Comcast due to the family work environment. It was challenging to talk to customers, especially the disgruntled ones, but it taught me patience and understanding. I also feel as though Comcast improved my sales skills a great deal. Management was a challenge as well due to poor communication and high demand for sales but the complimentary services and commission made that aspect a little easier to deal with. "
good,"I learn that you always have to be ready for change "
good,working here was very stressful and the customers were very rude.  management only cared about the numbers and not really how to fix anything.
good,i looking for my future  and i think that my future is going to be cablevision
good,"Excellent benefits. You can really make money BUT you have to be committed to work during the weekends. Also the best working schedule during a weekday is from 5 pm to 9 pm (this was the hardest part of the job)"
good,"Ideal job working in sports media, helping cover New England professional sports franchises. Progression and advancement is very slow."
good,"assist sales reps with orders, friendly environment, about 100 employees locally, alot of positions are centralized, able to deal with local businesses in the area, very easy work"
good,Good place to work ... great team work among employees. i enjoyed working for comcast
good,"Phone work, calls per hour quota & sales quota requirements."
good,"great people work at comcast, but advancement is slow ."
good,"This Job tought me to always be on my best behavior. Fun,nice co workers. job Security wasn't comforting."
good,Fair place to work. For me Comcast is a steeping stone to something better.
good,Comcast is a good place to work for the overall experience. It has proven to be a stressful work enviorment due to the needs for improvement in the the way the company shares communcation. They continue to offer good incentives to thier employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was to be able to work closely with others due to me a people person. The hardest part of my job was that there was no structure or consistency with the how things were done as a company with both there internal and external customers.
good,Typically i am constantly busy with an abundance of projects that change on a monthly basis
good,Sketchy management and little support for field sales reps. Service quality is good but not consistently. Hardest part of the job was overcoming company's poor reputation in a competetive marketplace. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and helping improve their residential telecom experiences.
good,on the phones all day ( call center ).. i have learned great customer service communication skills here at comcast. great co-workers and enjoy coming in every day. my most enjoyable part of my job is being there for the customers and keeping them.
good,"Comcast has great perks as far as complimentary cable, internet, and phone services. However if your a call center employee don't expect to much. a typical day is spent recieving phone calls and assisting customers. Co-Workers are awesome and easy to get along with. Most people enjoy working in the call center however if you don't like helping others then this isn't the job for you."
good,"There is always something to do in the warehouse. The only down times is when a machine breaks and slows down the process of productivity. The management is a great. My co-workers are very well trained, The hardest part of the job is not knowing what you are in store in the beginning of the day. The most enjoyable part of the day is learning something new to make your job enjoyable."
good,Working for the 76ers and Flyers was a dream come true. My compensation and hours were not. I worked mostly overnights getting the arena ready for the next day's events. I typically worked 6-7 days a week and a total of 70-80 hours a week and made next to nothing in compensation. The employees were great and I learned a lot about people and management.
good,"I worked for comcast through a call center. I liked working for the company, Just didnt like how rude the staff at the call center was."
good,"This warehouse issues tested, cleaned, and packaged cable modems, routers, phones, DVRs, and digital cable converter boxes to contractors, satellite warehouses, and service centers in the Houston area. The warehouse is cold in the winter and hot in the summer. There is an air of gloom in the entire atmosphere. It is a depressing place to work. The employees do their jobs on a daily basis to the best of their ability, but they are not a happy group of people. There is no guidance from management. There is no positve reinforcement by management. The employees doing the daily work seem to know more about what is going on than the supervisors. There doesn't seem to be much planning ahead by supervisors. Employees are rarely told that they are doing a good job by management, but are reminded of the disciplinary action that will be taken if anyone steps out of line. We are told, by management, to not make decisions on our own, but to always check with supervisors first to begin a course of action in a given situation. There are so many sad faces at this place that, in the morning or anytime of day, I try to bring a smile to those faces and say a kind word of encouragement to my coworkers."
good,My typical work day is filled with new challenges. Im always learning new thing about our clients business needs and goals.
good,"Worked in a payment center. Received payments in cash, check, money order, and credit card form. Add and remove equipment."
good,"Responsible for supervising employees; customer service; shipping and receiving merchandise training new employees; completing daily paperwork; opening and closing the store; Pick up and deliver cable boxes,and general upkeep of entire warehouse"
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for, they take good care of their employees."
good,Go off lead sheet and find customers that Comcast was right for.
good,very Challenging work days. I've learned how to effectively troubleshoot a cable system. Management is pretty fair. My co-workers are great.
good,A typical day at my workplace is routine and is overall a good job. But I would like to further myself in the work world. I would like to utilize my skills and abilities I have obtained over the past couple of years.
good,"my role was retention customer account executive, and my main role was to save customers who were potentially looking to leave the company. it was a call center environment. majority of the time the call volume is high, meaning no time inbetween the next call. you deal with a bunch of irate customers who feel like you owe them something or complaing about the price of the service. you have to be professional at all times even when your getting yelled at or cursed out for something that you as a person did not do. the pay is ok especially for individuals who don't have an colege eduction. i grossed almost 40k with not over time in 1yr. they have great competetive incentives."
good,"When I first started with the company, I loved going to work. I would work from sun up to sun down and had fun doing so. As time went on, new management came into play and everything changed. Everything became more stressful and the moral of all the workers started to decrease. Everyone started getting written up for the most simple of reason, until it seemed like everyone was walking on eggshells. The pay and benefits were outstanding, but the job itself became a burden and something regretted when waking in the morning."
good,I enjoyed working at comcast loved being on the road working with people solveing and troubleshooting issues with cable recovery.
good,"the only thing good about the company are the benefits, they make it sound like anyone can progress there, they play favorites and punish anyone who uses their ""open door"" policy, management has bent the rules so the can promote people who are unquailified and whine, and punsh those who work hard to progress"
good,Overall Comcast is an OK company to work for with room for growth. They are still a bit ruff around the edges.
good,Comcast is a good company as far as benefits and a potential career. Management is never on the same page as the technicians. Do not pay technicians fully for the work that they do. Takes strong physical ability to perform the installations.
good,This is a great place to work when incentives are given for hard work. Not the best place to work when the commission plans change 3 times in a year. Low personal accountability; people often cold transfer to avoid the call. Some deceptive deals are made to close sales to meet rising goal metrics.
good,"good customer service and great products, great place to work, great benefits and perks"
good,"Fast paced environment, high call volume, must be built to handle high stress situations and be great problem solver."
good,Not the best enviornment to work in. Its almost impossible to advance out of the telesales department.The turnover rate is to high and not a good career move.
good,this is a good pace to work but the work is non stop .... i was on the phone from the time i punched in until the time i punched out .... little to no down time
good,Great place to work only if no personal issues arise. Its either their way or the door. They act as if they are on your side but if you cant follow their companies rules then there's no room for growth.
good,For the most part it’s a good company just watch out for the management team don’t believe what they say.I would suggest making sure that you cross all your Bases
good,"During my rather short tenure with Comcast, I was shuffled around so many times that I didnt know who was who."
good,I felt like all I did was raise every customers bill and could not help them with lowering their bills.  Customers would come in consistently and complain about how high their cable bill was.
good,"Comcast was such a busy role to be in as far what agents do in their job title to the chaos that endures in the call center itself. Services are available, then they are not which can cause confusion for the customer and the agent."
good,I love that type of work and also seeing my customer happy at the end of the day was one of the best things to me. But I always had problems getting all of my pay for the work I’ve done.
good,"Honestly speaking, this is pretty dead-end as far as jobs go. You can move between states and such pretty easily but it is rather common to hear about or meet fellow sales consultants that have been in the same position for 10-20 plus years. Sadly what fast tracking and promotions that the company does from with are seen mostly from those in the call centers as retention personnel over those in a retail store location. The only thing that makes the job remotely decent is the health, dental, vision, retirement and service discount plans."
good,"Pay is not inline with the cost of living or fair to even what other companies receive.   Local leadership tries to take care of us but on a lot of things the company seems to have their priorities mixed up.   Employees are not the first priority or even 2nd here but there are worse places to work. People who stay are ok with their lives but everyone who leaves says they are happy they did. You get a company truck and they have a good benefit package, If you can survive to make it to higher Ct levels then you can be apart of some pretty cool events and special customers."
good,"This job was good for me at the time do to the ability to sygn up for the shifts I wanted/could work. The pay was not the best, but it allowed me to fill in hours of work that I couldn't get at publix."
good,Has very high expectations of employees but pay does not reflect that. Company needs to raise pay to make the amount of work expected to be done worth it. Also long days and plenty of meetings 100+ miles away on weekends. Not a family friendly job choice in other words.
good,A typical call center work day. Did not learn anything because its a typical call center job. Management is like any other call center hope you get in good with the people in charge if not your screwed. I liked the culture they tried to make it a fun work place always had something going on. Dealing with my supervisor was the hardest part of my job. The job wasn't that hard so i was happy about that and payday Friday treats.
good,I was part of telemundo which is under NbcUniversal as a day player which is above simply a regular extra for several tv shows in Spanish but the job wasn't secure and pay isnt good unless you're constantly on call.
good,"A lot of travel required.  Commissions were only paid if you met the sales target, so if you missed your target by one rgu you were not paid. Reaching people can be difficult.  You required to work rain or shine."
good,The job is very stressful so what it lacks in the physical departments it makes up double for the mental. The benefits and commission is wonderful but we are treated like a way to get the company rich and not like employees. Management does not take the stress of the job i  to consideration ans it always feels as if you can easily be replaced. If you being to make too much money from commission then the higher ups changes the commission structure to basically keep you in a box. The stress outweighs the money at the end of the day.
good,"Unorganized management, constant change, poor communication. Awesome perks and benefits. Pay is below average. Opportunity for advancement and ability to relocate within the company."
good,This particular position was stressful because I dealt with irate customers and non-stop inbound calls. The hours were also late so it was hard to have a life outside of work. It was basically a call center.
good,One of the things that made this job so stressful was the customers that you spoke to were very hostile and rude most of the time.  I feel that comparisons were made to often.
good,"If you like having amazing benefits but in a stressful environment this is the place for you. You usually will get stuck with a bad shift and never 2 days off in a row, they do pay more for the later you work at least."
good,Management wants you to lie to the customers to retain their business. If you are okay with that you can make a lot of money. Very competitive sales environment.
good,Comcast promises workers the ability to advance within the company but it is very hard to. No one wants to leave their position so there is very little room for growth
good,Comcast store management was always changing. Store managers were never consistent in their management skills. There was no room for advancement unless you knew someone higher up in the company. The workplace was very competitive pitting each customer service agent against each other.  I enjoyed working with the customers and grew very fond of them. They offered great benefits
good,"not a bad job, commission structure sucks, when i hit the sales floor 1ST year i made $68K , 2nd year $57 and 3rd year $46K.. the compensation  plan is not good, to many caps, and monthly objectives are not attainable with the calls that Jacksonville location gets daily. Not bad to have kinda of free cable depending on your employee package."
good,Satisfying customers will make going to this job worth it. I learned allot which made me proficient. I was awarded with bonuses for upgrading packages and making sales in addition to troubleshooting customer's video equipment and taking bill payments.
good,"High stress environment. You always have to be worried about meeting metrics that are not reasonable. If uou don't meet them, you will be let go. High turnover."
good,A lot of your salary was based on how many packages you could sell and I didnt feel it was right to try to force packages on people especially the elderly and their low income
good,Great place to break the ice with your sales career. Use it as a stepping stool dont get comfortable if you have a family or any type of illness. They dont care period. Back spasms on the job even with doctors orders you have to stay for a full 9 hour shift
good,"Comcast pays WELL below the market for professional positions. And if you're a white straight male, you can basically kiss any chance of advancement GOODBYE!"
good,"Like all call center rentention jobs, expect to be extremely stressed, expect additional stress from supervisors who no longer take calls to tell you how to speak to your customers, and I will say out of all the call centers I worked in Comcast has the angriest customers, they are also one of the most expensive providers and would not take into consideration what all retention agents are telling them, lower the pricing so we can retain the customer, they have the worst commission payout, I worked for dish and made my monthly income in a week."
good,"While the Benefits and very structured environment can be nice, and the free services were very nice, they refuse to accept emergencies or sickness..."
good,"Stressful, hours are crazy, good team work though. Management is hit and miss, some supervisors are very helpful and others will do bare minimum at best."
good,Comcast has grown into an entity bigger than its original humble beginnings. In the beginning had a clear focus but after so much customer demands they ended up bending to the whim of the consumer so much so that it poisoned the work environment. The focus to fill in so many positions has led to unnecessarily excessive external hiring in important positions. Leading to toxic leadership and decrease in retention due to overlooked hard working employee's. Moreover leadership themselves gets treated like garbage which projects on the staff who projects it on the customer. Balance both customer and employee relationships or continuing to not will be a problem that will backfire very soon.
good,"Ran a cable television route. Repaired and replaced cable lines to the customers home. Being on the outside, working on your own,was a plus.Learned to work on low voltage lines. Working with the public could be a rewarding experience."
good,"the culture in the call center was draining. As a leader it was constant change for no reason. team switches, seemed like a new drop everything focus on a daily basis. Also HR was a joke when it came to penalizing agents, they are too worried about their attrition rate to actually hold any agents accountable. Not to mention FMLA & LOA claims are out of control. Example I had a team of 15 agents 7 of them had some type of approved claim that allowed for them to miss 3-4 days per week if they needed. Also company policy sometimes handcuffs the ability of front line agents and leaders. they state policy, however do nothing to the 3rd party outsource partners who break policy. That just leads to agents and sups alike to feel the wrath of customers when we follow the policy. As long as money kept following the concerns at agent/leader level were ignored by corporate."
good,i loved this job but the goals set for employees are becoming more and more unrealistic. the distance between jobs and the time frames given are crazy. customers are a hit or miss.my issue with this company is going the extra mile is taken for graded with no compensation because of the constant change to how business is handled.but the breakfast is good
good,"Comcast is mostly a good company to work for and has great  benefits that start the day you start working. However, this can be a stressful job and  the pay is a not very competitive for this area."
good,"The people you work for are awesome for the most part, but senior management on a corporate level seem to be lacking in the actuality department. The plans they put into place are not optimized for the employees and customer experience. The systems we use are WAY out dated and constantly have issues. Sales goals are usually way off base, and not realistic with the customer base. Hourly pay pales in comparison to similar positions near me. Starting pay for my area is $10.67/hr plus commission, while our local competitors par an average of $15+ hourly in addition to commission. I have been with the company for 3+ years and have gotten outstanding on all my yearly reviews and I only make $11.39 an hour. The company does offer 401k matching up to 6% as well as a good amount of time off. Discounted courtesy services for its employees."
good,"Inbound sales is a pretty good job if you love selling anything over the phone. They pay is great and benefits even better. The only thing is that management can be stressful when goals are not met, even when they know is not the employee's fault."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, until they made changes. close my job and gave me the option to go to sales."
good,"Benefits to working were free services (Internet, TV, phone, discounted Home Automation), health care benefits, Retirement plans. However, you couldn't go anywhere. You were stuck in your position unless someone higher up left the company. There was no room to grow. It also became solely about selling products without taking into account we were also doing limited tech support for customers, and swapping out equipment (which was most often the case of a customer coming into the office). You also had to worry about phone salesman stealing your sales you worked hard for."
good,"I spent too many hours working knocking doors until 9 pm. I did not feel safe in many areas I was sent. I had one area that was very nice and the neighborhood was safe for walking around late, the others were not."
good,"During my time there I worked with some very intelligent people who, given an opportunity, could solve some very intricate problems.  They maintain a decent work-life balance, providing some remote work options.  Compensation is average at best if you look at strict dollar amounts, but when you roll in other benefits it does work itself out."
good,"Management has a hard time dealing with moral. The department I worked in rated lowest on internal surveys by employees. Instead of trying to understand why or make positive changes, they closed the department and outsourced the work."
good,My main issue was work/life balance. Having split days off can make it difficult. There's not much flexibility is changing your days off once they've been selected.
good,"The benefits with Comcast are some of the best I've ever had.  However, working retail is never a great work life balance.   The hours are long and again its retail."
good,"Job security was not great, and quota was too exigible. the environment was fun because accessories that the company provided for its employees. I would like to work for them again."
good,Longevity Comcast has no place for you to have longevity at this company so getting and make your money and get out because they will terminate you once you make a certain amount of years
good,Very tedious work and you are micromanaged. Stressful and loud environment. No longer a fun place to work. It’s almost like being in prison. The benefits are good.
good,"It was a place I would have stayed at, if not for having to leave for personal reasons. Pay increases were not great but what company isn't more concerned about there bottom line, than the employees' work/pay ratio?"
good,"Lots of opportunity if willing to relocate."
good,Benefits are great.  Poor management but a perfect place if you just want to do your task and hand.  Once you are in you are in and the benefits are great.
good,The only enjoyable part of the job was able to help people out setting up their account and showing the newest features on the cable box or rolling out cell phone services.
good,"Pay should be higher for the work you do. "
good,"Comcast has a lot to offer at both the market level and national level, however moving around within is a bit of a challenge.  While Comcast focus's our goals around  customer experience and reliable delivery, we lack good employee goals to drive career growth and success.  If you like constant change, deal well with high stress and enjoy being in a fast stream, Comcast is right for you!"
good,The company provided good benefits from free cable to reasonable healthcare.  Annual bonuses and stock options were a plus.  Promotions were based more on who you know vs. what you know/accomplished.
good,"great company to work for, great benefits, management need to be improved, workplace is cool, game tables in lunch room, hardest part of job is monthly goal"
good,My department wouldn't let me work part time because of the management. They would rather lose a worker than accommodating. I worked with many friends but many felt we were not compensated fairly for the work we were doing.
good,As with any company change is  part of the business. Sometimes change works out well and sometimes not so much. I wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.
good,HR is a screaming nightmare and they will do anything to discredit hard working employees. Rude to say the least. I hope they have fixed this issue with people who actually care.
good,comcast has great benefits for part time and full time. retail stores are unorganized due to improper training. most employees get terminated by people who got understand Comcast system their self.
good,Comcast has very good benefits. Work life balance can be very bad depending on the team or department you are in. Once you have entered into the company you may find it hard to leave out of your area due to lack of employee growth outside of call center work.
good,"great benefits.  Good coworkers.  Very accepting of everyone.  "
good,"Comcast is the leading provider for Cable and Home Entertainment. They have a great mission and values, and they thrive to succeed in the entertainment field."
good,"Management is value, however, far less than frontline."
good,I've been with Comcast for a while now and it's been a good company to work for the most part. They tend to show favoritism for those they want to promote. Very few minorities in management positions
good,"Working at Comcast requires engagement in a wide variety of tasks, but we also make sure that our team-members are cross-trained & are able/willing to provide support for one another. Shifting priorities is at the core of my team's successful completion of tasks during the busy times. Overall environment is very supportive & stress free."
good,"based on which department your are hired for the worlds of Comcast can be extremely different. As a technician, I was happy for the most part. As part of the marketing team I was expendable overworked but at least fairly compensated."
good,Comcast is a good company to work for. The department I was in could work on management skills and how to treat employees fairly. The job was very easy. Comcast needs to make to easier for advancement within the company. My management didn't know how to handle conflict in the department which caused much tension in the working environment.
good,"Comcast was a great place to be/work, unfortunately I was fired due to a legal issue I was undergoing so I didn't have a lot of time to spend there all I can say for the short time I was employed if it wasn't for the legal issue id still be working there with no issues"
good,"Comcast is a decent place to work but not for a career. As a technician they do not provide much job growth but job security is there. On a scale of 1-10, 6 is where I would rate the overall culture"
good,The job isn’t hard and it can be very enjoyable if you want that for your life. Some people love what they do and some don’t. The job isn’t a bad job the environment is pretty chill for a major company but it’s very stressful as well.
good,"High tempo job, required a lot of physical activity. Good Management, benefits ok. Good employees. Very customer focused, would work there again in different postion"
good,"Overall, it's a good place to work for.  As long as your making your numbers. Great people from all backgrounds and diversities. They provide all types of training so your constantly learning."
good,Decent work place would not recommend if you have/need a flexible schedule. Overall experience was great but the company refused to work with my schedule of wanting a part-time shift
good,"if you don't have tough skin thighs job is hot for you,  if you're not a prime person this job is not for you and if your not fluent in sales you will not succeed."
good,"Most of the people I worked with were awesome, but our managers were marginal at best. If you like to kiss up to move up, this is the perfect job for you."
good,Diverse place to & weekly fun activities for employees also great benefits. Fast paced environment . Not a lot of advancement opportunities but competitive pay.
good,"I enjoyed working for Comcast, the only reason I left was because I relocated to another area.The benefits are great and in general the leadership is good and cares about their employees."
good,"On the surface the position is billed as a technical support position where you'll be helping people fix their television service. The majority of what you are judged on, however, is how quickly you'll be able to get people to accept that their appointment isn't happening when they thought it was while up-selling them as much as possible. The benefits are great for the most part and the environment is upbeat but this is a SALES job with the technical parts deferred to a script. The training was more about believing in the company and knowing the product enough to sell it more than dealing with the wave of angry customers. The escalation process was lack-luster and often insufficient as I had management often refuse to respond in a timely manner (if at all sometimes) and still not be helpful while your times skyrocket."
good,Too many managers.involved in daily decisions which should be made by the employee. They treat contractors different than they do full time employees.
good,"I worked at Comcast during a re-organizational period. A lot about day to day tasks and functions were being figured out during my time there and it was difficult to meet expectations. There wasn't much of a work/life balance or appreciation for my hard working team. The employees here are amazing people to work with, but the office culture is a bit of a downer"
good,"Going to peoples houses means your day is never dull. Every house is a new adventure. "
good,Comcast has exceptional perks and benefits for its employees . The company really invests in its people when it comes to providing great benefits and flexibility
good,"stressful job for metrics "
good,"well you have to do ,a lot and customer don't know that when your there you only have a little time frame for the job ,they keep squeezing job on your rout and you have to keep the customers happy for 30 days and beg them not to call for any reason and just call you,and"
good,"As a communication technician, it was good to work along with a route, meeting new people, and managing my own work, but the job was physically and mentally demanding."
good,"While the pay and benefits for this company where wonderful. The environment created by the culture was very toxic. One was always looking over ones shoulder waiting to get fired or waiting for the other foot to fall. "
good,"Loved the people I worked with, Great atmosphere for the most part, difficult part is that this was always changing and sometimes you had no idea why but you just went with it."
good,The benefits were amazing and the money was good. Severence package was good. No notice on eliminating the direct sales department. I would like to go back and work for Comcast.
good,"Allowed some flexible working hours."
good,spent a lot of time a customer residences on hold with same call centers as customers themselves didnt want to deal with. People did not like you. hot days in attics or under houses. cold and rainy days outside and up poles.
good,"Was a great place to learn how to manage a large-scale Agile/Digital production. However, digital producers/project managers were not considered a primary candidate for any sort of advancement within the UX studio for Comcast. Nice hourly wage, but benefits and PTO and all other perks were off the table."
good,"Very stressful job with poor mangement and consistent equipment failure"
good,"No support from supervisors or managers, high-stress environment.  No support for agents who are abused on a daily basis by customers in a verbal manner."
good,"Great, fast paced job that requires good time managing skills and hard work ethic. You are well trained by company and spend a fair amount of time working on your own individual route almost like it is your own business."
good,"The demands of multitasking is overwhelming, I'm good with the requirements of the job responsibilities,  I just thing that incorporating the responsibility of what once was considered H.R. (Time keeping and reporting) is too much."
good,I definitely learned a lot about how to deal with upset customers and finding solutions for them. Comcast benefits are amazing. The pay is one of the biggest issues considering the work load. They are constantly changing the commission structure which affects the pay negatively.
good,The company took care of employees when it came to family emergencies. Work was stressful a lot of the time and the harder you worked the more work you got
good,This job has to do more than it sets out for with that being said you're not really recognized for this and pay or through coaching's with supervisor who some of them don't actually understand some of what you do because if they have just came in asked revises they haven't actually taking calls and this results in front-line employees actually no one more than our own devices also seems as though when having calls that are escalated they don't really want to take them like they're supposed to we get told were valued at we fix things when we tell our superiors nothing really changes they just tell us what else to do or say on a call to make things better but that's not what is needed we have started metric to happen that which sometimes are affected by our systems being down and not working but yet we're still told to work through them when they're crucial and needed for us to get our job done overall the job ends up becoming not really worth the pay
good,"Constant change. Launch new products and expect the same amount of time to complete. Micro-managed, learned alot about how cable works and also, how technology advances very fast."
good,This is a ok company to work for. They do have a high turn over in the company. I feel that Comcast Sales Dept puts a lot of pressure on you and want you to learn the knowledge at a rapid rate. Also they put on a sales list the you have called and cause the customer to become irate. Positive things about the company is the have great bonus. You can make up the time if you miss a day. Comcast give you overtime and will give you a buddy to help you with your sales. Great 401K plan and stock options. Also Comcast is great with giving you paid time off vacation and sick time a paid time off. Comcast is a grat divers company.
good,While they care about their customers verbally it is all about billing increases. They pay their front end staff about the sames as they a Whole Foods but they expect you tyo be as quick as a cat on a hot tin roof with poor tools
good,Fast paced ever changing schedule and route. There is a strong sense of teamwork among the technicians but supervisors and management are disconnected from the struggles faced on a daily basis and if you mention your concerns you are labeled as a negative influence
good,Lots of stressed customers who've already come to dislike the company and service.  Not much room for improvement or career advancement.  Offered 4 day schedules
good,"Training was the hardest part of the job"
good,"Pay and benefits are good. But be prepared for disappointment when it comes to advancement. Their Comtech training program is deceptive in that it promises slightly higher wages for a disproportionate addition of duties. Also, just because you have done the training and received the pay increase, DOES NOT mean you will move to the physical position. Many of these people are Lifers, and positions open very rarely."
good,"I thought I found my dream job, I relocated for this job! "
good,"I handled up to 7 states with customer service issues, tech support, and pending cancellations. Multiple metric gauged my progress. Had to heavily rely on training and experience due to nature of the job. Support was lacking at times. Good company but still very stressful and High turn over rate continues"
good,"with the company for over 10+ years.Over  the years job declined. fun environment sometime stressful because you wanted to make sure all metrics are being met.(sales environment) job  advancement started to be based on favoritism. Love the benefits, medical,dental, vision ,retirement 401k, and  stock option."
good,It is a very unorganized company to work for. they change the schedule on you any time and expect for you to work that schedule no matter what. the management is not a organized management/ the training structure is horrible.
good,"A typical day at Comcast was fast  paced. You were sometimes threatened to me your sales goals with losing you job. The Management was great, but the corp employees liked to stir the pot. All the employees would get along. The hardest part of the job was being asked to ""get those sales or else.""."
good,My time at Comcast wasn't that bad. Your job duties are pretty straight forward and my co-workers were cool people. Moving internally is very hard to do...this was my only issue.
good,was an ok  job very stress full at times . some people were not very supportive . supervisor was not help full. work load was challenging . but was rewording .
good,"The job was great pay. The company provided all the training and tools necessary in order to perform your job efficiently. Unfortunately due to a company wide lay off, my position was eliminated."
good,"I am motivated at my job mostly through financial rewards and wish I had more of connection with the people I work with, but because it's a desk job, I don't have the opportunity to move and mingle. I'd like to be in a position that also gives me a chance to make a difference in other peoples lives and not just receive financial rewards."
good,"Not a great place for a female technician. Even though I enjoyed working alone most of the time, it was difficult dealing with unwanted advancements from co-workers as well as customers."
good,high call volume mostly customer complaints / learned patience / management seemed not to be empathetic to employees/ diversity in the workplace/ escalations and the feeling of being unprepared due to not enough training and knowing that scorecards as it relates to job performance seemed unfair is the hardest part of the job/ most enjoyable part of the job was peer team work and getting off
good,"Went in for part time had to work full time hours due to lack of employees. High turnaround. You never leave on time (2 hours later usually if you don't run into any problems). Management is on top of you ALL the time. Difficult to get breaks and when you're on them you'll, passively aggressively get asked about it. Not for the faint of heart."
good,"Comcast provides great benefits and a considerable discount on in-home services.  At this company it's who you know and not what you know.  There is a lack in training/coaching and management isn't very productive or friendly.  Employees work themselves to the bone without any real recognition or appreciation.  Job security used to exist but from personal experience, that's no longer the case."
good,"I learn a lot it's very competitive , just like with any job there's some great leader and some bad leader also overall great place to work the most important is the agents and your fellow supervisor you work with on a day to day ."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the constant hate you will get from the customers. They will blame you for issues that poor infrastructure maintenance has caused and your sup will tell you to bend over and take it. The company will pay you more than you deserve for sitting in an air conditioned building with a internet enabled computer you can browse during slow times, but doing the same thing every day and dealing with the same hate filled customers will slowly wear down even the most optimistic doe eyed agents. The best part about working here are the Benefits. 6% match on a 401k will quickly grow into a very nice next egg. Discounted Stock purchase plan. Great health care."
good,"it's a call center job.  not good, not bad."
good,"I found Comcast was a good place to work, in certain areas. I had a chance to travel with Comcast and observed only one area that lacks in management - Jackson, MS. Days were long as some days extended past your normal working hours, but benefits were good. The Jackson area did not have a HR rep for years which caused morale to be low, because you did not have someone to help when needed. Individuals here were promoted based on favorable mentions instead of performance. I personally observed terminations of good performing people, and retention of the lowest performing people. Overall Comcast is good, better if new management is hired."
good,Time definitely soared by while working at Comcast but the stress that was involved was kind of to much for me.  Tying it with what I already had going on at home was mind-blowing.
good,"Depending on the department you have no job security. I love my coworkers. Management could do a better job in recognizing their employees, communicationa and assist with job advancement."
good,"I work for retention, which is a disconnection department, but we have to meet sales metrics. Pay is decent, is there was no commission I wouldn't think twice about quitting. Metrics and customer make job extremely stressful. Commission is okay, but we should make much more than we do. Benefits and cable discounts are amazing. It is a good company to work for, but there are a lot of things that could be changed to make the company better and the jon less stressful."
good,"positively-one of a few organizations that you can get employed and start, without a $100000 4 year degree, and with effort, conscientious career minded approach, create a comfortable middle class income.  Which is huge in this economy "
good,very stressful place to work at some supervisors really care others just there no help management has u walking around on egg shells team member were great the pay structure changes to much
good,"beware of how the numbers game means everything even if your job performance suffers"
good,Changes are a every month thing expect to be told something new because nothing is consistent with this company. This is all that I have to say about this company................
good,There was a time I thought this might be a good job bu to have to sell to people who are just calling in to get their cable fixed was to much and the main reason for leaving.
good,"The company is closing the office in Oakbrook, IL, this is effective October 30th of this year. During my time with Comcast many of the supervisors would work to resolve any customer related issues.  By trying to maintain a high level of customer retention while maintaining company profits."
good,Company did not have its act together. You were frequently asked to give customers info that was not true. Management was frequently unable to help you. Upper lever management was even worse. You were frequently pushed to work faster even though that was impossible many times.
good,It was my first time in a sales position. I dont agree with some of the techniques they use in order to hit goals. The employees are really nice and caring.
good,"Great work/life balance, career advancement opportunities extremely difficult.Great benefits, relaxed working environment. This is a very fast pace job that requires much focus.The hardest part of the job is the fact that you have customers yelling, screaming and cursing you out daily , this is a technical support environment, therefore, the majority of the customers that are calling in are having issues with their phone, internet, or cable tv service, sometimes all 3."
good,"Good Career but unfortunately pay rate is too low. For everything that you have to do, we should be compensated alot more. Our counterparts Verizon, get paid almost double the amount we do."
good,"It is one thing to have a million hoops to jump through, which they do make easy in most cases, however, if you get injured and need to be out for more than a few weeks, you might as well kiss your job good bye.  They like to fire you by mail, and call it Voluntary Quitting because you couldn't get to work."
good,In house co-workers always fun to be around. metrics set by company sometimes are not achievable. company trend seems to be after level 4 technician and topped out pay. Company tries to get rid of you. to let someone less experienced do the same job for less money.
good,"My experience at Comcast was pretty good over all.  The management and do as I say not as I do was a bit challenging over the years.  Leaders seemed to all be over worked and overwhelmed with work load.  Endless meetings with little to no benefit or emphasis on time management from leadership while facilitating courses also became very challenging.  I loved the actual work, and partnerships I had with many of my peers as well as business partners."
good,I had a work at home job with convery which was a contractor for comcast. The pay was not that great but  I did get to work from home. Comcast has alot of unhappy customers.
good,Comcast has good compensation/benefits packages but the hrs are poorly divided and the metrics are inconsistent which provides a fickle feedback loop.
good,"They have great break rooms, and accommodations for their employees. You also get excellent discounts on cable, internet and telephone services. You just want to work in the right department."
good,"Negative customer experience, poor reputation with their customer base on service and product. Poor communication or lack of communicating to their customer on service affecting outages."
good,some of my daily duties at Comcast are I am 1 out of 3 people that are in charge of the cash and the safe and making sure the paper work is correct from the night before. I also make sure the cash bags match everything before garda comes to pick up the money on a daily basis. I deal with escalated customers helping resolve the billing questions or services providing the best customer services making sure they leave happy.
good,"Stressful, maddening work pace, hostile, competitive work environment with poorly trained managers.  Poor quality in job security and advancement.  Poor training standards and very strict and unjust evaluation system."
good,"I work on a great team with peers who exemplify what it means to be ""all hands on deck"" when needed.  Attention to detail is very important and having the ability to multitask is very crucial."
good,"Mixed review due to several factors.  The pay is comparable, especially with commissions and bonuses on top of competitive hourly or salaried wages.  Worst customer service in the world!!!  Very disfunctional management.  The worst thing is the hours keep changing due to unnecessary shift bids which occur every 3-6 months.  This routinely leads to resignations and firings due to employees not being able to work their new schedules assigned in the shift bids..."
good,"Working for the company overall has been rewarding, there have been intensely stressful moments that seem to be happening more frequently. "
good,Management preaches that they are about family and that they understand that things happen. But when it comes down to it they do not care at all. Management puts themselves above everyone else. I learned alot about customers and the cable company works. My co-workers are awesome and we all provide support for each other. The hardest part of the job would be the csg system which does not function properly on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers and customers.
good,The environment was fast paced and sales orientated. You had to close sales to make commission.You can make a good living for a short while but for long term you would need to be in management.
good,"If you live in the Springs, there is one cable store which makes it very difficult to move upwards. Feedback is sparse and usually very generic. The company is largely centered in Denver if you are looking for more opportunity. But the pay is second to none for retail."
good,typical work day is fixing customers issues.  I learned patience and the ability to relate with your customers to give the best experience possible.  The workplace culture is ok. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee and the challenge to reach your goals
good,Proceedures changing too often.  In sales dept. goals are usually un-obtainable.  Hours change and managers not concerned that much with employees.  Too much record keeping and a fair amount of micro-managing.
good,"comcast was a fun place to work and gave me the start in telecommunications. the techs and employees were cool. if you are not ready to respresent a brand, then this is not the place for you."
good,"A typical day would involve problems between departments. Always expecting materials to be there no matter what, no teamwork"
good,What they don't tell you when applying for the job that you are also suppose try to upsell someone only time you don't if their services are out or if they have all the services. The office team i worked for is very drama drivien and clique
good,"I have worked for Comcast for 4 years now.   I love my coworkers, and some of the supervisors with the company.  Comcast does provide good benefits,but when it comes to promotions they fall very short of the mark.  There are promises made for career advance, but when you are submitted for career advance they will use everything they can to keep you from prompting upwards. Last promotion time they only allowed 2 people to promote up despite the fact that upwards of 10 were submitted for promotion."
good,"Comcast Spotlight focus is more on Sales than on administrative duties."
good,The company is overall a good company. The service is not built out to all cities and location making it challenging to provide service in a timely manner to potential customers. The process to get an order through is timely. To many people having control of a sales order.
good,"during the early months it was ok, then they slowly became a pilot program no one knows what they are doing. I felt like it was unorganized and not yet grounded. located at 1500 market st philly. other jobs at the JFK location were better and got more perks. "
good,"good place to work. overall benefits are really good compared to other same like companies. Life and work balance is a struggle."
good,"Going to work coming home is the best part of this job and enjoying the benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job. workplace culture. management, a typical day at work"
good,"As a very large company, there were many benefits, but there were also many drawbacks due to the enormous amount of employees. Most times I felt I was just a number to management and could be let go at when budgets were re-evaluated. The health and vacation benefits were excellent."
good,"Great pay and benefits, however lack of leadership at the (Woodridge, IL) location. Poor management and poor communication is what made some aspects of the environment difficult. High turn over was a sign of initial decline. Overall great company, just minor adjustment internally with some locations."
good,the culture of Comcast is working together to win together.  I take pride in what I do for an organization and it is important to feel that I add value.  At Comcast you can be a contributor and you will feel like you are part of the team.
good,Quality place to work with a well rounded team.  Provides the best in telecommunication products for the end consumer.  Comcast provides ample opportunity for advancement into senior level leadership positions for those who qualify.
good,"Working for Comcast makes you feel like you are a cog in a giant machine.  It is hard to effect meaningful change and as a a member of management if was hard to hold employees accountable.  It was next to impossible to let people go for poor performance but members of management were let go constantly for their teams performance.  "
good,A typical day would be to very quickly start taking calls or making calls to customer from que. work with customer to find and resolve simple to complex issues. very high pressure and high stress.
good,"A typical day is very fast paced. Signed on for a Customer Service Billing position, a lot of pressure was put on you to generate sales.  A lot of disgruntled customers who I believe were being overcharged for their services. On the plus side my coworkers and the managers were good people who tried to make the work environment a fun place.  However it was just too stressful."
good,"the jobs its self is cool you have to create your own business, and build a clientele, the environment can be fun but sales can be down at goals are set high at time to where they seem unable to meet"
good,"The environment provides excellent benefits and the employee stock option plan is a bonus.  However, the current company policies and practices do not lend to an effective job work/life balance."
good,I love and miss my work family. At times job functions changed then changed back keeping long term employees off balance. The support of my fellow front line employees kept me there.
good,Good entry-level job to get some mechanical and technical skills. Teamwork is expected to get the job done. Management is not great because of how big the company is.
good,i choose not put any reviews in this. I do not want to write any thing. I would rather use the stars and this is it. please do not force to use the review
good,"Company does not have a good work/life balance.  Pays well, but you work long hours with no recognition.  I am beginning to realize there is more to life then free cable."
good,"Answered call from customers via telephony, email, and instant message. Provided technical support for phone and internet customers. Trouble shooting and quality assusrance."
good,Worked with great people. Comcast has an excellent product when it works. Dealt with a lot of angry customers. Comcast says they are making strides to improve their Customer Service but still fall short in achieving this. No set schedule or hours makes a work life balance difficult
good,"Comcast is a good place to work as a first job out of college. They have great benefit packages but the job could be very stressful. It can be very difficult to balance the needs of the customer and the company while still meeting your NUMBERS. "
good,"Fast paced, quantitative close sales culture. Strict time standards for breaks, time on the phone, number of calls, number of minutes on calls and between call."
good,"Check in and then head to the filed. Basic sales skills repeated often. Management ok, seem more concerned with keeping their job rather than doing their job. Sales environment. Dealing with weather and the public most difficult part of job. Perks."
good,"There are pro and con with all companies. However, understanding the great things within the company and yourself bridges the balance of your outlook and theirs. Character and integrity is balance and if you hold these two the company becomes you."
good,overall it was a good job just got old fast and room for growth is talked about but is not as easy as you would think. If you are patient you can move up and make a career out of this position.
good,Company is ok if you have no family an looking to move up in 6 years under paid over work .customers have attitudes. Have to maintain so much rewarded very little
good,"Comcast overall was a decent experience, but lacks camaraderie, management, and quality assurance. The benefits had much to offer, however in my opinion the job itself does not pay well enough for the level of responsibility of new technicians. Sub-par training, lack of tools and proper equipment, as well as unreachable supervisors often lead to a very unproductive work day."
good,"Overall, Comcast is a good company to work for!  The company seeks to improve employee engagement however, in the call center the attrition rate is very high due to a large amount of stress."
good,"ok  place to work as far as benifits but the pay was below competitors . not really much room for growth since the management "
good,"dont care to comment, very stressful environment there is no respect for the employees they are treated horrible by callers with no help from management"
good,"Company offers excellent benefits and great compensation package."
good,"Comcast as a company overall , I do not recommend this company. I did enjoy working there at times. What I did not like about Comcast is that when a customer calls in to get a problem fixed, us as employees never solved the actual problem, we did what we had to do right then and there to fix the problem but it was never really fixed because the customer would call in about the same thing a week later."
good,The environment here was terrible - they just try and throw money at problems. When things dont work out just blame the consultants you brought on and hire more and let it cycle over again.
good,"Working at Comcast has amazing company perks for television, internet and telephone, a big discount. however the hourly pay could be much better for the work that is done."
good,The Call Center I worked in was very fun to be apart of. There were always different events going on for reps and the company would typically provide lunch every Friday.
good,"I was a customer with Comcast for 10 yrs prior to applying. I never had any issues & thought it would be fun. I was hired with in 2 weeks of filling out my online application. I went to 3 interviews & they started paying me time & a half while training bc we can't make commission. That was awesome!! The first location I worked at, my manager (who picked me) starting treating me awful & even though I was hired part time, I was threatened my job for not being available to work 40 hrs. After reporting it to the district mgr., I was able to transfer to another location closer to my house. That's were I wanted to be anyway. There was a lady there that had been there for 30 yrs & she immediately judged me. I had a hard time getting friendliness from anyone but my new mgr. over time, ppl started treating me better but not the older woman. Her & our new asst mgr worked against me & behind my mgrs back. It led to me getting fired. I was so upset but then my manager didn't say anything to have my back. My experience is that there's no ""team"" unless you're part of the ""click"" inside sales centers. I was always made to feel like I wasn't good enough. It went from being critiqued to harassment. I would recommend the call centers or check out your local locations & see how the staff are first."
good,"Working for tech support advanced services was an adventure, the office was great people were fun, the job itself was constricting and micro managed. You are stuck in your desk answering call after call on tech support line now while this is a rewarding position at times it just gets very mundane long term. The management really decide favoritism within the office and the goals and advancement really seem to put you in no direct path to  advance. It is a great place to learn and start out but long term not so much for advancement."
good,"Unfortunately I  do not have an opinion in reference to Comcast, about it's employee and the job and management in itself."
good,overall I did not like working here... money wasn't great... co-workers were nice but the turn-over rate was ridiculous. people were getting fired left and right.
good,"high turnover rate do to productivity by techs. Plant integrity is bad., so tech numbers are always bad. Responsible for a lot with little pay. Best service out of all cable/internet competitors., but least pay out of all our competitors. If Comcast can up the pay sale it will be a okay environment."
good,"My local office was an awesome place to work. Vast majority of team cares about our customers, within company and customers who use our services. What made it work so well is everybody's willingness to share best common practices."
good,"Comcast constantly changes. If you are starting out this is a good job. Most of the supervisors have checked out, and are there just biding their time."
good,"co-workers were what made day to day worth it.  decisions seemed to be made without employee involvement, so it made it difficult for buy in."
good,"Demanding, expected to work long hours but if you succeed there are countless opportunities. Management is supportive of career development."
good,There was little to no direction.  A responsibility creep between Denver team and East coast team.  Micromanagement was also an issue.  Good opportunity for advancement if you can get on the internal team.
good,"Unfortunately after 5-7 years with the company, growth becomes static.  They do, however, offer many means of receiving education to advance your career in other directions."
good,"Same work all day basically standing in the same spot for 8 hours so if you do not mind that then it isn't that bad. I learned how too operate different machines over time. My co-workers were friendly. There wasn't much of a hard job, I enjoyed most because i'm a hard worker."
good,"Management is overworked and exhausted. Co-workers are friendly and cheerful. Mostly a cheerful place to work, but they will drop you in a moment if you make a mistake. Hardest part is trying to stay focused with all of the many things that need to be done."
good,Honestly not a bad company to work for. the only negative experiences i have had are with the attendance policies. also a big issue across the company is management. Half of the time they cant agree on a policy or either dont know it. other times they are never available to help. lastly they will not defend you in front of cx or management
good,"I was a Temp employee, My contract expire, that was the reason that I left   Company was going through a merge with Xfinity.  I didn't want to stay there for a long time."
good,"I have worked for Comcast almost 9 years, the work life balance is something to be desired. The pay, benefits, and overall compensation are stellar however management doesn't really care about the individual. There is a lot of micro management and stress placed on the employee. It is extremely difficult to progress or move around to different types of jobs when you are an internal employee."
good,Comcast had a lot of things going for it but; they don't have really strong leadership in place to help get things done. They bring a lot of out side people in that have no knowledge of that job role which make it really hard to follow their lead.
good,Amazing coworkers and great team ethics. Some Supervisors and Managers actually aware of whats going on inside the company in terms of services and procedures. Short breaks and short lunch can drag days along and cause for a bland work environment. Company has policies that are becoming stale and need to change if they want to continue to grow.
good,Door to Door Sales.  A lot of training in classroom environment.  I did not receive any after that.  The job was about volume.  How many doors could you knock.  The law of averages was in your favor.
good,Comcast is a good company but the management is lacking plus slow advancement in the company makes for poor morale. I still appreciate the opportunity
good,"Working in the Web Department was very enjoyable. Co-workers are very down to earth and willing to help when asked. Learning the sales process was difficult since it was always changing, but it was a good stepping stone to a better job."
good,"I was gladly challenged selling advertising to 'Ma and Pa' businesses. "
good,Answer incoming phone calls giving customer support for billing and account information. Troubleshoot all aspects of video internet and phone issues. Management tries their best to be supportive and accommodating.  Get to solve a myriad  of issues on a daily basis
good,"The hours are long, expectations a bit unrealistic due to varying skill levels. You have your workers who aren't that great but can knock out a lot of jobs, or the truly knowledgeable workers who don't have enough time to get everything done properly and up-to-code."
good,"It's a good place to work as long as there's communication.  Otherwise you're left in the dark."
good,I like working at comcast. I like my co-workers we work as a team. Every day is a learning experience. I enjoy helping out my customers and fixing there problems.
good,"A typical work day depending on your shift involves rude people directing frustration at you directly while trying to remain positive while also trying to hit all points on a call script while trying to up-sell every call for increased revenue. "
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for.  The product that is offered ranks among the best.  They really do have the customer's best interest at heart."
good,"Solve billing issues, escalations, set appointment for installation. Trouble shoot the services from cable, internet and telephone. Assist Supervisor with reports for training of the new hires. Management took into consideration of our ideas and problem solving techniques that assist customers so it will build loyalty and reduce customer churn. "
good,"Comcast was a very friendly work place, they allow you to be yourself. A very tattoo and piercing acceptable place. The short time I was there was enjoyable and the work was not hard at all, you just have to have a very good memory for that type of work."
good,"Very stressful job."
good,"Comcast runs typical to an oiled machine. We clocked in, performed scheduled duties, attended scheduled trainings and clocked out. While the hiring powers promote room for advancement, it is rare. Typically you will meet agents that have been in their roles for over 15 years. As a phone agent you can take a pretty brutal beating from customers, however there are some amazing supervisors that take time to get to know their staff and help develop and coach their agents accordingly."
good,"Comcast was an interesting and complex place to work, from dealing with the wide range customer base, to dealing with the internal channels to complete daily job tasks."
good,"My time at Comcast was brief because it was extremely difficult to earn money due to the fact it was commission only, However working with my coworkers was enjoyable."
good,A typical day as a collections specialist starts on the phones and is already stressful enough due to consumers being agitated about their accounts being closed. Compound that with micro-management and a lack of empathy from those in power it can be a challenging workplace. The most enjoyable part of the day is providing customers willing to work with their debt an outlet and way out of their situation.
good,I love going to work and being able to help others.its a very great company to work for with great benefits.the shifts bids  are a little unfortunate sometimes but you can manage it
good,Typical starts with arriving to scheduled appointments for repairs or new installations with comcast products. Drive a work van to these schedule appointments.
good,"A lot of good things about working at Comcast along with a lot of things that go along with firms that have grown by acquisition. There are some very good people who work at Comcast.  There is also a lot of castle building.  Advancement truly depends on who you know or via the FUMU paradigm.  If you're good at what you do and are effectively supporting your management and making them look good, unless you know someone, expect to be in the same place for many years.  Benefits are good and include a lot of things you will probably never use.  It's a political environment; so watch your step.  Pay is so-so and seems to be depressed because of the HUGE number of H1Bs on the dole.  Comcast is probably a very good place to begin or end a career.  But for those who strive for making a difference and advancing their careers in meaningful ways, Comcast is probably not a great place for you."
good,"Unless you are in customer service, Comcast may not want to continue employment due to demands of business."
good,"A typical day at work would start with attending a team meeting with manager, then prepare and research on the businesses in my assigned territory. Most of the afternoon would be spent in the field going to businesses introducing myself and recommending services and products according to customers' needs. After taking customers'  order, the end of my work day would consists of finishing my paperwork back at the office."
good,for a large company very poorly run seem to fly off the seat of their pants and there is no consistency Lots of turnover lacks mid mgm and change sales weekly very little consistancy
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping set up new services for new customers, challenging myself to make each sell a ""triple Play,"" TV, phone, and internet sale..."
good,It is a good job with good benefits but not a lot of room to move up. Would not be a bad career if there were more room to move up.
good,"A typical day consists of a 10 hour day dealing with residential customers. Installing and servicing cable TV, internet and phone services. Over 10 years I learned alot about time management, customer service and advanced technologies and trouble shooting skills. The hardest part of the job was climbing poles in bad weather. The best was the fellow employees I worked with and meeting some very interesting customers."
good,I enjoyed working at Comcast.  I was hired on from coming from a temp agency.  There were a lot of us trying to get the position and things worked out for me great.  The hours and people were nice and I the perks of working there were excellent!
good,Available upon request. Great place to learn and grow your career. It is a very high paced environment where change is always relevant.
good,"Comcast brings together the best in media and technology. We drive innovation to create the world's best entertainment and online experiences. As a Fortune 50 leader, we set the pace in a variety of innovative and fascinating businesses and create career opportunities across a wide range of locations and disciplines. We are at the forefront of change and move at an amazing pace, thanks to our remarkable people, who bring cutting-edge products and services to life for millions of customers every day."
good,Good place to work with advancement in customer care and technology with cutting edged technology. Very in tune with employee needs and develops programs to enhance the lives of their employees.
good,"You will always be busy, there is not a lot of down time. Met and exceed customer experience and sales quotas, helped determine the overall daily operations of a store. Train new employees, and assisted customers to ensure an extraordinary customer experience, cost efficiency, and quality store operations. Maintain inventories at adequate levels, promote sales, and maintained the appearance of the store. Completed accounting and paperwork associated with cash receipts, prices and helped with physical inventory. Helped managing store opportunities, customer satisfaction, audit scores, and other criteria asked of me."
good,I  had some problems with management and the managers manager. I did not feel happy working there after 5 years. I was always being told how I cold lose my job but never was told how to better myself.
good,The most important element of my job is the people. The team is important part that has help to make the job overall experience a joy. I have learned what was needing to make the person I am today.
good,Not a bad job just was not properly informed of how high the call volume is. I started out in a new position that was recently created and since starting the position it seems as if more and more worked was given to us. Our call volume tripled overnight as new markets were taken in by Comcast and it can be stressful at times. Overall it is a good positon to have and does provide opportunities for advancement with great benefits you just have to be prepared to take constant back to back calls.
good,Not a great company to work for.  They are more concerned with sells than customers. Always seem to be increasing goals and revenue but not focused on customer issues and complaints.
good,"Operationally Comcast is very immature and antiquated.  Coming from a company that was very customer oriented and technologically advanced it has been a challenge making an adjustment.  "
good,"I process, revise, optimize online orders for Account Executives that run across multiple online platforms."
good,"hard to advance, learn more in field than from training, every year benefits prices went up and coverage went down not a bad company"
good,It is a very productive culture to work within because of the team environment and knowledgeable management. Working in databases processes can be repetitive.  There is a lot of work that keeps the company strong.
good,"The supervisors vary greatly in their approach to emlpoyee needs and daily communications with team members. Overall management tries to keep environment postive in an otherwise negative job. Job consisted mostly of answering customer calls for service repair. Many customers are very unhappy when they call in. I was able to de-escalate my customers very well, they felt valued as a Comcast customer. Comcast is not very flexible with scheduling which can be anytime between 6 am and 12 midnight. Other jobs I have worked at Comcast are paid competitively and schedules are consistant. Call center has high turn over of employees, and very little opportunity for advancement. Salary in the call center position is low compared to similar companies with similar work. Overall, the best thing about working in Comcast's call center is the comradery between co-workers. There are people of all ethnicities, race, and orientation. They make the job much more fun!"
good,There were slow days and other days that was extremely busy. I've learned sales pro which really benefited the company and staff. Management has its up and downs but most managers are very nice. The hardest part of the job is being a time frame for each call but have a lot of system errors that never get resolved. The most enjoyable is the perks and incentives we receive.
good,"o	Communicate with customers in order to respond to billing questions, resolve service concerns, provide rate and programming information."
good,"Comcast is growing in the cable industry and advance technolog, but does not appear research and development is successfully executed in all market areas to provide Customer satisfaction and prevent major downtime in different area as it relates to climate and largely populated areas and this is causing major negative reports from the company consumers."
good,"While the benefits are very good, the culture of the place isn't good. You're given a false hope of growth and success. Many of the companies ways  aren't ethical. At some points you feel as if your being set up for failure. "
good,"Worked as a contractor on a 6 month assignment, got extended to a year and a half. Great team, great atmosphere. Lots of times we got to go out to lunch or baseballs games."
good,"•	Answered patient inquiries about billing, procedures, policies and available services."
good,"Day to day was going into the office to set up meetings with customers to sell them on Xfinity product."
good,typical day at work entails reading emails which provide any updates on customer services also taking calls from customers and providing excellent service to retain their business.
good,"I would go to work everyday on Marta, arrive early enough to play a few games of pool, have a 15-30 minute Pre-shift with my team (Which is a motivational meeting before the shift to get the teams excited about hoping on the phones to make sales!). As I make calls to sale Comcast I try to assist all of our loyal customers with minor issues I could solve. Management would encourage me to not focus too much on Customer Service issues because they had a separate department assigned to that, however I managed to do what i could to help the customer as much as possible. That's how I became the team's top salesman, also promoted to Team Lead!"
good,"Comcast has a good employee training program, an excellent time off policy that is liberal to say the least. That said compensation is low for the amount of work that is done and the work environment can be challenging to say the least."
good,Comcast is a great company to work for its very fast pace and highly stressful at times. I took from 100 to 150 calls a day. benefits was awesome and going to work meeting new people was wonderful.
good,"Company is very results driven. If you do not meet quota they will get rid of you without training to assist you to better your skills!"
good,"Reviewed intake of trouble calls from previous day, looking for any patterns to identify any on going issues that may not have been identified yet. Spoke with irate customers and worked on solutions to their problems in a timely manner. Worked on schedules and preplanned for any upcoming events or promotions."
good,"The Company provides great benefits (Free cable, internet, phone and alarm, Company vehicles for Techs and a competitive 401k) and the upper management is very approachable."
good,"taking care of the customer , troubleshooting , the network, repairing the plant change node , power supply, line amps,and splicing cable,"
good,"*coached, mentored and developed staff for success in meeting goals"
good,"A typical day at work can be a bit stressful and would flow better if there was more support for the management team. My coworkers are pleasant to work with, and I enjoy working with them. The hardest part of the job is not having the proper tools and support to make the job easier; to allow for better customer experience."
good,"Although this position claims that you work on you own, and you need to be self motivated and have freedom to work at your own pace, this is highly incorrect. Management is poor, training is worst I've ever had and the times your not successful because of the poor training it's your fault and not theirs. Micromanage to the extreme. It's all about numbers and money. Management and directors have NO consideration of you, your health, or your home life. Their biggest concern every minute of every day is numbers and making sure your putting money in their pocket. The ""constructive criticism"" makes you feel bad about yourself, no positive reinforcement. There are high and low points to your sales and when your at your lows management wants nothing to do with you and your supervisor tells you gotta hit your numbers cause your bringing down their paycheck. But when your hitting your numbers you hear nothing positive from them. And whatever you do don't ever get sick or hurt cause when your forced to miss work because of a medical condition your still required to hit numbers and make up for the time you lost even if it's 10+ days, which goes to show all they care about is numbers and money"
good,The office was run on the good ol' boy philosophy.  The opportunity to advance was there as long as you were willing to work long hours and get paid for your straight 40 hours regardless of how many you actually worked.
good,Managed a department of 12 analysts responsible for coordinating staffing levels and work schedules for 190 employees in order to effectively manage projected customer call volume. Responsible for the preparation and distribution of customer service performance statistics and call volume performance to senior management at the local and corporate level. Responsible for the preparation and management of the customer care department budgets and monthly P&L statement analysis.
good,"I am a team player who help with issues as as it does not interfer with my work flow. Troubleshooting phone, cable and internet I am good at all of them. I have a great insight and plenty of practice at resolving problems. I assist on iChat with the agent, handle audits, SME (subject matter expert) handle escalation calls, assist with training new hires or season agent who was out on short or long term. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting the customers and making them happy I was able to assist and get the issue resolved."
good,"the most enjoyable part the job is to be able to help people,the sacrifice I make for my family"
good,"This company was a great company to work for when they were a smaller company.  But with the growth of it, management changes, and name change.  This has become a company that is unstable and not sure is this is a long term type of company to work for."
good,"Comcast customer service and treatment stinks.  They are rude to customers, often providing them limited information and false information.  The co workers are a mixed bag, some care some don't and some are just lazy."
good,"•	“Top Sales Award” for outperforming every other region in the Corporate Accounts Sales Team."
good,"A typical day at work at Comcast was never dull, every call was different in the technical support area. The metrics required a stable, steady, calm personality to work with the clients and to transit the call to a positive experience for the caller. I learned to be innovative, determine and to make a difference in the company to promote a positive experience for all clients."
good,Working at Comcast is a good opportunity. Its not the best job but I love the people that work at the company(the co-workers that is). I do not like the higher ups with in the company. Most don't have no idea what they are doing and will put unrealistic expectations on you that you cannot follow. The structure is not so great and there is no employee input about things that we think should change.
good,Nice company to work for in certain department. Very time consuming. Not much life balance. Perks are moderate. Sales Department very competitive.
good,"Receive assigned route of six to 12 appointments at start of shift. Install or repair CATV, high speed internet and/or telephony systems in residences or commercial buildings. I learned time management skills, technical skills and refined troubleshooting skills. Management encouraged teamwork and self improvement. Co-workers were very team oriented and we looked out for each other. The hardest part of the day was when appointments took longer than time allowed, and I would get behind on appointments. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a self motivating environment, and working outside on nice days."
good,"Placed inside a retail store to be a sales representative for Comcast with very little training, very little incentives, no support fro customer support."
good,"Great people here,  but it is hard to move up in the company unless you are part of the ""group"". Benefits used to be great but that has since dwindled, and the pay is OK but not great."
good,"If you like working with the public and can handle criticism then Comcast is the place for you.  They do provide paid training and the pay was good, but you are not given enough time to provide quality work.  During busy months you can expect to work 12 hour days and work comes first while personal life comes second.  You also cannot count on the equipment that you are installing to work and you will get the blame for faulty equipment.  It actually goes against your score which in turn affects your pay.  Management does not seem to care and will do nothing to fix this problem.  You never know how long a job will take.  Some jobs are just 20 minutes while others might take you all day at one house but you still have to complete all jobs given to you for that day.(usually 8 jobs a day)"
good,"Constantly being asked to make sure other people are doing their job.  I feel like I spend more time doing other people's jobs than my own.  And to be clear, I am not talking about people within my department, but I am making sure that people through out Comcast are following the correct processes and are doing their jobs."
good,"dispatching work order jobs to techs"
good,"had fun working in this office, my supervisor was wonderful and a great mentor to me which assisted in my advancement within the company."
good,"Worked at Comcast as a Supervisor in the Retention department. I left for another opportunity outside of Comcast and tried to apply for a different position in a different department. Was told by someone in HR that the St. Paul HR Manager has informed them not to rehire employees who have left the company, even though they left in good standing. I thought Comcast was a stand up company, but I think they really give the Directors way to much freedom which makes the entire company look bad."
good,Working for this company is good for someone who isn't trained in anything else. they will train you and the pay isn't terrible after a little while. It's better for someone to start with this company if they're around 18-21 years old.
good,"There is plenty of money at this company. Very busy, high turnover and always in need. In my opinion theres no room for growth."
good,a typical work day consists of signing into computer 10 minutes early and reading your emails (company). Logging onto and preparing for days activities which consisted of non stop calls from customers that needed services to be taken care of by the CAE associate. 2 15 minute breaks and 1/2 hour lunch. The management team was very understanding and helped out whenever we needed help and was there to support us in our daily endeavors.
good,"This company is  a fair place to work, however upper management isn't fair to the workers poor communication."
good,"Survey over 2500 addresses monthly to verify paying customers, in order to convert to active customers. Update and complete production reports for tracking of technicians"
good,"I joined the Comcast team 8 years ago in search for a job that I could continue to develop my skills. I have challenged all the courses I can and have volunteered to learned new product without any compensation. I am very thankful for having worked here for as long as I have, but I am wanting to pursue a new path"
good,"taking calls  helping with billing anbd repair issues I loved  the  bouns we had. "
good,Being able to help with giving a customer a sense of security
good,"I worked as a Level-4 Communications Technician, with a focus on internet services and telephone service.  I installed and established new internet, telephone, and cable service for residential customers. I have experience troubleshooting phone, internet/computer, and cable issues.  I have experience installing, identifying problems, and resolving problems with software, hardware and peripheral devices on computers.  I also have home-networking skills (i.e., the installation of wireless and LAN networks).  I am also familiar with different operating systems, such as Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS X.  I have experience installing, troubleshooting, and activating multiple telephone lines and setting up voicemail"
good,It was an okay job. Pay and benefits were great but training was horrible. Everything I learned about that job I taught myself besides the ladder handling.
good,The coworkers were great to work with. Had some really good times and made life long friends. The conditions though were terrible. Their were days it was so hot you would be drenched before your first break. Management did not care as they sat in their air conditioned offices all day.
good,"always chasing my money, week in and week out, installs and customer service need improving"
good,"Drove around Northern Va. a lot as a sales rep."
good,"During my time with Comcast, I have had the ability to learn a great deal and expand my career.  Your management experience will differ depending on your department.  Every day presents a different challenge and are rarely the same from one day to the next."
good,"As long as you end up under great management, you should be trouble free."
good,"typical day at comcast is basically the same for most call centers, answer phone calls from inquiring customers on service, service issues, shoppers.  Some are pleasant, some are not so pleasant, but that is common in the service industry.  Co-workers are in a highly competitive environment but in the teams assigned with, they are very helpful and foster loads of competitive spirit.  Management staff is fine, some, as most workplaces have a higher drive towards team success than others, but will do what it takes to ensure your success.  There are a lot of challenges, and a lot of fun in the comcast environment, and the company provides many incentive programs to assist agents in meeting sales goals."
good,Comcast is a decent employer they just need to be more open and honest with employees
good,when i 1st started was like a small family atmosphere then slowly turned into a major corporate microscopic catastrophie.
good,If you love money then comcast is  the place for you. I love working for comcast. But management is terrible. We are micro management entirely too much which cause us to stress and affect our customer services. We has so many metrics and goals that it causes a bad customer service experience. If you work hard you will be compensated at comcast but advancement is not as easy as it seems. I was a top performer every year and i still am but all because one supervisor didnt like me cause my downward spiral in the company. A lot of time I was told that i was the top candidate for positions but they said they wouldnt promote me because what the supervisor said about me 2 years prior.
good,"Constant change that affects your pay directly month to month, the benefits are outstanding but the work environment is very unstable."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of sitting at your seat and assisting Comcast customers with questions on their bills and providing help with the payment of their bill. This was done with making a payment or setting up a payment plan and/or giving an extension to make the payment of their bill. I learned more about how a subscriber based company works on a day to day basis. Management was average. each manager had their own style. My co-workers were fine. There isn't much time to get up and socialize as there were customers constantly waiting for assistance."
good,"Comcast offers a lot of potential for improvement.  To be truly Comcastic upper management should recognize long term employees as assets to the company because of combined experience, knowledge,commitment to the customer and loyalty to the company.  "
good,We basically work in a sales force that was competitive and created friction between employees. Co workers were not honest.
good,"A fast-paced culture and at times overwhelming but challenging. A definite learning experience that can transfer to any call center, office or face to face environment. Overall great team members. If you can work in a comcast sales, billing and repair department you can work anywhere."
good,"Good company benefits"
good,A typical day at work consisted of calling customers and attempting to up sell them more services offered by Comcast.  You were expected to get right on another call once you were done with the current job.  I found I enjoyed interacting with customer and found great joy in helping them either save money or get more for what they are paying for.  I really enjoyed my Coworkers and found management was always there as their pay was affected by how well you do.
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for. You really learn to have a ""think customer first"" mentality. The people you work with can make coming to work just as enjoyable. Management tries to make sure you have good and reinforcing incentives to preform. The hardest part about the job and any job is difficult customers and feeling you cant personally help. But the management team will step in and take over. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and possible commission."
good,The owner was very accommodating. The working conditions were very good. All the equipment needed was available. pay was decent.
good,Good company over all to work for.  Management could listen to employees better.
good,"I've learned a lot about working as a team with this company, your lower totem pool of employees are awesome but when it comes to getting ahead it's all about playing political games. The hardest part of the job is probably the irate customers who constantly feel entitled to get something for nothing and that the company owes them something. "
good,"I was with Comcast for more than 7 years, in my time I advanced to higher grade services. However, by the end, my position was outsourced and after working 7+ years in bad schedules I finally had a good schedule and was told the company is doing a rotating schedule every 6 months and your schedule is based on performance and then after the first 6 month time frame they said we're extending it. They put a hold on advancement, during the economy downfall in 2008-2009 roughly, our department started talking unions because we were being mistreated and we all were brought into a meeting and told ""Go ahead get a union, we have clauses that let us do what we want, the economy is on our side"" Prior to that whenever they heard union talk, we were shown a video about pro and cons of unions. They do do some good things though such as like clockwork they would do all reviews the same time every year. Slow pay increases, it took me 7+ years to make what I made at my next job right in the door. Same type of job"
good,"I used to work in repair, dispatching technicians when needed or walking customers through fixable issues with internet or phone service. Did this for about 2 years before the company had the awesome idea of replacing us all with call centers in the Philippines. We had the option of either joining the sales department or not letting the door hit us in the behind on our way out. "
good,"The Cable division overall is a good entity of Comcast Corporation in that it offers the opportunity to work with some emerging technologies in your job role.  The is no culture that encourages professional growth/advancement.  There is little, to no training/professional development.  There are far too many reorganizations that occur on a frequent basis (sometimes 2x's a year), which in turn lead to constant job uncertainty."
good,"I learned how to adapt to change and still focus on the task at hand in order to stay successful. I learned to manage the most important asset of any organization, and that would be people. I have a proven record of meet and exceeding target goals."
good,"sale comcast products and serviceOutside sales experience or sales ability"
good,I worked for Comcast Tech Support for cable. This job expect you to sale to customers when they are calling about issues with their service. The hours are horrible as well.
good,Casual work plEveace. Everyone willing to help each other.
good,Was okay job if you like free cable and internet but there is no room for advancement
good,No Comment.. Just do your job. Stuff wasn't organized. Had to pay for your own gas. Didn't want pay you on time. Payroll would mess up.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job would be your fellow employees. throughout the day would take calls from technicians and provide support. I.E. repairing incorrect accounts so services would work. Rescheduling appts. Handling escalation requests, and dispatching work. Some of the work seemed unnecessary; if the powers that be could ever coordinate new marketing codes/promos with the regions they are being pushed to prior to releasing to public. Needed Continued testing and Quality control of new codes and promos in order to avoid unnecessary calls. The new product is always nice to see, but adding on to an overused infrastructure is never good."
good,Seems disorganized and lacks communication at times. Great benefits and co-workers.
good,Fun and interesting days. Supervisors would come to your site and assist in the installation proses if needed. The work days were long and busy.
good,"•	Coordinated events and scheduled internal/external meetings."
good,The only thing Guarranteed is what time you come to work. The technicicans are easy to get along with and they are willing to show you how to do the work.  must be willing to learn and deal with the public from all walks of life.
good,I learned how to be more confident and secure in anything I do
good,"Not much to say. I did door to door sales for Comcast in the Modesto area. The pay was good, benefits were great, but the job sucked. 12 hour days knocking on someone's door, hearing people complain about how bad your company is and how they love your competitor. People are so conditioned to not even answering the door for a door to door person anymore that I would knock on 100-150 doors a day/night and maybe talk to 20 people if I was lucky. Most of my sales were referrals, and now they have restructured the comp plan to pay us much much less for sales that come from referrals. They want people knocking doors and getting the hard sales, not people's friends, family, etc. Overall not a terrible place to work, just not for me."
good,"Meet with customers and find out their needs as it pertains to there telecommunications i.e Internet, phones and video."
good,Good Place to Work and experience a High call volume with helpful Management staff !
good,"The greatest skill I learned there was Teamwork, Working was fun and enjoyable"
good,My office is a small tech ops office with some sales and construction within the office.  We all get a long great and pull together to solve issues that may not be within our depts.
good,Comcast has T'V's in the lunch room where you can watch movies sports news whatever you like and every channel you can imagine. The hardest part of the job is never knowing what changes will come.
good,"Account Review"
good,"Pros - Great Pay and Benefits"
good,"Micromanagement is absolutely choking the life out of the sales department and management's answer is to micromanage more.  Territory is totally saturated and remaining targets are leery because of Comcast's poor performance and history.  The majority of likely customers have chargeoffs and don't qualify, making the job difficult, at best."
good,Given jobs for the day and organizing route. Good relationship with coworkers. Freedom of working alone was something that I liked. Hardest part was  getting work done in reasonable time when jobs became more complicated then expected. Managment had its good and bad days. Hard to get in contact with in a lot of cases. 
good,Benefits are great currently a lot of restructuring going on with the organization.
good,I enjoy the challenge of helping businesses determine the most cost efficient way to build their business and continue to grow through advertising. 
good,"My typical day of work consist of being logged into the phones, answering Field Eng calls for the Day of Install or Prestage Metro E customers or Cell Back Haul customers.  Turning up ports/dropping configs of the customer switch being installed and testing switches using remote testing w/ciena, JDSU.  Troubleshooting daily cisco, ciena, and juniper equips.  "
good,"looking to start a career here's the place, if you enjoy working with your hands perfect job, not stuck behind a desk out dealing with people and get the chance to use your mind as while as the skills they teach you"
good,"Full time, call center, high stress levels, inconsistent guidelines. "
good,Comcast is ok if youre a really good sales person if you like going door to door it could really be good financially to you. BUT if not...Keep looking
good,"Great teams, good training opportunities, always challenged with learning more."
good,"Elicits and records customer billing information and inquiries via computerized system."
good,The job was pretty much the same every day. Calling or taking calls from customers who were deliquent on the accounts and assisted them in becoming current.
good,"I would typically take 35-55 calls per day, assisting customers in resolving their technical issues for their TV, internet and phone services. Depending on your supervisor, there was an obvious desire for you to succeed. My co-workers were great but the job itself was extremely fast-paced and relatively stressful. The required call metrics were very high but attainable."
good,"It is a direct sales career, cold calling, door-to-door knocking and direct foot traffic. It's about getting your customer there product from start to finish, you are their direct contact."
good,They offer great benefits.
good,I loved my coworkers. They were the best thing about working there.
good,"I managed 16 techs on their daily work, I learned how to manage multiple tasks at once."
good,"I enjoy working at Comcast but advancing is non exsistent. However, I enjoyed working with my coworkers and overall it is not a stressful environment with decent pay considering our job resposiblities"
good,great pay with short hours.. Hardest part of the job is security and the management is fun but unprofessional
good,"i loved working for Comcast to begin with, loved my co-workers and all the people I got to interact with. But eventually got to the point where the same issues on the phone over and over were driving me mad and the people calling in cared not for anyone but them selves."
good,"every day process work orders, took payments, answered questions of customer wants & needs, offered multiple service to save customer $$. had the best coworkers made each day fun. and at the end of the day im happy if the customers left happy from the office"
good,"Easy job, cool atomsphere hardest part of job is dealing with irrate customers and sticking to call flow. Great benefits"
good,Overall Comcast is a good company to work for. My time with Comcast was not long due to lay off. I was previously with TCI and AT&T. Their lay off package was well explained and benificial to not only myself but my family as well.
good,"Comcast was a interesting company to work for a typical day would consist of coming in to work and signing in over the phone and expecting over one hundred phone calls a day. These phone calls consisted of people asking about there bill or product. I learned to be able to help people in a fast and consistant way. Management did the best they could do in a call center, and co-workers were always friendly, and willing to help if I had a question. The hardest part of my job was staying seated and tied to a computer for an eight hour shift. The most enjoyable part was when I would help a customer and they felt well taken care of."
good,"comcast has put so much emphasis in sale for non-sales agents, that they have sabatoged the business. comcast is a pioneer in new products but needs to focus on the infrastructure of it's ""core"" products so they will not be so many complaints when it goes down."
good,"Comcast cable is a company that you can learn many different skills from, but the company can also be stressful. The customer experience is unlike any other exprience. Th relationship that is built between the worker and the customer is priceless. The connection makes it easy to understand the customer and the issues they may have with the company."
good,"The hardest part of the job was not knowing what was going to be expected of me from day to day, the job description was constantly changing"
good,"Typical installation workdays! Meaning drive all day, eating lunch on the run, and in the field past working hours (14-16hrs)."
good,Typical day at work is between 10:30-7:30 which is not bad at all. I have learned a lot on my job and loved the position before the new changes. Commission is not the same and has dropped. The company has also change the job position to a SalesConsultant and the customers are not adapting at all. I have learned to build relationships with my customers and that is the part of the job that i love the most. I love customer service and I love helping people. The hardest part of my job is not being able to give a customer everthing they wan t but sometimes that is just not possible.
good,"great pay, good benefits, fun work envirnment, supportive staff"
good,Great experience....
good,friendly environment. awesome coworkers. management had their lapses but were fair for the most part. incentives are great. the pay wasn't fair especially for those who have worked there for a long time.
good,Managed Tech
good,"I worked the swing shift, for tech support, and billing. I meet several sale goals. it was hard to get with management my supervisor was gone allot and was hard to talk with HR unless you went threw your supervisor. It was a challenging job, working in a call center. we would have time off the phones for training and decorating are group of team members desks for holidays or special promotions."
good,"They pull you in by telling you you can advance in 6 months. What they don't tell you is you have to make 100% to plan, can not have any write ups or corrective actions for not making plan, and it is not guaranteed that you will move to a better department. ""This is your foot in the door..."" is what they tell everyone, but that is not the case. If you're great at selling, they hold you back. If you're horrible at convincing someone to get a home phone that they will rarely use, they fire you. They are constantly hiring because they are constantly firing. I've witnessed supervisors tell employees to say hello to their replacements if they don't make plan as the potential new hires are taking the tour of the building. Why would you say that? I honestly feel that department is just about making money for the company. They could care less if they are saving the customers money or even if they are making it a family environment with their employees. This is the saddest company I have ever worked for... and the most stressful. This department is filled with young adults that would rather gossip and cause drama on the sales floor, than to come to work and make money. Them not even knowing your name does not exclude you from being sent to HR over something so childish. Stay away!"
good,"a typical day at work consisted of handling 60-80 calls daily in the customer retention department. These calls varied from subscribers looking at options to lower the monthly cost of services to customer complaints in regards to services, technical issues, or broken promises."
good,"Was pleasant for the most part, the majority of co- workers was a pleasure to work for and with.The day began by correcting and preparing and verifying contractors and in house techs invoicing for the previous days work. compiling reports and feedback to management to coach, train and reinforce company policy and procedures.Verify all work orders that was going to the field were accurate prior reaching the technician assign to the job so as to ensure an smooth and easy experience for the customer and tech.The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were making the customers experience with the company a pleasant encounter."
good,"Good work enviorment, pay is lower then expected. CO workers are nice sups are ok, benefits are dissent. Hardest part of the job is Irrate customers and back to back phone calls with lil to none time to recover."
good,A typical day is fast paced. I've learned patience.
good,"take inbound and outbound calls to assist customers set up, maintain accounts."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the telecommunication interaction with customers. Providing customer service is something that comes natural to me, but it seems a little more easy when you're on the phone rather than face to face. It's easier to handle conflict that way. The only difficult task is relaying your genuineness to customers, because they are unable to see you and pick up on body language and facial expression. Creating and maintaining an empathetic tone is what will take you far."
good,good place to work if your a student. Shift schedules are always changing various shifts schedules are available to work.
good,"Its great pay, but job can be considered boring and long. Training left new employees lacking knowledge and looking for help."
good,"a really good multi-task job, you learn so much within this company, your dealing with computers all day, which will gain alot experience and knowledge"
good,This is a job with offer great benefits. They offer you the ability to a workout room and media center.
good,Friendly call center atmosphere and a decent place to work.
good,I always wanted to work for a cable company like Comcast because I did not have the experience in RG-6 and RG-11 cabling and this company sends you through hours of training to make sure you know what you are doing. The safety program is rivaled by no other company I've worked for.
good,Benefits are great and do count for a lot. However overall wage compensation is ok. Starting wage is pretty good but raises are poor even with a great review score.They are one of the lower paying telecom companies. Moving up is competitive do to the number of employees.
good,Comcast was a good place to work overall. The benefits provided allowed me to support my families needs overall. Also the ability to work from home was also nice.
good,They were very serious about numbers and attendance which is important. However the most rewarding part of the job was being there. Just showing up was rewarding.
good,"Comcast has great benefits, poor politics and culture, great commission high stress environment amongst workers and customers. Not a job for everyone."
good,The job was excellent at benefits and pay. It was also a learning experience working Comcast. It was good at motivating employees to sales products. The company also coach on better ways.
good,Good pay good benefits however The rest I would prefer not to speak on. I’m only doing this review because you guys say that is necessary to complete the changes I’ve just made on my resume
good,"- Tuition Assistance programs."
good,You can get great bonuses and free cable.. I like the fast pace environment and meeting my goals daily. You can move up and advance within the company.
good,Training was almost not existant. And In my first day I was left alone with very little training. I felt lost with very little direction. My manager did do their best to answer any questions I had
good,"The work in and of itself was fun and full filling once you get the hang of it. You get your own truck and you’re mostly on your own after training. In all fairness it’s not the worst job out there the problem lies with management. The term micro managing doesn’t do it justice. They constantly change things that obviously won’t address the intended problem, then when it inevitably fails after a few weeks it just dies and rinse and repeat."
good,"Work environment was very stressful. HR and Senior Management expectations were not realistic for the environment, time, tools and resources provided to coach and develop agents for success."
good,while the company is great to work for you have to be very careful of the politics of the sales market ion Atlanta. They play politics and favorites and will skip over you even if you are qualified
good,"Utilized the appropriate computer system to verify and update residents or guest request and activities  "
good,"Great benefits, lots of clicks working groups    Revolving door    Don’t feel all the managers/supervisors care about employees and stats are too much"
good,"Seeing a hundred faces a day, and half of them are already angry with you because of their bill. The company is expecting you to somehow upsell a portion of them everyday or every week just made me feel like a bully. I feel like I could be a salesperson but not in a position like this. I did like the job but I felt like the compensation wasn't enough for what the job entailed."
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for, however they struggle with maintaining management personnel.   This results in an unstable work environment where one is unsure of their position."
good,"Comcast is a good first job for someone needing a job. Its pay is a little low for the size company but at $15 start someone could make it work. Avoid the clicks and do your work and you could go up in the company. More specific fields, ie, IT will do well."
good,"Comcast is somewhat inflexible with work schedules, permanent schedule changes being the most difficult. Change in the work place and the skills required are changed frequently. Team placement changes frequently"
good,"The job feeds my family. I will say it a good starter job. The job is very demanding and stressful. Long hours, heavy equipment, and dealing with customers all day."
good,"Comcast is driven by sales and customer satisfaction.  Although Comcast is an innovative company, their computer system needed to be upgraded to ensure more customer satisfaction."
good,Its fast paced and you need to be self sufficient. Customers are not very nice sometimes the managers are tougher . It's a job that you have to be stern at and leave your emotions at home.
good,This has been the hardest job I've ever had as a customer service representative. You would fee pressure due to metrics that are hard to attain but when you do it would really feel rewarding.
good,Comcast is a great place to work.  It is a productive / fast pace environment.  Things change continuously.  Leadership support and growth opportunities could be better.  Comcast has excellent benefits.
good,The company has great benefits and culture. There is always organization change and your work load will continue to increase. Networking is important in moving into another role.
good,"you will deal with a lot of box swaps, returns, and people complaining about their bill. Sales are scarce so you will have to use opportunities to upgrade customers to get a sale"
good,"Company has great benefits and pays well.  Became extremely difficult to stay productive and get quality work done due to constant derailment of caused by nonstop changes to the org, direction of the business being supported, and changes to our staffing partners."
good,"But jut like all coporate offices this place can be a zoo and you do not have the best support system as they tell you will have when hired. Great benefits, free cable, 401k and stock plans. When I ask for help I feel like im bounced all around and never really get the "" correct"" answer. A lot of changes have been made this year and hopefully everything will be more in order in 2020"
good,I learned a ton while working at Comcast.  They had fantastic training and a great staff.  Great company until they decided to lay everybody off to move to Oregon.
good,"Excellent befits, good services, good environment, in the last years many changes, many agent were fired and they were replaced by young people with lower cost by hour"
good,Job was sales based/commission. Pay can vary. Heavily customer service based along with up-selling. Job can be heavily effected by outside sources like call-center and tech visits which ends up being out of your control.
good,Compensation changed drastically.. which made me start looking for other employment. Good benefits but compensation doesn’t add up. I wouldn’t recommend the residential department to anyone!
good,"Great group of people Mobile care was very challenging, It seems more like employees were teaching the company rather than the other way around. Very young branch of the company with a lot of issues needing to be resolved both with customer care and employee care."
good,"very stressful place to work, no work balance life, management always changing do not recommend.everything is always changing and management do not like pepople"
good,"As a sales representative working for Comcast was fun in the beginning. Sales incentive and recognition was extremely high! However, after a commission structure change commission and incentives were significantly decreased."
good,Don't understand why you are making me write this section if I don't want to. This is definitely a waist of time. 15 more characters to complete this.
good,My typical day on the job included logging in an hour early to review emails and/or prepare for coaching my team members. The first thing you learn at Comcast is to manage your time. This is of paramount concern in order to assist customers in a timely manner and to achieve departmental metrics.
good,It ok place to work just can b messes it you get yourself in that you have to know how to talk to people to keep your job respect go along way sometime the customer can be rude
good,I really did not enjoy working here but it beat the alternative. many different people with questionable ethics towards a commission based job. People will go behind each others back here
good,"While they do offer full benefits, you cant really afford your benefits the first five years if yoy are at the lower level. I imagine once you get away from the bs, its better pay"
good,The hours got longer and the pay got shorter to sum things up. Pay cuts here and there and no incentives to keep excellent work and attendance up. Overall not the best experience.
good,Good place to work. New Technologies.We can learn new open source frameworks. One of the Good telecom providers in USA. Introduce market demanded technologies in projects
good,This was a job that had a flexible work day. I learned more about the cable industry. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers on a daily basis.
good,"Good job , the people are very nice and encouraging. Always room to grow. The energy is awesome the leaders are great and very helpful. It can be stressful but the good always outweighs the bad."
good,Good job. Good benefits. Nice location. Metric based. Management was attentive and personal. Was able to fine tune customer service skills. Encouraged to voice opinions and thoughts. Awesome medical benefits.
good,"Good exposure to senior management. Many departments are good to work for, others not so great. All depends on your team and managers. If you end up on a good team and do well you can progress quickly."
good,comcast was a great company to work for. I felt the pay was to much based on their free services. the people were decent but I wasn't happy with management.
good,"Comcast took over the business at the time I was working there and i left shortly after, so I do not know a whole lot about working for Comcast as a whole."
good,When I first started the job it was fun but over time it became stressful. Not very transparent. No clear expectations. Policy and rules change without notice. Some unprofessional Supervisors
good,This would be consider a job for high school person who are just starting out.  They constantly changing things even when its not broke....most customers have become very unhappy with the most recent change to simple and easy.
good,The company took steps to try and retain it employees about a year after I was employed. Working conditions became slightly better. The base pay for regular hourly employees improved but the pay for commission based employees decreased drastically even while adding on new products to sale.
good,"Your basically on the phone all day taking care of customers general questions, resolving complicated issues and product needs. They offer an 8 week training course which you want to hit hard and fast. It's 90 % modules (online, videos, virtual) with little one on one training. Can be stressful, trainers and supervisors tend to drop the ball in getting you the right support even when it's communicated to them. Training overall could be better organized tailored to individuals needs. "
good,"While working at Comcast I gained a lot of knowledge and received daily on the job training. Everyday brought on new customer interactions, new scenarios and new skills to be learned."
good,"Fast paced work environment opportunities to grow with the company, I would not like to disclose any more information at this time. Great management, good work place culture."
good,"My work day is very stressful,ive learned a lot about the operating systems,the hardest part about my job is keeping my numbers matching while trying to keep customer happy"
good,Very hostile environment. A lot of favoritism. No possibility of a career path. They did not care about your issues. Nothing was never resolved. Schedule was never what I wanted.
good,comcadt good company i worked thete 17years was let go due to workmans comp claim . i planed on retireing thete but they had other thoughts .pay was good benefits good
good,"The work here is extremely intense but can be fun. There is a highly driven sales team that works tirelessly, and after long hours, they spend the evenings together having fun. This was one of the hardest jobs i have ever had and it was also one of the most fun. The pay is commission based- so you have to attack every day with a positive attitude."
good,"Every tesm at Comcast is a little different and none of them talk to one another for the most part. Comcast abuses the H1B visa program heavily so probably half of your coworkers have no choice but to work at Comcast or be deported, if they can't get lucky enough to find another company to sponsor their work visa."
good,"It's good place to start as far as Entry-level position. Don't get your hopes up for advancements. The complimentary cable service is good, it's not worth it to lose your sanity in a toxic environment. Benefits are good but this place can be a trap job for your career advancement."
good,"Fast-paced call volume, high pressure to upsell on retention calls. Great management. Very low wage. Very flexible scheduling of hours from part time to full time."
good,"I know that they take forever to hire people for a job and don't often hire from the outside without an insider's recommendation. The interview process is like walking through dark tunnels without a flashlight. The jobs are cushy and the compensation is worth it, but don't count on actually getting that job you see posted on the web. You were likely one of 300 people who applied and the one they hired came from their own department."
good,"It is an okay company to work for.  The technicians in the field are under appreciated.  The training is sub par, but the equipment and tech is cutting edge."
good,I worked at comcast I thought that the salary was low but if you hit targets your commision check could be large. It was long hours if you want to make large amounts of money.
good,"Desire to do things means little to Comcast leadership and if you ever make the mistake of expressing discontentment aloud, to a manager, you will be ""reorged"".  I was brought on hoping I'd get exposure to microservices, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.  Instead, I was immediately shuffled off as the ""legacy"" guy... a pitfall I've experienced before in my thirty years as a systems administrator.  After the first year, I got frustrated and tired of wasting my time managing a kickstart system and builiding custom ISOs.  I really wanted to go the direction I though I was going to go in and in my frustration, I removed my filter.  Now I'm a ""hardware"" guy.  This is NOT what I signed on for and no one is listening."
good,"I worked at a call center, my department was Xfinity Home retention. Calls are back to back non stop and customers are extremely angry. Customers are calling to cancel and we are not suppose to cancel accounts we are held accountable. This causes many customers to be lied to and makes them frustrated, they are bounced around from one agent to the next sense their frustration."
good,"Comcast is a fast paced, competitive sales environment.  They offer intense training to help you prepare for a typical day on the floor.  the management is driven to help you meet the aggressive sales goals set by the company"
good,"enjoyed my job and what i did did not like the micro management, great benifits and training. not happy with the metrics alotted for a technical repair person"
good,Many days of dealing with customer issues and resolving them in a timely manner. Paid weekly and raises every month. Co-workers don't work and know the system enough to make goal with out working as much as others.
good,"I have learned a lot from working a Comcast, and great customer service is the one that will always remember. It was a great company to work for, If I ever got the chance to work customer service again, I would."
good,busy call center. the home services are great. different calls and the employess are great help. management is very helpfull and they take care of their employees.
good,benefits good hours good work load was to great for time allowed for work.it has sense changed from when I worked there but that comes from others that still work there.
good,This type of work can be dangerous and also possibly bad for your health for the amount of money you are being paid. Have to work all types of bad and brutal weather for very low income.
good,"Comcast/Xfinity is your standard corporation to work for "
good,Lots of opportunity to grow and expand. Great benefits and job security. The downside is the volume of process changes and the payouts could be reevaluated.
good,"Great place to work.  Customers are rude, but what do you expect.  You do get free cable which is AWESOME!  The management seems to be a little unorganized and human resources spent more time trying to look cute rather than helping employees."
good,"With any sales job, with any large corporation, the company will say one thing only to change at any point.  At our center, promotions usually came from inside the company which was encouraging.  The work place culture came to be, at least in my opinion, that you had to drink the kool aid or keep you thoughts to yourself."
good,nothing to say. made a lot of friends and valuable relationship .JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WORKING EVERONMENT YOU MEET WITH THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. Learn to deal with each challenges as it comes
good,"Working in call centers no matter the stress level that a customer may bring I always felt secure in my job until recently. The job has become beyond stressful, the metrics have become hard to maintain. Employees are being fired and wrote up and placed on finals more than before. It is understandable that everyone has to be held accountable but one thing that always attracted me to call center job was that it was a coaching environment but the environment has become so stressful that one is not confident that they will have a job from one day to the next."
good,"Life at Comcast is very stressful, they do not back up their employees and it more about who you know not what you know to advance. The pay is good and as a front line employee you get quarterly bonus"
good,Job is very stressful the customers are rude and we are now on simple and easy the company doesn’t have discounts and people are disconnecting after being with xfinity 20+ yrs
good,"HR is suppose to be there to help you when you need medical time off. THE VERY OPPOSITE. I had to submit every form myself to corporate and was granted time off for oral surgery. When I returned 2 weeks later, they said my time off was not granted and I didn't meet my sales quota for the month so I had to be let go"
good,"Typical sales job. You go in a service customers you're not permitted to sit so you're on your feet all day, 30 minute lunch breaks. shifts last as long as you're scheduled can sometimes go overtime due to busy days."
good,"Benefits are great. Great 401K, employee stock options, tuition reimbursement courtesy services, perks, and bonuses."
good,This was my first call center job. They provided a great 6 week training program that assisted me with the understanding of the business and got me ready for the call center experience.
good,Lots of positives. Management can be afraid to enforce policies specifically with the technicians and sales representatives. Great benefits and pay is good if you hang out for a few years
good,"Working at Comcast has been difficult, they are very focused on getting new customers and making more money but not helping customers and do what is right by customers. This did not work well with my background"
good,Comcast is focused towards their goals. Individual experience would differ based on the team and manager. Good place to work. Comcast keep adopting to new technologies. Periodically revisits the managements capabilities.
good,"Comcast itself it's a great company to work with, therefore I was working as a sub-contractor the treatment was poor and also they always rushing to do the job that cause accident. I was very happy when I left that company"
good,enjoyed starting off company makes changes regularly with employee pay structure which is not good but the people were descent people as far as co workers
good,"Design, build and maintained 3 local labs and 2 remote labs (one in Chennai, India). 75 DELL & HP servers my vcenter 6.5 has 478 VM’s running different O/S’s. Wrote SOP’s on the labs and systems and created documentation. Performed PC and Linux desktop support (which included VoIP, creation of VM’s, wiring, floor layouts, door security, IP PoE cameras) for 3 departments within Comcast and Guideworks. Built DELL desktop images running Windows 7/8.1/10 and servers running either 2003/ 2008/ 2012 or 2016, P2V on physical servers all platforms, designed and planned the new Comcast center in Philly, planned, coordinated and implemented the moving of 3 Labs into the new Comcast building, created vendor relationships, purchased hardware & software for my department. License renewal for all my software and service level agreements."
good,"Work can be stressful. Must meet 80 % of sales quotas to avoid being written up and terminated,The Cable benefits are great. Comcast have the best internet;"
good,Allowed some freedom but not enough to avoid escalated calls when needed. Did not provide all tools to perform job adequately. Not enough meetings to discuss goals and such.
good,"Comcast has been an excellent place to work. It's a collaborative and fun environment, which ultimately leads to a motivated group of employees striving towards the same goal."
good,I am under a non disclosure agreement. The people at comcast are a great bunch of employee's.  Comcast does has great benefits including free service within their footprint.
good,A typical day included reading updates and making calls.  Seeking sales.  The company had very low tolerance for low performers.  They were quickly fast tracked out of the company.  There was plenty of incentives and competition on the floor.  And room for commission. Occasionally they fed the representatives and recognized top performers on the sales floor.  They also sought to promote employees and had a class n promotion and resume review.
good,"It’s not what you know, it’s who you know!  Qualified candidates for any position applied for career growth does not matter in local areas unless your relationships with group of who’s hiring."
good,The call center was very stressful but I learned a lot of technical and sales information. I enjoyed talking to customers about their Tv veiwing habits and interests.
good,This was the worst job I have ever had. Going into some of the nastiest houses just to provide cable service to the customers when that was the least thing they needed.
good,"Gives you a chance to proactively leverage your synergies.  My team was an awesome group of engineers, and thank god, no millenials, they were dowstairs busy on their apple devices."
good,Going out to other people house. Installing cable in side and out. Careful your surrounding. Sometimes you have to drill holes in the wall to run the cable to rooms
good,"I was a Contractor for Comcast and was only there to manage a Project, therefore, was not involved in the day to day business such as promotions, benefits etc.  I traveled weekly from Chicago to Philadelphia to the Headquarters.  I enjoyed working there, however, it was only a 6 month contract."
good,"not bad to start pay is good along with the benefits or great ( free cable, 401k match, great health services, and more) flexible work schedule helps with work/life balance."
good,"Billing Contracting firms for the work they performed per week."
good,"Large corporation atmosphere, open space for collaboration, great benefits, flexible hours, heavily computer focused, not a ""fun"" atmosphere, good pay"
good,"very busy and we had to save the customers from canceling there service so we could maintain revenue. Put them in a bundle they could afford, go over there current package to make sure they were willing to lose what they had for a lower bundle price point. after explaining everything they would usually keep there original service"
good,Call customers to get them to upgrade their packages on their cable connection; offering internet; phone services; and platinum packages that includes all three for a discounted rate.
good,Comcast is a great place of employment for salary and benefits.  However it was the most stressfull job I have ever had.  We are given a ladder to follow for what is available for customers but when customer complained they would get any promotion available.  I always met my numbers and enjoyed my supervisors and co-workers
good,"comcast is a good company to work for, just have to prepare yourself to work in all different types of weather. comcast pay start of rocky but and up good."
good,Comcast provided for  me and my family for 12 years.  Gave me the opportunity to travel and to meet new people. I had a great manager who always looked out for her team.
good,The money was great and i learn a lot from working with Comcast unfortunately they closed down my location. I really did enjoy working for them and it was a great opportunity for me with alot of benefits
good,"we are given reward and recognition if you perform, but the management is really not good on some occasions. And as expected we have irate callers and that it understandable since they are calling because something is wrong. It is just that their resolutions are not really satisfying"
good,They had a tendency to overhire people for this position and then give too small of a territory to work.  There was a LARGE amount of turnover in this position.
good,"Co-workers are some of the best I've ever had."
good,hard working knowing that you will have a hard time advancing if you are not apart of the social dynamic. good place for training and free equipment for home
good,The expectations are extremely high as far as sales in all levels. It can be stressful at times and the commission structure changes quite a lot which is not a good thing.
good,This company is a stressful job however the pay is good.You have several goals to meet and achieve to avoid write up.The job can be overwhelming at times and the hours are flexible
good,"Good company.  Potential to makes lots of money if you have the drive.  Hardest part of job is door to door sales grind, especially in colder weather."
good,"Work within an assigned residential territory to sell and promote the full range of products with focus on video, high-speed Internet, phone, Mobile and XFINITY home services. Communicate and develop rapport with customers. Explain our products and services in-depth and recommend the right solutions. Seek out potential new customers and upgrade existing customer's services. Meet monthly goals by 63% close rate."
good,This a typical call center environment. Very fast pace and on the phone all day. Great support and willing to give employees rewards and bonus for great work.
good,i had some personal issued that made it so i left but the place it self is great. the work was not hard the environment was usually very fun but could be serious and get stuff done
good,Comcast seems to hire only 30 and under. And was the most hostile work environment I have ever worked. Which is sad to see in todays work environment. They have no training modules in place for new employees. Training was non-existent.
good,"nice company to work for when the season is in high impact. Overall when the season changes if you are contract it is hard to locate work, and that leads to no pay, which affects you if you have a family or other obligations."
good,"Overall Comcast is not a bad place to work, benefits are good, lots of flexibility in schedule. The overall down fall is compensation is low, need to be on one page and lack of capabilities to advance"
good,I'm able to perform my job as required by my position in a professional and timely manner - As long as as I complete my job/Project within given time I'm not questioned.  Also the facility had free GYM/Ping Pong Table which was an added benefit
good,"Work life balance "
good,Ddnt work here and I don't have anything to add to this area.  you will have to get the info from somewhere else. I am sorry about this but id ont have anything to say.
good,I have gotten to know some amazing people and built some great relationships. Not a bad place at all to work. I learned a lot working for the company.
good,"Working for Comcast was great experience, but the hours were long and crazy. I had fun learning the trade, and loved the experience. This was a position for someone that is single."
good,"As a sales representative, I'd consider Comcast to be an average place to work. You are provided with a good amount of support and the goals, although difficult, are attainable. However, the pay is among the lowest in the industry, there is very little room for advancement, and you cannot help but to feel like ""a number"", as opposed to a valued employee."
good,"When arriving in the morning to the office we meet with our supervisor who gives us any pertinent information we might need for that day.  We then pick up equipment and then off to the first job.  You are given jobs usually one at a time.  Based on your ComTech level you will be routed with an install or trouble call.  I received more trouble calls because I was a ComTech4.  I learned how to troubleshoot problems well while at Comcast.  There is a very limited amount of assistance while out in the field.  It is primarily micromanagement.  The culture amongst technicians on the same crew is usually pretty good.  The teamwork is primarily up to the supervisor.  Management has stated at meetings that corporate is concerned as to why there is a huge turnover with trained employees.  Employees share amongst each other that they feel unappreciated and overworked.   One of the main topics is that new equipment and products get launched before we get the training necessary.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to plan anything on days that you work.  If you make any plans, but there are still jobs in the pool, you will not be able to get off on time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being to be out there on your own.  I really like being able to interact with my customers.  I would listen to what my customers were experiencing and then troubleshoot and find and then fix the problem.  I liked seeing my customers happy when I was finished."
good,"Love technology. Comcast was my introduction to support. Loved the Sale's and commission. I excelled. "
good,Typical call center environment. Great benefits and pay. Job became monotonous very quickly and management pushed hitting goals at the expense of the ability to provide meaningful service experience to customers.
good,"during my tenure we grew from a company providing enhanced narrow banded television reception to a corporation providing digital broadband services including television internet and telephony."
good,"I was working as a contractor for comcast since begining of 2017 till end of 2018. During the work, I learnt AWS and other new technologies and it  helped me know more about Amazon Services."
good,"For much of my nine years at Comcast, I was satisfied with my work and the local management.  My region came under different management during my final year at the company, and that management was less than competent and unsatisfactory.  Although I never complained, I was the victim of a ""reorganization"" and terminated.  I was one of three vice presidents and was the only one terminated.  I was also quite a bit older than the others."
good,"Most people don't like fast paced environments, but I do and this is very fast paced. Also, I performed tasks such as de-escalating irate customers and guiding them through issues with their TV"
good,"I am glad that I had an opportunity to work at Comcast. It gave me a chance to quickly learn what it's like to work very a very large, decentralized company."
good,This was a rapid call center of 100 seats. We were told daily to cover at least 40 tickets per day. Which I found to almost impossible if I wanted to give customers a sense to satisfaction.
good,"You can learn how to speak with customers how to fix troubleshooting and install new security service. Professional Summary Experienced Installer. I have vast knowledge of installation of 2016 – 2018"
good,"Comcast is a great place to work if you can avoid or endure the politics.  Advancing has very little to do with performance or merit, more to do with who you know.  The closer you get to senior leadership you will see how the cultural rules Comcast touts do not apply.  I believe a big part of the culture problem comes from how much people get paid, Comcast pays so well that most folks are scared to challenge the status quo.  High performers who land in the wrong spot with a boss who is playing political games could find it very frustrating."
good,"AT&T pays techs way more for the same amount of work. didn't like the fact that for you to move up in position you had to take training on your own time, which was nearly impossible"
good,Don't get me wrong here. I worked at two different Comcast sales call centers. Oregon as well as Washington. If I were just rating Oregon I'd definitely give all 5's. Manager was very supportive and helpful at all times. In Washington management was not supportive or positive.
good,I was mostly higher because I had experience and a large call center. What I was hired to do was be in the collections department basically extorting money from people who were having trouble paying their bills. That really is not my style and I’m way too nice a person to be able to do a job very well.
good,I was a contractor for them and they offer me permanent but I refused due to salary issues. Most of my friends are working here for a long time and they are happy and moved up. I will go back if I had the right opportunity as an employee.
good,Job was very fun and made money but once Xfinity came over they had a lot of layoffs. We could not make ends meet. Great place to work while it lasted
good,Dispatch was a nightmare to work with. Some supervisors make it very difficult to do well and move up in the company. The benefits were decent enough though
good,It was a good experience working from home through a third party vendor arise virtual solutions for someone like myself that is confined to a wheelchair. I learned alot. I retired for reasons that could not be explained due to privacy issues yet still my company clarityngrowth9 LLC is still allowing people to work for several fortune 500 companies through arise virtual solutions. So overall I would say it was a good experience working with arise virtual solutions
good,You have to be a motivated person and have the drive to work alone. It is an amazing company to work for and an excellent opportunity to grow. The people within the company are very helpful and strive to help you succeed.
good,You must be willing to be a go out knock on doors if needed. Comcast is not a place for the meek of heart; you must have an attack attitude and mindset to make this job work to your advantage.
good,"At the time that I worked there I was hired as a customer service rep. eventually they demanded sales and I didn't enjoy that.  Assisting customers with installment and problems with cable, phone and internet were fine."
good,The company it's self is a great company. Management of some departments are not the best or follow company mission the best. Depending on what department you get into there could be a lot of turnover.
good,"Highly motivated team player with a result driven attitude. Over ten years of experience in the retail sector driving excellent customer experiences within the store. Driving metrics through G.R.E.A.T. customer practices, retaining clientele, and initiating growth and development for myself and with my colleagues."
good,"A typical day at work is busy all day.  There is a nice work environment."
good,"This is not a bad company to work for, as a whole.  However like with any large company there are some pockets that fully part of the brand and as a result project a very different company culture."
good,It was stressful but fun place to work. We did the best each and everyday.  Comcast did paid volunteer works which were really fun. Benefits of free cable service was awesome.
good,Comcast offers many opportunities and room for advancement.  The company's leadership is always looking to transform the company and ensure that is evolving and growing.  The leadership is not content to let the company remain static.
good,Comcast is a great place to work when you consider salary and benefits. It's been many years since i have worked there. But overall was a great experience.
good,"It’s a ok place to work I’ve been there for a while, management is not really the best but some of them are great. You really have to be able to adapt to being on your own."
good,"very laid back and also very stessful and you have to get up on ladder,attic and crawl space . run wire all through people house.but it""s a good job tho"
good,there are an abundance of things to do within Comcast. They are always looking to improve and with that there is some change you must be able to handle
good,The work place is very fast pace and demanding. You have to call accounts that are old or customers that don't want to be bothered with cable solicitation due to new age generation of technology.
good,Decent company when I was employed with Comcast. Poor communication between managers and employees. Lost their employee friendliness once they purchased NBC Universal. Enjoyed by time with Comcast but was happy to leave.
good,"Call center setting, inbound calls, can be emotional and mentally stressful, many incentives for additional income, flexible work schedule, full time only for call center."
good,Most times the procedures and information was not compatible with the job to be preformed.  There were different systems for different areas and the documentation was not kept up to date regarding the installations for Cable TV and equipment.  Telephone was okay.
good,Ok place to work but needs to be more competitive with wage. there are other changes that should be made there but that's at the company's discretion.
good,what can i say about Comcast its a job just like any other job there are part of the job that you like and then there are parts of the job that you don't like that all i'm gonna say
good,"My experience was that you could make a decent living, but if your manager is not a good manager this position becomes very difficult. Lots of meetings and close management. My particular manager just had so many non-sales tasks that it was hard to focus. She was very emotional too so this was difficult and uncomfortable.  The company and culture were great though. If you are a hunter gatherer type of sales person you will do well here. Account manager type of personalities don’t do well at this job. It is a salary based plus commission and most of what you do is new sales leads from the street and door to door. I am an excellent sales person but I also like to take care of my client afterwards. I found it very difficult to do that with their cumbersome systems. Overall the company is a great company and worth checking out. Just make sure you get a good manager. They can make it or break it for you in this atmosphere."
good,In the beginning it was amazing to work for Comcast. When the company started to add more services it was no longer about helping the customer it was more about sell sell sell.
good,Good Place to work but management is unfair. Also schedules are unfair. There was many managers sharing passwords putting people not qualified in charge. As a company they have great benefits it is just management
good,"I was lucky enough to have a great manager when I worked there. I later had other people, but my first manager was by far one of my better work experiences."
good,"It was not training....It was a  it a bit confussing,"
good,ok at time for work i thing if the rite people where going could make a better place comcvast has alot to show but has yet to do any thing to fix the major issues
good,"Great benefits offered at this company, pay is very low with cost of living. Bonuses are very small. Room for advancement.  Unable to live comfortably due too low pay. Also shifts are terrible never good hours offered during bids"
good,"Great place to work for except few conditions "
good,"The culture at Comcast is that you live Comcast. There is no personal life. I personally had experiences, at a fairly low level in the corporate office, or working New Years, Christmas, etc. No boundaries what so ever."
good,THey laid me off. I trained and was the team lead for 30 people. Worked very hard doing multiple things at the same time including high level escalations that others wouldn't do or didn't know how.
good,Ever day was different and exciting.  I enjoyed taking calls and talking to customers.  The dynamics of the team were great.  I would strongly recommend this company.
good,"I would recommend anyone coming to work for Comcast, they have a lot of wonderful things to offer such as paying for schooling, free cable, internet and phone for employees, tons of Vacation time. I will however be totally honest and say do not take a job within the supply chain. It is not a very good part of the company. No over time, your not allowed to make many choices, you have to deal with lots of bad attitudes, and they often have different rules then the rest of the company. The leadership is very click-ish."
good,"Big company lots of work, always busy. Room for movement within the company. No union, but I think there is a form that you can post suggestions on it."
good,My experience in the cable industry began as an exciting adventure into the A/V world.  Due to change in ownership the work environment was not as healthy as it could be.
good,Great benefits. But stressful dealing with upset customers and not being able to provide them with proper information At times. The communication between different departments isn’t there. You only advance if the supervisors and the managers want you to advance. Doesn’t matter your experience.
good,"We were always overworked and understaffed, and poorly supervised.  Door to door outside sells is very difficult because trying to get custormers to leave their current cable provider and come to Comcast.  The different channels of sales within the company were so different examples are:  direct sales, radio sales, internet sales and phone sales.  All had different pricing and discounts."
good,"Built and cultivated a healthy pipeline of customers that was interested in partnering with the company. Identified new business opportunities through cold calling, networking, marketing and prospective database leads. Effectively communicated with clients using well-developed interpersonal skills, which helped to improve relationships and rapport. Solved customer challenges by offering relevant products and services. Set up contracts, negotiated rates and hammered out service terms. Serviced accounts on a regular basis to propose new products or services and maximize revenue. Consistently achieved 200% of monthly quota."
good,"I worked in the retail store for Comcast, I was able to assist each customer with their service, and providing excellent customer service. The training that I was given helped me with my goals."
good,"Learned that I am in control of my career"
good,"On a typical day at work at Comcast, the management and supervisors were told to impress the importance of satisfying the customer's needs. However, they rarely provided the tools to do so. They preach a good sermon, but they don't walk the walk."
good,I like this job because it was system heavy and I dealt with the techs and no customers really. My supervisor was the best. The management is very proactive with push to develop each person's talents.
good,"Nothing bad to say, good job, benefits...gets the job done. I worked in the call center so my experience comes from that. Just keep in mind everything is timed! Do not be late. Some people did not even make it through training because they could not get to work on time. That is a sad sad way to lose a job you just got."
good,"I liked the benefits. Health, vision and dental are reasonably priced. They will match how much you put into your 401k up to 6 percent. They have maternity leave."
good,"a typical day at work is sometimes stressful, workplace culture us good, management is for the most part knowledgeable, training is fun and get to know people and they have a lot of fun interaction with their employees"
good,You get to receive calls 100 per day and that's totally tiring. Most customers are irate due to poor services offered by the company. Tools are not that awesome.
good,Decent place to work other than management I also believe technicians are underpaid for amount of work done but job has a lot of perks such as benefits discounts cheaper cable and company vehicles.
good,"The opportunities for advancement are fair. If you apply yourself and work hard, you will definitely advance.  I can also appreciate the promotion from within culture, VS hiring from outside."
good,"It was a good job with good benefits, but the pay was below average. They do offer advancement and regular performance reviews with annual bonuses and raises, but it takes a long time to get to a decent livable wage. They do invest a lot in training their technicians, but they'd keep more of them and for much longer if the pay was more competitive. The schedule can be grueling as well being in a service industry that caters to customer's schedules rather than adhering to ""normal"" business hours. Not a lot of time and energy left over for personal pursuits. Typically a good amount of overtime is expected. Courtesy services were great though."
good,"Depending on  what facility you work at, the pay at Comcast is very low.and if you want to make a lateral move you might have to take a pay cut. I've had to take two pay cuts."
good,Comcast isn't the ideal job for someone with experience. It's more for the younger talent or if you just need to get by. This job can be stressful but It'll work.
good,"Nice job, no room for advancement in the corporate setting, however in the field was room for growth. I was hurt on the job and was not able to return to full active duty on the room ."
good,"Comcast does not pay enough for the stressful work environment provided.. I guess they try to make it up by providing ""okay"" benefits.. the hours after training SUCK!"
good,"This can be a very fast paced environment with a heavy call volume. If you are able to master the right balance, you are rewarded with quarterly bonuses."
good,Most work days were routine based with some spice depending on the clientele.  Was a easy to learn environment with tons of archives about products and troubleshooting methods.
good,Calling existing comcast customers about upgrading their services to a more premium package at a better dealing than they're currently paying for.  Also setting up service installationn appointments for customers
good,"good place ,a lot of new things to learn. sometimes quite stress full life, Really nice environment for finding new opportunities "
good,"I have enjoyed working for Comcast for the past 6 years.  However, I feel that I have come to a point where I'm not learning anything and I feel that I'm progressing personally and professionally.  I am feeling very stagnant in  my career at Comcast and I ready to discover other oppotuntities."
good,Will tell you one thing and do something totally different.This was an outside sales position. No help from Mgmt. Never their when you need them.(MIA)
good,"Great place to work. Competitive salary, great team mates.I always felt that I was in a better position to earn more each month. Great offices and a well know brand."
good,"There are many work locations to select which are strategically located where people can easily travel to each day.  Overall, the management needed to be more structured which placed a strain on the employees."
good,It was a good company but the fact that I was having some complications with my pregnancy during training and had no understanding and was told that I would loose my job kinda made it a no go for me.
good,same daily routine the company changes their policies so often but does provide the proper training to accomidate the changes  the turn over rate is extremely high i can imagine
good,"If anyone plans to join customer service, make sure you stay up on medication and have thick skin. Missing work  due to medical issues and expecting courtesy within the workplace are both a no go."
good,"it's fun working at comcast, you will learn a lot, but my experience at comcast is that there was a favoritism specially if the worker is related to the supervisor."
good,"Comcast was a nice company to work for. However, every time there is a major television event be prepared for those phone calls. The company is good the customers are the worst but i guess that why you;re able to get opportunities there."
good,"Profits, profits, and bigger profits through acquisition was the driving factor in the overall environment during my tenure at Comcast.  The stress created and perpetuated by management was systemic in the entire organization."
good,"I'm not sure what i am expected to say here, but i have no issues with Comcast. the company overall is a good company. it has its normal challenges like any other company."
good,The network is large with multiple vendors providing routers and switches to route traffic. Good opportunity to get hands on command line interface experience.
good,Customer satisfaction come second to job performance matrix its all about the numbers. I personally feel that they make their own customers dissatisfied because Techs are trying to get in and out as fast as possible and don't develop a relationship with customers.
good,"Could be a great place to work.  However, every department and team has a different culture in the Comcast Center.  Working Remote is an option and again it depends on the department on how flexible and how often you can work from home."
good,The job is okay it was just stressful getting chewed out by customers all day every day. It's a lot of work off the phones too. The company offers great benefits.
good,I worked in the collections department which was great it came with commission paid training and full benefits as well as full-time work it made me pretty happy to be employed there.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Comcast. The job is challenging but comes with great rewards. The pay could be a little better, though there was ample overtime availability to compensate."
good,"Company has great culture, and treats their employees fairly for the most part. The policies with the company are very strict, and hardly flexible. It has been difficult at times with computer generated policies, and management that cannot work around it."
good,"Comcast offers great benefits and work perks and it was fun to be a part of the sales team. However, the sales positions are a revolving door and the quotas eventually become hard to manage."
good,Very friendly top management. Always had and opportunity to improve my skills. All team members are seated in same location which helped in better coordination.
good,was a productive fun place provide raffles games tv in the production floor co workers were so much fun to work with and supervisor would celebrate and provide balloons on your birthday..
good,"I worked in a call center environment. Unfortunately, they have scheduling bids, which means that newer employees get stuck with graveyard shifts (more money is offered to compensate for this). Overall this was a very solid company, which great benefits and an outstanding training program."
good,Comcast Was A Fun Place To Work... Speaking With Customers And Being Very Educated On The Job Made It Easier To So When Customers Asked Questions We Could Answer Them With No Hesitation
good,it was an ok company to work for just the way management handle things and how thing where in my dep was not acceptable I do recommend to work there but no in Albuquerque call center
good,"I worked here as a tech for a bit"
good,"This was a good paying job. First 5 weeks are full time and MANDATORY at $19.70 per hour. However, didn't work for me while trying to attend University full time !"
good,"Comcast is a company with various positions available to give you many options for your career. If you excellent in your position, be on time, and be helpful... you can excel here."
good,Comcast does not believe in decent amount of pay raise and will keep the titled salary as low as they can.  It's very hard to advance within Comcast.  The products have improved such as: internet and telephone to cell phone to cable packages.  Customer service is neutral and technicians are good with arriving on time as scheduled.
good,"Answer incoming customer phone calls and take appropriate action for each call"
good,Comcast  is good for planning fun events also helpful. Open door policy is there. They never shut no one down. Working in tech support can be a challenge.
good,Great company to work for with tons of upside. You can easily start from the bottom and work your way up to the top. One of the largest cable companies in the US
good,this company open the the door to other position and had to work hard to stay and meet the coda that was put by management to meet. as time past i grow and my experience got better sales and trouble shooting swerve such HSo cable and phone
good,"Just a bull pen with bodies coming and going. training is sup par and needs attention. Its all about slamming a solution down a throat with out even knowing if it will work for clients needs, People are great, company as a whole doesn't care about anything but bottomline"
good,I worked as a project coordinator for the Comcast company of Contingent.  My managers were great and understanding if I ever needed time off and were always on hand when ever I needed an extra hand.  A lot of the work was pretty much self driven and allowed me to have a lot of control over my schedule and workload which was nice but they did require us to be on call one weekend a month.  Good experience for my first office type work setting.
good,I really enjoyed my work at Comcast tahe people was easy to talk to and management was the worste socially it was just getting them to do what you asked job related but socially it's awesome
good,"The hardest part was management, they didn't seem to take any recommendations from the employees."
good,"Cut-throat, constant stress within the company. Constant changes in operating systems, channel guides, rules as well as regulations. Good pay but very hard work, customer facing"
good,"very fast paced work environment,  always full time work, family work environment, room for advancement,  Company is competitive and constantly growing."
good,"My duties were dealing as Personal Care Consultant have to make the customer was okay with the cable,phone and internet service in the home or business"
good,satisfactory: good salary -but highly limited chance to progress and take on increased responsibility....................................................
good,Low hours snd hard labor. I recommend you do something else. Alot of walking up and down steps. And has low pay rate................................:.
good,I loved working at comcast. It was my first job in telesales and I soared beyond quota each month. I love how it feels like a family and now just managers and coworkers.
good,"Relaxed yet fast paced at times."
good,"Working at Comcast was good. But, at the time there was a lack of direction. I didn't feel like there was room for advancement. I found myself passed over for promotions despite my knowledge and tenure at the company."
good,At Comcast you are working for a computer which is constantly measuring data and does not measure effort.  There is a revolving door of employees at Comcast.
good,"What I like most about the company are the terrific benefits they offer including free education."
good,it was somewhat stressful working there. Due to lack of organization. I did work through a vendor so that could be the reason. other than that I enjoyed working there.
good,"Great would work again mike was awesome and the pay structure was right on . perfect in many ways. great staff and very organized company ,  i enjoyed my peers"
good,"Apologize to entitled customers who are upset because their over priced services are not working properly.  Give credits or free 3 month promos of HBO, STARZ, SHOWTIME."
good,"loved the job BUT it was hard to get products installed and satisfy customers needs. solicited door to door attempting to gain market share, or sale customers on coming back to comcast"
good,The position itself wasn't that much fun.  Lots of sitting and repetitive work.  The time went by slowly.  I would have liked more variety of things to do.
good,the work was easy. grab your list then grab the correct set top and put it in a box to be labeled. easy work. fast paced but easy. the manager was horrible and a mean spirited man.
good,"When i started working for Comcast it was for a specialty team, one dealing just with enterprise/businesses. After some time working as a Tier 2 while being a tear one i was put on a team that did dispatch escalations. The company had a policy for same day dispatches for businesses however the dispatch group was never really on board with that. Given this is was a very frustrating job"
good,I loved working for Comcast until management change. Management had no idea how to deal with door to door sales people. demanding a extreme amount of quota. Many employee like myself were in a position where we were looking else where for employment.
good,Excellent learning opportunities and skill building. Great benefits. Just make sure any offer presented by Human Resources or Management is in writing and signed by all.
good,Worked there as a consultant to assist in their selection of a DOCSIS provisioning system for a short time. Do not have good information on how a full time employee would like the company.
good,"It's a decent place to get a foothold and start a career in the field. They do also offer tuition assistance, which I wish I had taken advantage of! Overall the company is always trying to get you to do more for less, but my immediate management was always very good."
good,"very stressful place to work management not at sink with employees, employees are not been help by the HR department when need help. Turn around employees life is about 2-3 years."
good,"Great people to work with. The job has very attainable sales goals. Yet, the customer service line that the customers call into has much left to be desired."
good,no comment I do not work at Comcast not sure why I was prompted this survey it makes no sense but here we go a bunch of words together to make sentences that make paragraphs
good,Benefits were the main reason why I stayed with Comcast was the benefits. The management was very up and down. Communication around the departments were very inconsistent. No one was really on the same page
good,"I started off as file clerk, then promoted to customer service rep, then collections clerk, accounts payable, then dispatcher, totaling almost 6 years. the front office voted to become unionized like the back office so many managers were fired on the spot. i had to fight to get my final paycheck, calling the state labor board."
good,I do not enjoy calling residential houses door to door. Most customers have and are please with the services but I called on those that were dissatisfied.
good,"It was an OK job. Very numbers base. If you worked in inbound sales and use to upgrade sales then it is OK. "
good,"poor leadership, poor vacation day policy, decent pay, up to date computer software and systems, great benefits, unfair work schedule options and call off policy"
good,The compensation pay was some complicated formula that no employees could figure out how it worked. Which meant one month you can make a bunch of sales and be paid hardly anything and another month you could make hardly any sales and make more off commissions than previous months. The supervisors were always off of the campus running unnecessary errands  on the clock. When customers had urgent issues that needed to be resolved the supervisors would just delete the information instead of sending the ER ticket. The good supervisors would never be appreciated for their hard work and quit under the stress of holding up other supervisors lack of work.
good,"Enjoy working there, just looking to move up quicker than they can supply."
good,"great benefits for a full-time permanent employee"
good,They throw money at salespeople because you spend most of your time overcoming and repairing the damage done to your clients by the worst customer service in the nation.
good,"Fixed issues  internet connection,  billing, rate plan and promotions, channel search, remote control programming and technical visit fees.  I used Computer and answered telephone calls at the same time. Performed lots of multitasking using databases, on-line resources such as Google Maps and other tools to provide customer support"
good,"micromanaged and  stressful, on phones all day, not trained well, too many changes and no time to study the changes before they were implemented. unable to get off of night shift hours without having to work weekends"
good,I had the pleasure of working for Comcast almost five years. It had its perks but I left cause I was tired of working nights. It was difficult to get time off. Worked in the call center I tried several times applying for other positions. It just felt like favoritism and I was tired of it. Honestly was the best decision I made to leave I do not regret it. I am much happier I do miss some people I worked with but dealing with Comcast customers was the worst.
good,Do someone a favor buggy software does not alert you to an issue get the blame lose job. that pretty much sums up my time there. No previous problems or write ups and they fire you luckily the unemployment board saw it differently.
good,Management was quite generous for the most part. The Sales and marketing teams were very collaborative and easy to work with. Made great friends after I left.
good,"The actual job in the call center was a bit stressful, as most clients you talked to were upset about something not working properly. Rarely were they good phone calls, as i worked in the repair department for cable TV and internet. However, the environment was pretty chill, especially working nighttime. I enjoyed my time here"
good,"Food Loverers catering "
good,"The training was a few weeks and was very through to help you out on the floor. The company gave amazing benefits as far as television, internet and phone. The toughest part was dealing with the customers calling in. Your will get called every name in the book while you have to remain calm and collected. The worst part was that if a customer calls back after you spoke to them it counted against you even though it could have been for a different reason."
good,"Comcast Business just restructured their compensation.   Top performing agents are taking 50,000 pay cuts.   No inside sales or outbound sales agent  will make six figures in 2018 .      33,000 is the base    No longer a good job for the stress."
good,Large company. Courtesy services are a huge plus. Management was willing to work with employees to make sure they were able to perform at their best. Only issue is that as a large company they were willing to outsource work to independent contractors in advertising.
good,this wok was really fun to work in i got to learn alot from the people that worked with me the only thing is that pay its very little pay the stress you have to go through
good,"It's actually Convergys, the company. I think they were one of the biggest call center in Winnipeg at the time."
good,I enjoyed my final role which I held for 10 years however; in the last year of my employment -the environment was somewhat stressful.  My immediate group had to relocate and integrate with another group which had it's challenges.
good,"good company"
good,Very good school to work for.  Excellent network of schools.  Strong culture at every campus.  no room for advancement need to be on a need to know who you know to excel
good,"Typical day can vary base on work load"
good,"don't do it, its a trap if you're not good at sales this job isn't for you , my manager was decent but you can be on time everyday come in for extra hours do your job but I you don't make your sales you're at risk for losing your job."
good,if their service was not working made sure they went to the right department that could help. direct them to local off to come in and pick up new equipment  or pay their bil i also could take credit card payments over the phone
good,Was an ok position but the company doesn't stand behind their employees. Revolving door as far as employees go. The company also changes policy very often.
good,job was too stressful typical work I feel I was being over worked at this job the hardest part of was the rude customers who would not allow you to assist them
good,"The most stressful part of the job is dealing with challenging customers with non-Comcast related problems along with the receptiveness, hearing the same problem over and over again."
good,"Learned new skills, fun place to work, good company benefits, good incentives, great management, company that is trying to restructure their different department."
good,it was ok to work here. typical day leave your house goto your first job troubleshoot for you problems call doj for assistance. good management able to lift 60 pds
good,"Productive and fun place to work if you have a passion for helping others, New technical developments often had problems resulting many unhappy customers"
good,"•	Installation of Cable, Phone & Internet Services for Commercial & Residential "
good,"sometimes long hours, but you either can earn commission or an hourly rate.  Company vehicle is provided, must have clean driving record.  You are responsible for your equipment"
good,I have no interest in providing my personal experience with any previous employer with a third party company. It is professionally unethical to provide my opinion and it is more important what their brand says about themselves.
good,"This job was very stressful, like all call center jobs, but the lack of training made it impossible to do the job. Also there was no room for advancement,"
good,collections was made by inbound and outbound calls. every employee in the department had the same goal to collect past due balance on account and earn the collection bonus. it was difficult to get many people to pay their bill even when preventing service from being interrupted.
good,"It's a good job to have as a starter job nothing long term or perment some parts of the work place are hood and others like Hollywood don't get caught up, when you come out of traing class sit beside somebody that's been there get aways from training class people you not gone learn that way"
good,"It was a fun, every day was exciting to go on knock on doors in the city of Chicago to get new customers."
good,this is a good company to work for   great benefits vacation time off okay.  poor management. everyone treated same not for individual performance. pay is not equal to comparable companies
good,"It was a good company, I really don't have any other things to say. It was a good job, I did my job, got along with everyone. I was an amazing employee and they were amazing employers"
good,"Always have great people to work with, great supervisors and manager but that as far as it goes. Executives and hire ups don't realize where we stand as field technicians with the lack of pay and respect we receive."
good,"Typical day at work: spent a majority of the day on the phone."
good,"Good 401k plan, good benefits, pay could be better., Constant changes all the time, just not sure  about job security. Good co-workers most of the time"
good,I enjoyed my years at Comcast. As a current service member I cannot recommend a better place to work for others who have an obligation to our country. They take excellent care of ever member of the team and go a little above and beyond for those who serve.
good,"Customer retention was a stressful job as many people were already upset by the time they reached my department. High paced, and they definitely did their best to make a call center job more enjoyable."
good,"customers are so rude, management does not help when needed. scheduling every open job has become very stressful and pay sucks; always have system issues and products are good but sometimes they do not work becasue there is no teamwork"
good,"Managed Real Estate professionals to secure the right of entry commercial licensing agreement to allow Comcast to extend high-speed internet to potential end users."
good,Working in the operations area of the company was cut throat and nothing was ever good enough.  Only cared about clocking in and out and the numbers!!
good,"Constantly changing "
good,It was OK no boss breathing down your neck. No room to advance and sales quota is kinda high with a lot of sales pressure to keep your job. Company has a bad name which makes it hard to sales to customers
good,"It was a company trying to keep up with the changing way that people access entertainment. Sadly, cable is overpriced and not desirable to more and more people. The voice-remote was a good feature but cable is a dying industry."
good,"Although this is a giant corporation, they actually try to stay cutting edge......where it suits the bottom line. This is not a bad company, not in the least bit, especially if you believe in the product. The location you work at and your immediate management makes the difference in the quality of tenure."
good,"Comcast offered competitive rates, and many incentives to the crew. The hardest part of being there is trying to retain customers while trying to explain their bill and/or upsell products within a limited time frame."
good,"Normal large corporation issues, not a lot of collaboration between regions.  Hard to get information from employees.  Hard to get Northeast, Central and West divisions to all agree on a single solution."
good,It’s a regular call center with regular crazy customers....shifts are based on seniority. You have to upsell in every call and will have a certain percentages that you will have to upkeep.
good,This was a great company and would definitely want to work with them again. A company that Direct traffic of commercials on your local cable company. Yes
good,"Professional working environment with wide scope to enhance knowledge. High skilled technical colleagues, creates competitive atmosphere. Hence, pushes you to learn something new everyday."
good,Good job to have.  Pay and advancement is not up to par.  Upper management changes so much.  One person promises one thing then 6 months later the new person that came in does not follow through with what was promised to employees by the last guy.  Leaves a very negative attitude with everyone.
good,very high pressure oriented sales approach. very low commission pay. felt like i worked at a club. no professionalism in dress or demeanor. met some great people whom i keep in contact with. just not willing to go through the drama-filled day-to-day operation.
good,installed and troubled shoot equipment be willing to learn to educate yourself in order to advance and increase your pay. must meet standard when it comes to productivity in order to stick around
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to give excellent customer service , which improved customer  ratings, ability to match need to knowledge  resulted in sales"
good,"Overall, a good place to work. You are micromanaged and expected to sell to customers that are unhappy with Comcast. It's great to get nearly free services."
good,"My salaried colleagues seem to be happy with the place, but us contractors/temps suffer. They don't care about us, don't provide benefits, and will string you along with vague talk of permanent positions (that rarely or ever come your way - my manager started as a contractor and it took almost 3 years for her to be hired permanently, and my supervisor is 2 years into the same situation)."
good,"ok company as a starter job, benefits are ok, free blast interent and discounted services like cable, phone, security services and now even cell phone."
good,I really dont remember my day to day activity with this job because it was several years ago. But it is a nice company to work especially the benefits.
good,Day starts with a debriefing meeting on the days quota as well as requirements for certain shipments and storage routines. the workplace culture was helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was placing and loading orders while understaffed. The easiest part was adapting to the helpful environment.
good,did not like because every thing was so unorganized. I didn't like the work environment . I t felt like everyone was not working together to move toward our coworker goals.
good,Not my favorite place to work if you don't like being on the phone for a whole 8 hours. can be stressful with all the customer complaint and annoying questions
good,"On paper, and at times, this was a great job. The co-workers and the actual work being performed was fun, fast-paced and rewarding. I learned a lot and made some great friends along the way."
good,this is bull.  i have to fill this out to get a better job   how am i supposed to keep it moving with nonesense like this being shoved in my gullet.  another done
good,It was a constant push to exceed the level of the projected expectations.  And with the schedules it is very hard to be able to participate in family functions
good,"Comcast is great for the perks of your job. However, there are alot of people taking advantage of customers and my moral code does not agree. There's alot of politics and sometimes it was a very unprofessional environment."
good,Comcast was a good company but they started hiring senior managers that had no cable advertising experience and were trying to run it like it was a radio station (for example).
good,"It depends which department/manager you are working for. It could be difficult and stressful, could be easy and relaxed. Communication between departments is very poor."
good,You are just a number and they have no commitment to anyone that has been there for a long time   will fire a employee just to hire some one younger and making less money and benifits
good,"Benefits are the reason you work for comcast, thats it.  Pay is decent for people that dont have a degree.  But Comm Tech residential work is hard work and can be very stressful.  Once you get the hang of it I can be a balanced job.  Not for everyone.  I"
good,"Comcast is not a bad company to work for.  As a Account Executive you are carrying out  a lot of task such as sales, troubleshooting, scheduling appointments, and education customers on products.  If marketing is your gift, then this would be an ideal job for those pursuing this career.  You do make great commission if you are great at performing in sales."
good,its a great company but i got sick of getting yelled at and harrassed and demeaned by sales reps. supervisors were amazing though and benefits are great but no raise oppertunity in this department
good,helping customers with hooking up cable boxes and going over current promotions that's currently available that the customer may want or be interested in depending on their needs
good,"Left to move closer to family. Comcast was not the best or worst company to work for, benefits are good, pay is ok, but you are just a number in a huge corporation."
good,"Company doesn't stand out in one area or another.  Like many, it has the same good old boy mentality that runs rampant in many industries.  There are limited opportunities for growth and employees are worked into the ground without little appreciation or compensation."
good,"Very fast paced area at Comcast. Local market is growing extremely quick. Not enough personnel to stay in front of production goals. "
good,company want you to get job done quick as possible with not much help if needed most of time manager comes from a department that didn't work out in field bee
good,"good place to work, easy access, good employees. Mange could improve over working relationship. Salary could improve based on experience. Promotions can be based on if your liked instead of you merits, this could improve"
good,"Started out as a great place to work but as TV competition increased management tightened up and morale has dropped. Achievement targets are more and more difficult to hit and the day is pressure packed with time constraints and problems with the infrastructure that can't be fixed in one day."
good,Comcast was a cable company located in New Bedford. I was a retention specialist and was in charge of a small group of employees for training. Comcast was a great place to work.
good,They have a great training program. Some people make it harder for others to make money. they change the pay a lot. Great company but need to find a good plan that works for them.
good,"Would prefer not to respond to must in detail. Share different views of providing customer service, procedures and policies much too strict and rigid, no allowance for personal adjustments to help make job less stressful.."
good,Comcast is a fast paced company that's always focused on creating new ways to do things in the cable industry. The company is constantly changing and requires people onboard that is able to keep up with their pace.
good,"I was a retention representative for Comcast in NJ.  Management team was nice and good work environment.  However, you could get fired if all metrics are not met including first call resolution.  If a customer calls back for any reason within 7 days, that is a black mark against you. Plus you must find a way to sell to meet your goal.  Pay is low---starting salary $11.64/hr but you get commission.  New hires get medical benefits after 90 days.  Discount on cable bill if you live in a Comcast area."
good,"Assist customers with billing and/or different packages"
good,"A typical day for a corporation, not a bad company just many changes. People are nice to work with and benefits are good as well. Pay is fair just expect for changes."
good,"Troubleshoot VPN"
good,"working in repair was toxic for me. Tech repair and I would not recommend because most the call we handle were angry and highly irate customers. However, it has great benefits."
good,Executives are working to transform the culture and brand to engage more support from customers and employees alike.  The opportunities are significant as the company continues to make positive strides in the areas of customer support.  Products are excellent.
good,eh its a call center job. it is what it is. no one really likes the job but its a job. get cheap services. besides that it sucks. customers always yelling
good,My weeks dealt with a call center environment helping customers with issues related to their internet and TV issues. 9 out of 10 times I would be assisting customers with scheduling technicians to help them at their homes if the issue was on their end of the service products.
good,"I learned new direct sales techniques, and white glove customer service.  The management was very nurture and patient with their teams and the sales process. Hardest part of my job would be to have sales drop, and the most enjoyable would be to give a customer exactly what their household needs."
good,great group of people relaxed hip up beat watch out for the work life balances wanting to take off can be an issue new building friendly center city safe
good,"Comcast is a great place to grow, teach new techniques on being a customer service representative, they also work to together if there is something you don't understand, there's always somebody around to help"
good,Good place to work if you deal with the stress of management .. Very political  if you know someone that would get you promoted.  Promotion isn't based on your experience
good,"While I enjoyed the opportunity in meeting previous and new clientele, driving my own vehicle was problematic. In smaller townships, the police questioned the legitimacy of my position as it was not a COMCAST vehicle."
good,The job was good but the commute was awful. The managers were great and benefits were good. They give you plenty of vacation days and sick days. It is a repetitive job.
good,"Quotas can be a little high in summer time, techs can also blow off jobs if they please and if they do then you will not get paid until customer is installed and could effect your quota if funnel is not filled"
good,"Management talks about other employees to employees that are there and managers as well. They also to not provide a very supportive work environment. The environment they create is hostile especially if you are not apart of someone's clique or you are not good with the managers, they will make sure that your days is miserable every single day."
good,I don't actually work for Comcast. I work for a third party that works for them. I do not agree with all policies but understand them from a business standpoint.
good,"Fast paced work environment. Great place to work and grow. Provides adequate trying to do your job. also provides tools that you can use to get yourself ahead. The benefits aren't that good but they are competitive with other companies. Just like most call center settings there is drama but they do here you out and attempt to make the environment comfortable for everyone. Overall, I did enjoy working there."
good,"Very dependable job. Can receive a lot of overtime. You will have to work. Will require a lot of time away from family.   "
good,Comcast wants you to succeed they are a supportive environment they have programs for you to continue your education and they have  a learning environment.  And the management is there to help you achieve the next level of advancement if you want to go to the next level.
good,"Decent Work environment, Great benefits offered, Commission Pay is ok but can become stressful at times based off of  types calls you get. Don't become comfortable, put your time in and move around  the app is there so take advantge"
good,"This job is very stressful, and the company is a joke. They don't know what tf they want. Customer service is supposed to be their best product, but don't value when you do provide great customer service. Its all about the stats for this job. I was able to maintain great stats, but i felt like a slave working."
good,"Great opportunity to get your foot in the door as a CAE or a in-house technician.  Excellent benefits medical, free cable. The culture is metrics based and there is an expectation to sell and upsell every call.  The hardest part of the job would be to uphold the metrics required, the change in the schedule every 6months.  Locally they have customer service week where for a week they show their appreciation along with incentives throughout the year to challenge and drive you.  You are able to advance to supervisor if you so desire."
good,They pay pretty low but liked the hours and the fact that every job throughout the day was different from the last.  Very rigorous training program also
good,"exciting and much to always learn plenty of help, great supervisors, great money to earn, great perks, great incentives, great parking, great great great"
good,"You sell stuff door to door, so naturally it can be challenging. You must have tough skin and be able to accept rejection (sometimes harsh rejection) on a day-to-day basis. If you can do well and you put in the hours, you can make a lot of money. I was making an average of $4k a month, but some guys that were veterans pulled in around 7-8k a month. Great potential."
good,"Very fast past work environment which I loved, days went by fast. "
good,"High call volume , many upset customers, many want or need to lower bill/services. Many customers do not like Incoming Voice Recognition sytem that answers and routes the call.  High stress and pressure to sell additional products and services, pay is low for what the expectations are."
good,Comcast is as frustrating on the worker side as it is on the customer side.  Management is entrenched and upward mobility is difficult unless you are willing to form into their mold.  Fellow employees use sick days and FMLA as vacation creating a horrible daily experience with many missing reps daily.
good,Comcast was a good company with great benefits and 401k.  I enjoyed the independent aspect of being an installer and meeting new people everyday.   I learned how to work independently and time management skills.
good,"Decent place to work. Good work culture and work/life balance."
good,Good pay and benefits but zero growth opportunity and consolidation happens every 2 years. Constant re applying for job so there isnt much security in your job.
good,"Customer Service . Very high stress. Typical day? Busy. Had to think fast and be professional regardless of the caller and their needs and requests. Staff and co workers were very helpful."
good,"I just wrote a review for the same company. Good place to work with great benefits, free cable tv and internet great health insurance plan and 401k benefits"
good,"If you don't want to work weekends, you need not apply. I liked the free cable compensation. Their offices are nice with a gym and cable tv everywhere!!!!"
good,I have learned many things in my 17 years in the warehouse industry. I have gained a strong knowledge in inventory and QC procedures. At my current position i am in charge disposals of large quantities of outdated equipment.
good,My experience here was a roller coaster. I came in at a time when Comcast had a high demand for Customer Service Executives and because of that it was hard to move about the company. There was no room for growth.
good,"The daily challenges are easy inbound calls talk to customer sales, upsell, tech support, etc here is what i have experienced in 4 yrs "
good,"Comcast is constantly growing and changing, which could be difficult sometimes while trying to execute certain task and keeping customers happy. Dealing with unhappy customers can be challenging at times."
good,Pretty good place to work. Call center environment. Always busy with calls and dealing with issues days go fast. Pay could be better to start out with.
good,"... local general manager over-worked us. Was not unusual to work 6-70 hours per week at that time. Keep in mind that it has been many years since I worked for them."
good,It was a very stressful job at times. Some of the customers that you had to encounter were not so pleasant. overall the staff and the management were pretty easy to get along with.
good,"Comcast took over a smaller company I worked for at the time in order to acquire a large piece of the cellular market. After the takeover they moved toward eliminating the aspect of the company that supported telephony and voicemail systems, eventually selling it with no regard to their existing employees situations."
good,"Be prepared to work if you are thinking about taking a job in Finance. Understaffed groups, tight deadlines, and extensive data issues are the name of the game at Comcast."
good,"No opportunity for career path going into entry level position. Once they went to a ""regional"" level, each office had one functional role and if you wanted to pursue other opportunities with other skill levels you would have to relocate at your cost.  Basically, unless you wanted to slowly go into a supervisory or managerial level for a specific functional group in the company, you had no where else to go."
good,Comcast has great benefits even free service for employees. The pay rate for the amount of work that needs to be is unfair and is not competitive at all.
good,Comcast is a face paced environment working in the call center and involves a lot of multi-tasking. I would say that if you enjoy working with customers then Comcast is a fit.
good,Worked at Comcast Cable Headquarters in Philadelphia beginning October 2010 on large deployments.  Projects were interesting and massive.  A lot was accomplished.
good,Company chose profits over customer service and its representive of if consistent low scores on nationwide surveys of the competence of the company and its willingness to out customers first.  The culture was about individual achievement over team success. I was responsible to meet with customers and discuss needs of Phone/cable/internet. I would be assigned area to work and generate sales. Also worked different local events such as a farmers market or a Home and Garden show. While the independence of working on my own was nothing new to me there was a lack of support from management in problem solving issues with customers.
good,Had great colleagues there and the time passed quickly.  Will miss working with my peers.  Looking forward to my next opportunity in perhaps a different industry.
good,"Call center environment, structured and monitored, sit for long periods of time.  Awards received for top performance.  Not a bad place to work if you're used to working in a structured environment."
good,Enjoyed the management I worked for and with. Comcast has a very high turnover of employees. My opinion is it is due to inadequate preparation of new heirs and seting unrealistic expectations.
good,There is a few moments in the day when we can talk mostly on a break or lunch.sometimes o  lunch groups have pot lucks.safe fun and challenging work place.Friendly environment with many talent's.
good,"Comcast creates it's own issues, with tired over worked employee's. Lack of training and hot body syndrome.  With an expectation of only 390 seconds per phone call and having to sell a ""core"" service on every call it becomes a bit much.  Hard to focus on goals of selling when a customer is screaming in your head.. But offer them that phone service or you are dinged."
good,"you better like working outdoors, and hard work too. The training is lacking as far as customer service is concerned, but everything else you need to know is covered well."
good,"i learned how to assist and help irate customers throughout difficult situations, troubleshoot issues using different tools and apps and how to take payments and setup paying arrangements"
good,Good benefits hard work life balancetraveling most days between five counties in a construction based production based environment makes for a stress full day and you never know when you are getting home to your family
good,"this is a great place to work. great benefits, great pay, great advancement as well. hours are great, location is great as well. overall a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed this position for the most part, the main issue was the new rules or roll outs without giving employees enough notice or training. Management was good to work with and did listen to what employees had to say."
good,people are nice to work for and co workers were great people to meet. Sales position usually turned into 50% customer service and relations with no compensation for that work. Was compensated for sales only but provided 25 hours a week in customer service.
good,"Comcast is a very competitive environment, there are constantly events that are sales based and engage all employees, it is a very good way to motivate"
good,"Supported and fostered a high performing team environment by increased working relationships, Key POC (Point of Contact) to Customer Service Care Liaison, Directors, Leads, Managers and Supervisors."
good,"Prefer hourly flat rate vs commission"
good,Good company with a reputation that you always have to defend out in the field. Wonderful advertising products however the sales pressure and competition can get very heavy. My manager was always wonderful and you work with great people. Too many managers higher up and the has a lot to do with the pressure.
good,"Comcast needz to focus on the impression of the customer, working on improving current systems in place instead of always rolling out new..shift bids neef to be more often and consistent."
good,great place to work. Can make a lot of money in the sales department but jobs are not secure. Benefits are awesome and worth working for. Not a place for upward advancement.
good,"1- Go to peoples houses and install their cable and/or internet"
good,"I worked for Comcast retention for almost 3 years. Overall the people are great, they provide onsite gym, large call center , food on occasions , iPads for employees to use and very discounted cable. However the job itself is very tough, you deal with a lot of frustrated customers, you can very easily get burnt out as your taking back to back calls some days. The supervisors are great, management above them not so much. Overall if your looking for good pay then this will be a great option. Not much work life balance"
good,"The benefits are great. The managers are cut throat,  messy and mean. The Human Resource and managers do not care about the complaints. They all stick together and treat the employees horrible."
good,A very good place to work for. Offers great benefits and flexibility. Possibility of internal advancements. Company's open door policy is true to the the term.
good,You never know what you are going to get into on a daily basis. You get a route but you never know how smooth or rough it is going to be. Overall kept me on my toes.
good,"I love customer service duties and responsibilities, but dislike the pressure that's put on employees for not selling products, when a customer is calling solely for technical support or billing questions. Big turnover there based on the sales quotas that put on the workers."
good,"At Comcast, there are a plethora of jobs available, if you are in the right field (tech). However, there are instances in which you may need job security, this isn't the place since there are about 60% of the people that work here are temporary employees. Moreover, the compensation leaves much to be desired."
good,Very stressful. The turnover rate is well over 60%. Money can be good. Customers are hard to deal with because they are rude and feel entitled. Micro management is heavy.
good,A day at comcast was filled with challenges. The customers at times get out of hand but with great leadership it can be handled.  If you arent too computer literate they train you for the ins and outs
good,Comcast is a job. Its a place to go to get hired and to work. I remember departments competing with one anther and shady sales tactics from the managers.
good,working for comcast is okay. its a job. the benefits are okay for an employer and the compensation could be okay. but it is an okay place to work at. haven't had any problems working there
good,"I was a Customer Account Executive for three reas at Comcast, which required taking up to 70 billing/customer service related jobs per day. Very stressful."
good,the management is great and very helpful. The pay structure is terrible. I have over 12 years in the industry and they start you out at the bottom. I knew that going into the job but no one told me how long it would be to get pay increases. I finally got a pay increase after 15 months and it was a joke. The hiring manager also told me about a fast track program for guys like me during the interview as incentive for me to come aboard which i found out did not exist once hired. Disappointed to say the least!!!
good,"You have a great deal of responsibility in the DevOps environment. It challenges you to build and sustain the system operations you are responsible for. It also puts you straight in the crosshairs if there is a problem... Where you are the one up at 2 am working on fixing the issue, or whatever time the problem happens...."
good,Long days lots of calls and upset customers as any other job. Constant changes to management and policies every month. Learned a lot working her just time for a new start.
good,"Being a comcast service.representative is hard but it makes it easier because of working environment and fun workmates. I have learned to make friends,push harder to acheive goals."
good,"Great company and staff. I had a wonderful chance to get to learn the company. Wonderful co-workers, great experience to learn to one the best cable companies there are."
good,I have always enjoyed working for Comcast. However the pay is always well below the areas average for like positions and no one cares to listen or even evaluate the wages that you are being paid. Management will never tell you anything truthful and will always play the political games and when you point out that they were caught in a lie they will always have another excuse. Integrity is definitely not within the company's makeup.
good,"Benefits were great, enjoyed the comarodory. Management changes often, several re orgs over the twenty years i was there. With each re org, new leadership."
good,I provide customer service for Trouble calls and Installs. Have to know functions of several work tools to complete job. One of the lead trainers on shift. Have to climb ppoles crawls under houses go into attics and work in outdoor elements.
good,"I worked at Comcast Ad Sales, which is now Spotlight. The division was downsized, and I was left in a closed building. It was a great learning experience, but I am sure it is a very different place a dozen years later."
good,Comcast is a fast-paced and competitive work environment.  A typical day will go by very fast as there is always something going on that needs your attention.  Working here is not for the faint of heart or those who are looking to simply work 9-5.  Work/life balance is lacking for the most part but the benefits are great.
good,"There is a lot of opportunity for to develop you skills and take various training courses, internally and externally, but the the environment is very stressful at times.  On my team, many team members put their own interests fist, management showed favoritism, and it became an unhealthy team dynamic."
good,"A typical call center atmosphere, business casual attire for the most part it was a normal professional atmosphere. Team player sales driven, wages were normal."
good,The company has its ups and downs but continues to move forward in the industry. Comcast is one of the Top companies in the United States for Its field of business.
good,"This company offered excellent benefits. If you enjoy a call center setting and the all of the stipulations that comes along with it, you'll enjoy working here."
good,I had a good experience working for Comcast. The only reason I left there was my drive got pretty far and I found something closer with more money. Good Management
good,Enterprise Customer Care organization continues to grow and at times can exceed its capacity to effectively support the customer. Dedicated professionals attempting to establish a professional healthy atmosphere. Growth opportunities are minimal at the leadership level due to heavy professional nepotism of its leader.
good,"Average work environment and pay for a non union scale service industry job.  The hours can be long and strenuous at times. Difficult to meet metrics."
good,"Demonstrated ability to establish and maintain effective relationships with customers. Follow established troubleshooting procedures. Effectively gains the customer’s cooperation to work through the troubleshooting process, ensuring customer problem resolution. I developed a lot of patience and great customer service skills. One of the toughest part of the job is when customers are irate and rude, however the most enjoyable part is helping out my customers and leaving them 100% satisfied."
good,Comcast customer service might fall short but the company cares about its employees and the commission structure is fair
good,"Customer Assistance "
good,"A good company to work for, very nice people to work with. I've learned a lot working for Comcast Business. workplace culture is very good as well."
good,The day to day roles of all employees are always changing and evolving. There are many wonderful resources in every other co-worker that you meet daily. Many departments offer the opportunity to cross-train.
good,"I do not want to review this company, this is only required. I worked here, i enjoyed it. Thank you for the opportunity. This is all that i have to say."
good,"Being friendly , answer question respectably , be clear and offer what ever  options are available to the customer as the objective is to get the payment and keep them as a customer. "
good,Dealing with irate customers and not much support from the supervisors. Being penalized for not showing enough empathy because it's subject to interpretation by the supervisor.
good,"Service Org in a communications industry..."
good,A great company to begin a customer service career. I learned how to multitask using 2 billing systems and also put in orders for customers. I learned rebuttal techniques as well as selling key points. The hardest part of the job was the commute and keeping up with your quota monthly due to unpredicted company changes.
good,Company began bringing in younger employees at much lower wages and displaced senior employees with tenure and higher pay grade with no valid reason except to say job was elimininated and then next week there would be a young kid in role making a qtr of what displaced employee was making
good,It used to be a great place to work. One of the worst sales process I have experienced.Upper  Management could focused more on sales rather that Stats.
good,The company has excellent and amazing benefits however if you werent willing to sleep with someone you would go no where i did move to a higher level same job. It only inhouse agents that got promoted slept with someone in management poor poor management otherwise jobs fine and great pay they dont care much about ur family thougj
good,Great job to work for. Management was a little unorganized but it was a pleasure working there. Very hungry and focused individuals working with this company.
good,"Phenomenal place to earn good money and benefits! However, upper management is less than admirable and supervisors are lazy."
good,a typical day at work alot of standing and walking not a real fun environment. it could get very intense at times dealing with customers and trying to get old customers back.
good,"""Fast-Paced Environment"" can be overwhelming at times."
good,This company didn't seem to care for employee's. They wanted the numbers at any cost. We where knocking in sub zero weather and snow storms in order to try and meet the number model. They did however compensate very well for the hassles.
good,"At comcast you have vertical, and lateral advancement levels. also you meet good co-workers, nice mangement, and excellent health benefits."
good,"The past eight years I have been a sales an customer service trainer. The classes are on average six weeks for onboard new hires. They are taught basic customer service skills, sales skills, and use of company tools."
good,"Call center position where calls need to get answered one right after another.  Fast-paced and ever changing, you're need to be flexible in your day to day job is very important."
good,Comcast was a great company but tanked when they hired supervisors that constantly bother you to make numbers . I would never there again and advise for nobody to work there.
good,Pros and cons to this company. The benefits are good. They always want more work with less people. Do not take recommendations from  lower level employees to make for a better customer experience. There is pretty good moral.
good,I worked as a temp for the construction department and the work was not challenging as it depended on creating addresses for new customers. My supervisor was pretty laid back and the men working in the department were good to work with.
good,"This job has many perks but is not for everyone. "
good,"Great company, care about there employees and constantly offering incentives.  Benefits were amazing- plenty of time off"
good,The company I work for is a great company with room to grow. However the growth is not in an area I can call a career. The people within the company are awesome and very helpful.
good,"The job was a good job. It paid well and the benefits were good, however there were some moments times where customers that will come in hot. I've had a lot of jobs in the customer service field and I thought this would have been easy seeing that I was a customer prior. Nope. Back to back angry customers about cable, internet, and phone. It's ridiculous."
good,"not a great company. people did not enjoy working there, customers did not get very good service either. employees were treated like children"
good,A very contentious transition.  I was not sad to leave as part of the Change in Control.  Many people losing there jobs and those that stayed were expected to take up the slack ... with no additional consideration.
good,"Great company, good benefits and a nice people. I started in 1984 and worked as a construction tech, moved into Installation, service and on to Head End operations."
good,"Diverse Environment, growth opportunities, Fortune 500 company, job security, competitive pay, great benefits, must be willing to adapt to change, call center"
good,"learned a lot about the industry, how they are growing and try to compete in the market.  Have a good culture and is very diverse in their hiring process"
good,"Working here has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now."
good,"I was an over the phone tech who would walk customers through fixing their cable, internet and phone services, I would assist with billing inquiries and i would sell products and services to existing and some new clients. Over all i did enjoy working for that company."
good,Outside sales for greater Pittsburgh area. business to business sales. Main office was located in Robinson Pa. learned about sales cycles prospecting cold calling and door knocking
good,driven by money type of environment very competitive and team focused group likes to challenge the typical work place environment standards and make everything fun
good,Great team in Silicon Valley. Expect changes minimally once to twice a year. Really have to experience it to get a sense of what it's about.
good,great place to work. hands on learning while helping people. also learned tech skills and able to program and reconnect internet services
good,This company has a lot of expectations and goals to meet. Although they make it fun with rewards and challenges. They do a lot of give aways to their team.
good,"This position will throw you to the wolves.  It's up to you to come back leading them. "
good,"Extreme demands on employees, poor customer service, employees care but management not so much. High pay but dangerous work, good benefits."
good,"I was able to do my work without supervision.  If I needed to work with my team, we were allowed to collaborate on issues. I learned a lot of new technical skills. Management was awesome, until they changed directors.  I loved my co-workers.  They were always willing to help, when I was new. Hardest part of my job at the end was dealing with the time restraints that were put on us once the director changed everything about our job.  I love talking to people, and giving good customer service, as well as resolving the customers issues."
good,"I would open store, ensure all employees are at work, the uploads, checks, checklist are done and doors open at 8am. Handle customer escalation, do inventory monthly, and spot check equipment brought from warehouse and count returns, ensure reps go to lunch on time and return, ensure kiosk is cashed out nightly."
good,"Typical day at work would consist of taking calls from people who wanted to switch companies or add or remove services, or people who had service problems or billing problems, etc....  Some days would consist of team meetings in which we went over our team's numbers and other days consisted of coaching where we went over our individual performances.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and the feeling of appreciation from customers who believed I did everything in my power to help them.  The hardest part of the job was when I wasn't able to help people to their satisfaction for one reason or another despite my efforts to do so."
good,"Not getting paid for hours worked or time on the job, no leadership, no teamwork, loved working with customers and providing a great customer experience"
good,"•	Served as the client liaison for all high profile advertising sponsors of Comcast Spectacor, The Philadelphia Flyers, The Philadelphia 76ers, The Philadelphia Wings, and The Phantoms."
good,"sign into the phone and computer system, review any changers or notices.  Answer phone calls, pull up customers account on the computer review services and trouble shoot the issue the customer is having.  Find solution to the customers issue, and suggest ways to avoid pro.blems in the future.  Suggest to customer the best product or service to meet their needs,"
good,Solid company to work for. Good work life balance and decent vacation. could pay a lot more. Advancement is encouraged from training class on.
good,"Comcast is a good company, but the stress is too much! I was there for 4 years, sold a lot, made a very good income, and am so glad to not be in the meat grinder of it any longer.  I couldn't let the day go when I got home, and many said the same.  Good luck! It is a good company, but they expect your every last second of time, energy, and effort to achieve or exceed the very aggressive sales goals."
good,"Good Company with great benefits for employees. But Company mindset is lost on new hires who are seeking work. Company wants best for Customer, but is seeking to decrease customer interactions in order to limit bad customer reviews. Great mindset for younger generation who want any answer at there fingertips and are limited in human interactions."
good,"Good environment and good place."
good,Nice job with energitic performance and nice communication with managers.I had improved a lot in side of knowledge by working with this company
good,"Very good managers, Some teams are great, other not so great.  Many engineers are not longer driven nor passionate.  Customer support is terrible, including among internal engineering teams."
good,A good place to work just didn't make enough money with the hours that were required to work. co-workers were good kept to yourself in a cubical
good,Mangement has destroyed this company.  There is very little positive to say about Comcast Business and its lack luster products.  Customers area treated poorly and they can
good,"great benefits, customer service, policies, procedures, need thick ski n, fun place to work, bonuses., shift bid, flex days, vacation days"
good,I was not happy with the work/life balance. I was not happy with the hours that were offered. Benefits from Comcast are fantastic!
good,Company is inconsistent with policies and procedures. Management has no clue therefore it leaves the hourly employees stuck and clueless...
good,"Too many changes to the company and not enough time to acclimate. They claim to care about the employees, but their actions say otherwise."
good,Comcast is a great company to work for and grow within. Very great opportunities to advance in marketing and sales for residential and business.
good,They do a good job with team building. Team building meetings everyday. Meet new people everyday. The hardest part of the job is having to squeeze into tight places to fix that cables.
good,"excellent place to work i would recommend anyone to work for them. a lot of great benefits and everyone in there are very friendly, always making the job easier for the employees."
good,Loved to work at location. Helping customers with payments and making arrangements for those who could not pay full amount at the time.  Co-workers very friendly.
good,An amazing place to work. you will work with top notch technology while feeding your love of Philadelphia professional Sports.
good,"Thankful to have a job - stressful at times - I love the people I work with and it makes coming to work less stressful. You must be able to multi task and be flexible with work schedule.  Your work hours change every two years according to company's needs. Some people are angry when this happens especially those who have children and other responsibilities, such as caring for sick family member or elderly parents."
good,Totally unorganized / lack of leadership / terrible training / I learned why company is so disliked / co-workers very disatified with company
good,A great place to work if you want an understanding of innovation on how to deliver new ways of watching Cable TV.  Plus a great advantage to working for Comcast is getting free Cable TV and Internet.
good,"pretty decent place to start off, just have to find your footing when on the phone talking and explaining with the customer."
good,"Never a dull moment. Whether it was receiving items, processing paperwork, or customer service, there was always something going on. It was a great experience."
good,"I loved working for this company, The employees were great, management was excellent I would assist with billing, scheduling water deliveries,"
good,"Comcast Communications is currently modifying the way in which their products and services are to be marketed.  With the projected changes, their representatives' job descriptions are being reworked with various aspects of their content holding appeal specifically to those employees who prefer a very competitive work atmosphere.  A typical day for a Front-Facing Sales Rep will soon be solely contingent upon them meeting a definitive quota of sales.  I began working for Comcast as a Dispatcher, which I loved, but several years later, I accepted an offer to work in a local Harrisburg, PA location that was represented by their employee Union to benefit from it being much closer to my home and at the same time to benefit from union representation.   Rapid turnover in management staff make it a rather insecure environment with continuously-changing supervisory staff who, themselves, find it a constantly different atmosphere for them to work in.  Co-workers can be allies or enemies, depending on which ones are favored by your supervisory and/or administrative staff.  The most difficult part of the job is trying to meet your sales quota, and the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customers."
good,Ok to work there the hours are different two three time a year you can choose from so you can go to school or daycare it is a great way to stay on top of things in personal life.
good,"customer service, new sales, disconnect, transfer of services, billing issues, problem solving, internet/cable changes, exchanged equipment, troubleshooting for internet, cable, phone, home security,"
good,"great environment"
good,"Good and bad days as with any job, but overall a great opportunity to learn and grow as a sales professional. Pay is on par with other sales oppertunities"
good,Overall a good job. Rewards good performance. But compensation can change quickly along with policies. every day is an adventure.
good,Great company to work for. Flexible schedule and opportunity to work from home. Health benefits and 401k.  Overtime is always available. Free food sporadically.
good,high volume call center. reliable training. reliable coaching sessions. staff meetings. competitive pay. professionalism taught.
good,"In the last year many changes have been made to the work environment and the goals set for us as customer service agents keeps getting higher and higher.  "
good,"If you love meetings, you'll love it there.  Daily, weekly and monthly with no seeming purpose other than to have more meetings."
good,taking calls from very angry customers whos services never worked. and Comcast then wanted us to sell them more products while they were calling to complain about a  product not working
good,Comcast has a lot on it's plate and it does try to take care of the employees. The call center will not be for everyone but that doesn't mean there aren't other areas you can try and be successful. I would not talk a employee out of working here but caution them that they WILL work hard.
good,"The job itself was great.  I enjoyed working with the majority of my coworkers and customers.  The work varied, which could be both good and bad."
good,"Comcast can be a great company to work for...but it depends on which department you land in. I, currently, am working the pm telesales shift. First off, this is a SALES ORIENTED JOB ONLY. Its an outbound calling service, and you call the same leads daily. Customers are nearly always dissatisfied with products, pricing, and customer service so you will be getting cursed out, berated, and yelled at every week. Five weeks of intense training (Comcast University), then you will be placed on the sales floor, and it begins. You will immediately have a quota...they won't tell you that at all in the interview or in training. You have five times to hit quota (usually ranging between 19-23 sales per cycle/month) on your fifth write up you WILL GET FIRED. You will have to meet at least 90% of your goal to avoid a write up. Other than that, nice place to work. Benefits are amazing. Pay could be better (they recently raised it to $10.15 plus $7 commission. You can work up to 7 extra hrs a week. The environment can be a little immature. People are loud sometimes while you're on the phones. This job has a very high turner over rate, mainly because of people not making quotas, people getting fired for not following telemarketer rules (not reading follow throughs verbatim) or just quit due to stress. If you are a sales person, you'll do well. If you're not, enjoy your five months. And if you have no idea, you'll definitely find out here."
good,the job pays well but is extremely stressful. great benefits but dealing with angry people who hate the company is difficult. ive become used to it and handle the job extremely well
good,You have to work on your on & study to get up to speed. Its important to build relationships to gain help along the way. Its takes months to get up to speed on the technology & language. The workforce is mostly made up of contractors waiting to become full time employees.
good,"The management need to work more on their structural processes. A typical example, hardly does the upper management knows their hands from legs which its affecting the customer services of the company overall."
good,"The day was very busy, fast pace. I learned how to manage a group of 4 people. I enjoyed working my coworkers. They work as a team to get the job done."
good,"The company offers great benefits, but it doesn't listen well to its employees.  There is too much corporate structure and trying to make things better is nearly impossible.  Most supervisors are good and even some managers are but you cannot seem to get ideas or help in changing things to make them better unless you work way up past that."
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are great and good pay for how little knowledge is required to work here. The training is great very easy to follow.
good,"I was able to learn a great deal at Comcast by being apart of the very first Call Center of Excellence.  We accomplished phenomenal results in a very short time setting a benchmark for the entire company to follow."
good,Company constantly restructures and changes in ways that affect your job security and life balance. Comcast has no concern for how its business practices affect their employees daily live or future.
good,"Regional Management very controlling in Atlanta,  Overall good company worked several years.  Pay good , benefits great."
good,This is a great place to get your start in the business at the same time being around professional sports teams.  It was a true pleasure.
good,great place to work as long as  you enjoy change nothing is ever the same its  fast past environment if you have tough skin its a great place to work customers sometimes can be harsh.
good,A day would be to do install cable and internet in homes and apartments as well as trouble shooting problems. the good things was the team we all was about helping each other. the bad part was summer time in the attacks of homes.
good,"You work in all kinds of weather. It can be a challenge if you're not an outdoors person. I worked in Rockville, MD and met with people and sold them cable all over the DC metro area."
good,"A typical day was fast paced. I took a large volume of repair phone calls for video troubleshooting. "
good,"Comcast is an ok place to work, they provide everything you need to do your job. Except fair pay, which should be higher considering how much the company brings in and the challenges we go through."
good,"the position was falsely advertised all the way until training began."
good,Not an overall great training program first 90 days. considerable nepotism and favoritism shown for account adv sales positions.
good,"fun work place with a supportive management team, but compensation & benefits are below expectations. Opportunity for growth is poor and there will be a lot of un-kept promises"
good,"Goal-oriented, profit conscious, and adept to bringing ideas to reality in diverse business environments. Personal attributes in a willingness to assume responsibility, self-motivated, determination and a high degree of professional integrity."
good,Was a good place to work at during that time.  Learned of the new program that was being installed then. Co-workers were excellent.
good,"Answering calls from Cable, internet and phone customers. resolving billing issues, upselling products, troubleshooting cable services, scheduling repair and installation appointments. I make proper adjustments to account credits and/or debits. Schedule follow up calls to assure issue has been resolved."
good,Great place to work.  It's not always about the numbers.  It usually is a great place to grow and develop.  This is a growing company and a significant power in the industry.
good,made good money but company is ran by poor management in my area. They was always changing stuff around and would not let the people working for them know
good,"fun place to work"
good,"nice place to work, good people, good leaders and agents and great benefits and salary. flexible schedukes and work life balance"
good,Liked the chance to put out daily fires caused by Comcast angering customers with their sub-par 1-800 services. Liked having the flexibility in my hours.
good,I answer phones and help people with problems or troubleshooting issues that they might be experiencing with their service.  Also if there is a billing issues.
good,This job definitely involved high paced inbound calling. Prepared for customer service job. Allowed me to work with billing and customer profiles.
good,"While working for comcast I developed sales skills while assisting existing comcast customers with their internet/cable/phone issues. I enjoyed helping the customers, also securing sales and providing customers with sound knowledge of the product before closing the sales."
good,"Typical day included driving to given territory, doing door to door sales. Processing payment and occasional equipment instillation. Co workers were good at assisting each other when needed, The hardest part of the job was retaining customers However, Comcast did allow flexibility for making your own schedule,"
good,"The company itself isn't bad, Great benefits, Ability for overtime, and to make a lot of money, dress down days, as well as customer appreciation week..But the fact that it seems every customer hates Comcast is stressful. It's bittersweet at times."
good,"Comcast has great benefits, I worked in retention, not a good position, Comcast has the worst customer and basing that on I have worked in quite a few call centers. Comcast human resource is the worst being that its one woman who tells all of the employees business to her old friends on the floor."
good,"Great place to work. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics,but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Pros: Discount on cable, internet and phone."
good,"I took on multiple jobs at my time with Comcast. I have never worked for a corporation that was so big but did not communicate well so this caused so many issues within the company. I created and maintained multiple spreadsheets and took the initiative to help organize my department, for my co-workers sake and to better the flow of activity within my department. This resulted in me saving the company over $100,000.00 in truck rolls and unnecessary trouble calls."
good,Nice place to work. The culture is awesome. The pay should be a little bit more. The job is not stressful but the requirements are hard due to sales numbers.
good,Enjoyed my job duties and the support from other employees. some room for advancement but a lot of restructuring but I guess is to be expected from any company.
good,I haven't worked for this company in 10 years but many of the people I used to work with are still there so it must be a good place to work
good,"Stay motivated and keep your head down to work. youll do  very well."
good,Comcast is a very fast pace company. i enjoyed the time there  before they relocated to  Texas. ALso they provided many  trips to employees
good,Excellent work place supportive staff and management team. The compensation is not competitive for the position. Constantly changing the business practice. Excessive overtime to meet the needs of the consumer and directors.
good,"Working in a technical support or customer service capacity is always difficult. Direct supervisors are amazing and supportive to get you where you need to be. However as a whole, management is out of touch. Also the measurement of each person by ambiguous statistics is frustrating. I am a person not a spreadsheet and I do more than the spreadsheet will tell you. There is a great deal of training for this job, you get 6+ weeks of paid classroom training."
good,"The company does offer great benefis that include discounted services, great health vision and dental benefits.  The pay is on the lower side for the hourly wage however, with a commitment to sales commission will certainly make up for the lacking pay per hour.  The downside to the position is the abusive nature of the customers towards the employees for the company and the lack of back up that you get to minimize the nature of the calls.  You kind of have to just put up with it."
good,Fun place to work once the new building opened but shortly after a lot of the promised changes weren't completed. The company likes to encourage you to be self-efficient but then leaves you stranded with support.
good,"Its a job.  not a bad place to work. needs more supervisors and organization. The managers are very friendly and will try their best to assist you.  The bathrooms are clean. Everyone keeps to themselves,  Food on site and many places to eat around facility"
good,"A few pros working at Comcast was they had a pool table, basket ball hoops and ping pong tables located in the main lunch room. It allowed the employees to take healthy breaks and lunches. Outside they provided us with basketball courts and volley ball courts."
good,The management was horrible in the HR department.  A typical day was very busy.  No support from team.  Full cycle recruiting with some Employee Relations knowlege
good,"A huge company where the corporate level seem to be out of touch with whats really impacts the customer and technician, Tech moral due to constant policy and metric changes moves like a roller coaster. One second its up and the next its down, We are pushed to perform which is a good thing but there are other departments that make mistakes that makes it difficult to succeed. It make things stressful and negatively impact the customer. One thing I can say about the company is the job security. During the recession we were still at work so that was awesome. Another good thing is the ability the company gives me to pay my bills on time and enjoy life for the most part. Hopefully the line of the communication with tech operations and corporate grows in the right direction so we can give the customer the best services possible."
good,"Forward Thinking "
good,working for the company great benfits you can easy get promote. work 30 to 40 hours a week great pay.great people and will  learn from mangerment team is strong.
good,"Very progressive people and management. Knowledge of the work they want to and willing to work the extra mile just to help others. Overall, great group of people in the mid-west. It was my first job after graduation from Iowa State University in Des Moines Iowa and very proud of working with them."
good,Many opportunities to advance. Given all the tools necessary to compete the task at hand. Always offering classes to better your work and knowledge.
good,Company is great and endless opportunities. Great location in the city and people are very nice. Management wants to see their employees succeed.
good,"- install, disconnect and upgrade customers service"
good,the days were long the summers were hot and the winters were cold... trying to find the perfect climate was tough.. i learned to stay hydrated and to pack a jacket..
good,"Come in and get on the phones and take calls to troubleshoot customers internet that would be done, Learned from managers any problems that I may have had whether it be something I couldn't fix that would be there in a chat to walk you through it, Coworkers were great but not much time to interact but at lunch which was always enjoyable, The hardest part was in the beginning when it was brand new but then became easy once learned.

good,"typical day involves trouble shooting internet, TV , and telephone signals for customers."
good,A typical day at Comcast I would have answered 30-50 calls in the billing department. I would make it a goal to sell and upgrade at least 5 customers.  I love all my co-workers they would help with anything that they could.
good,Sitting at a desk answering calls with customer inquiry to cancel service looking for discounts. Comcast have a great incentive program making the day exciting.
good,Good benefits. good team I work with. Go time off. Tough to deal with callers in a retail setting. Overall I would recommend this job to others.
good,Comcast has been a great company to work for but there are certain challenges that are difficult to deal with. Upper management lacks a clear direction or understanding of what goes on during a day to day basis in the field.
good,Typically my office is very busy. we do over 500 transactions a  day. Customer generally have to wait to be seen by an agent but we try to make they experience as good as possible when they get to the agent.
good,Comcast just has to many irons in the fire.   Changing region structure in the Keystone region and really are not forthright with what the future is in this region.
good,"working for Comcast was for 6-14 days straight from 12-16 hours a day. I have learn to interact with people in there own home. I grew more respect for people. hardest part the nasty things I had to do to get the job done, but I enjoyed doing those for the nicest people I ever met."
good,"Overall, Comcast is a great company to work for.  The hardest part of the job is preparing your mind to knock on doors in all types of weather."
good,"This was the last opportunity, for me in a inductry, that has changed, with , streaming, podcast, netflix, and cell cellphones, most of the postions with Comcast, when i was there do not exsist."
good,"Day and the life of the position revolved mostly around gaining new business while maintaining the account in your territory and growing their spend and showing return on investment.  The product was great because the client could run their commercial on any network and would only appear in the areas the wanted business from, in addition, on any network they wanted to attract business from."
good,Love working here I would have actually stayed if they wouldn't have moved the company to Houston. Fun hours and lots of interaction with people daily.

good,"call center assisting cusotmers, i learned how to listen carefully to people order detail, how to effectively communicate to all types of people"
good,3 and 1/2 stars rating.  They  are not in the best interest of their customers nor do they provide you with job security. Management keeps switching every cople of months in one year I had 3 supervsiors and the most recent with no experenice in management.  Metric is all they care about not loyalty or honest hard work and effoft put in. Supervisors hold no regards to confidenatility when asked to on confindence discuss personal well being.  The company is changing and It not a company if you want to invest your time will be willing to do the same for you.
good,When you come in log into system and check emails and voice messages. Start the day with pulling reports and sending repots out to the team.
good,Strong company with good benefits and decent pay. There are advancement opportunities within the company. Policies tend to change fairly frequently and with little or no communication.
good,"I lost this job due to the long commute, and it just didn't work out. Management is always looking to drop people, and customers can be a pain to deal with over simple / small problems."
good,Worked in a very stressful environment.  Mid management was extremely difficult.  Upper management did not seem to care about building the careers of their teams only about securing their jobs.
good,"•	Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues via phone for customers using knowledge, experience, and software tools as well as trouble shooting databases.  "
good,Comcast call centers should provided part time employment fro those that are wanting to further their education. Also I believe that training was good but once on the floor I did not feel must support and help that was promised. Sometimes we were not aware of issues until a customer would call and complain. I feel that more help and support would have made the job easier and the day less stressful. By the end of the day I was exhausted. I loved my co-worker but everyone felt the dame way just there for the decent pay. The best part of the job were my co-workers. They pay was good but not worth the stress.
good,"Sales job with opportunity to make money, however managers can be little to nonexistent. For example there are many new hires that talk about how they have little to no guidance from their current manager and are thinking of leaving within 6 months on the job. These people thinking of leaving are hardworking, energetic, and motivated people. They are not slackers. They just have no guidance."
good,"very stressful, always too packed ,not enough people,management was not as understanding, too much work for one person, had to be in too many places at once ,customer was never happy"
good,"i service a great deal of business customers daily basis.  I install equipment for customers, so they can run their business on a daily"
good,"The job is stressful yet a great learning experience. A typical day at work would consist of loading up systems, checking emails, and taking technical support calls."
good,When I first started working for Comcast I feel that the environment was great.  The opportunity for advancement was great.  Then gradually changes begun to be made and it was extremely limiting and not employee focused.
good,"Take inbound sales calls for residential service placing orders for cable TV, internet, phone and home security. Answer billing related questions."
good,"Spent the work day taking calls assisting customers with billing issues and plans. Also dealt with customers that expressed bells of churn, was able to work with these customers and offer retention deals to try and retain the customers."
good,Comcast was fun with daily incentives and competitions. I learned about troubleshooting and cable set-up. Management staff were all helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving the benefits and assisting the customer's with their services.
good,The discount you get on your cable services is fairly good. The choices for health insurance are great however the mental health side is very lacking.
good,"A very stressful place... A diverse back ground. The major of resources are not available... Excellent perks would be free cable, internet, and telephone."
good,Typical day was sales getting new customers. Required a lot of sales with little time to reach you goal. Management was fair co-worker were easy to get along with.  Enjoyable part was reaching my goal.
good,"The best part of this job is the ""freedom"" you have. Just you and your route for the day. it's no fun though working in bad weather."
good,The job can be monotonous at times as you answer and field upwards of 50 phone calls daily.  Good benefits.  Performance based upward mobility.
good,This is a company that is very fast pace. And one most have the ability to work and interact with customer face to face on a daily basis.. This is a company that requires one to multi-task with cashing checks submitting loans and making customers payments.. The management  is very supportive.
good,Pay is great. Was let go because HR said it'd be cheaper to pay me unemployment rather than medical leave. I liked my job and especially the pay.
good,This is a very busy inbound call center. We are focused on making sure that the customers service are working. The hardest part of this job is dealing with people who don't have a good impression of Comcast. It is my job to try & turn that impression around.
good,"Good company. After closing facility paid for my  retraining.  learned how to trouble shoot cable, internet and phone. Management was flexable with personal issue if needed time off. hardest part of job was meeting certain quotas ."
good,"Its ok job, mostly a dead end job. Once you hit a specific spot on the ladder, thats it you get go any further. Training is ok they could do more hands on training less classroom work."
good,learned many skills including customer service sales techniques. great training but left out to dry when sent out from training not many resources to fall back on.
good,great entry level job into a huge company. part time with the ability to make full time money. great cable discount. amazing prizes
good,I started in Charleston and Transferred to Jacksonville. Company has great benefits but has changed a lot. Mangers changes and the turn over rate is high
good,"High numbers focused"

good,Supporting high producing sales team. All my knowledge of the telecommunications industry. Local management was fully engaged with the day to day business.
good,"They do believe in incentives which is a PLUS, but there's a lot of unreasonable things that goes on. Overall a really good company."
good,I have not worked there for over 7 years and do not know how the work dynamic is at this time.  I enjoyed dealing with customers but the bar was set very high for following exact instructions on phone calls whether the customer was interested or not
good,"to much pressure to hurry,need more techs.time to make time more available so you can do job correctly.also need to be more respectful to techs."
good,"At this job a typical day consisted of taking high  call volumes, any where from 35-40 calls a day. We received two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch break. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the scoring and goals that were set for employees. The best part of the job was that it was a very friendly place to be, co workers were very helpful with questions and concerns. All in all I enjoyed my time at Comcast as far as the other people go, as far as the job goes i did not enjoy it and it was not something I was completely happy with."
good,Install and maintain cable services and equipment. I like meeting different people. I like the teamwork among my co-workers. The supervisors are fair and firm.

good,"Learned about the Agile methodology used in Quality assurance process. in last project we were following the waterfall model which were not as challenging as Agile process. In Agile project we need have scrum call on daily basis to get the status from each teams like from designers, developers and QA test members and we were discussing the issue faced while testing the application  and how it need to get it resolved soon. At the start of each sprint we are having the grooming session and after that we are planning how much effort we need to put to achieve the requirements set. and at the end of each string we are trying to complete the requirement as per our planning."

good,A typical day at work consist of talking to customers and either problem solving or trying to keep customers from leaving the company.  I mostly learned how to up sale and defuse negative customer interactions. Management was always trying to come up with new ways to keep employee's motivated.  My co-workers were very knowledgeable and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was losing customers to other cable providers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers to realize savings.
good,this company has great benefits and the people are great to work with
good,"*A Wonderfull day at Work Providing Good Service"
good,"I've been at Comcast SportsNet for almost a decade. I've been promoted twice, which speaks to the opportunity to advance if you earn it, but those opportunities don't present themselves that often. I've been able to take on many different tasks, making myself a well-rounded employee."
good,Comcast has great benefits for their employees.  Great working hours and good job culture.
good,I enjoy working at Comcast. I answer phones and assist customer with technical issues.
good,Provide excellent  customer service for incoming call for potential and existing customer. Provide technical support for residential video customer. Trouble shoot Comcast and customer equipment. Answer billing inquiries and provide additional information about Comcast product and service. Responsible for time management and strive for first call resolution. Adhere to company policies and procedure. Work independently and as a team.  The hardest part was not able to resolve customer issue on first call and that could be from customer themselves not able to trouble shoot or defective equipment which would result in send out technician. Most enjoyable part is resolving customer issue on first call gaining customer trust and confidence.
good,"Each day began with Processing the WO's that shipped from our warehouse.  Double checking the inventory, & making corrections as needed.  "
good,Could have been much better to employees with longevity. Best part about working for Comcast was the customers.  I must say the hardest part of the job was the interoffice communication NONE
good,"call center enviorment, customer service provided to questions answerd about services offered, batched payment for bills received to customer accounts"
good,"Installed cable and wiring for proper home electronic setups for computers, telephones, and television entertainment systems; provided customer support answering questions and ensuring the customer was properly trained on the use of the installed equipment; excellent customer service ensuring timely arrivals and customer notification of delays."
good,Comcast is a good company to work for. I really like to be out in the field and not micro managed.
good,"Between data entry, sales and customer service, I implemented reports for total success within each department"
good,Great place to work. Would recomend to a friend. Shifts are a little crazy. Perfect working area. Managers are on hands
good,"On top of latest technologies always"
good,The job itself very fulfilling but 70 mile drive one way is too much wasted time.
good,I worked in the high speed internet department. It was easy to do and doesn't take a lot of education to do.
good,One of my favorite jobs with had it up in downs but most off the time it was awesome.
good,"Use design prints to troubleshoot, repair/replace, and test cable plant and equipment. Also trained in cable installation in the HUB to include square bundling, round bundling, organizing of cables to equipment.  Learned how to effectively manage time and troubleshoot cable equipment.  Coworkers were hardworking.  Hardest part of the job was coordinating interconnected functions."
good,"Great stable company that gives decent compensation, and excellent benefits. However, the only way to get a raise that will effect your life is to move positions/departments. The yearly increase is a pittance, meaningless essentially and they have no problem with giving you a low percent even if you have done excellent work in order to balance their department budget, and have NO problem telling you so. Obviously de-modivating. As a company to work for they are literally moving backwards in terms of being progressive and innovative. If you need a job, I reccomend it. If you have options, I would highly weigh whatever your other ones are if you are a young professional looking for a tomorrow-minded place to work."
good,The inbound call center is fast paced and the day goes by quickly. I found it challenging to serve the customer with sometime limited call time. I did enjoy the movie channel vendors when they had special gifts for selling their product.
good,Company filed for bankruptcy five weeks after I started. Not much else to say.
good,6 days a week work schedule in order to produce quota. The most enjoyable part of the job is to satisfy the customer needs with great service and product.

good,"Setting appointments with potential customers. explaining to customers the benefits and value of our products and services  and convincing them to switch to our services. managing my book of business and helping my customers anyway I can. I learned that good customer service is everything in a business. Some of the managers don't have the necessary experience to understand what we go through everyday and what it takes to do door to door sales, the ones who do are excellent to work with. I can ask any questions with my co workers and learn from the ones who have more experience than i do and that is invaluable. The hardest part of my job is not letting rejection get to you. Some times, it is very hard to do this, but I always keep my eye on my goal and stay positive. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of selling someone a product that saves them money,and that the customer is getting more value for less money."
good,It takes hard work to move up but not impossible. There are many departments that to choose from. You must stay one year before you can make a transfer.
good,"Has a lot of teambuilding and fun activities, Very customer oriented. A typical day is answering calls and resolving the customer's issues."
good,The company was great to work for before it went bankrupt and under a name change.
good,"this company pays great commission when i was there. However, the stress level is very high"
good,i loved this Job there were just some miscommunications with management.
good,Answered phones and set up accounts based on customers' preference. Deactivated accounts when requested by customer. Promoted packages when beneficial for customer.
good,loved everything about this company and the opportunity to learn the job ethics
good,"Nothing special nothing bad."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being out on your own all day. "
good,"Good employees, terrible management.  No support from the higher ups.  They will tell you that.  That you will be supported, but more often than not COMCAST is a stunning example of the ""Peter Principle"".  The office politics are fierce and unforgiving."

good,"- Data analysis"
good,Learned negotiation skills with the ability to implement ideas and create programs to further the company sales penetration.
good,"everyday at Comcast I would take inbound calls from customers needing assistance with their bill. After explaining  their bill, I would offer packages that we had available to better their service. What improved here while at Comcast was my listening skills. It was a bit difficult to manage the constant change in infrastructure but it was do able."
good,"They actually take pretty good care of their employees, I just wished they had paid more or would have given better raises."
good,"For the most part Comcast can be an enjoyable place to work. Like any other place, there are different ways to manage teams and individuals. The scheduling was a bit different as far as working shifts and days. Most shifts do not have two days off in a row."
good,Helping Customers daily to receive the best service..I helped alot of customers daily and explaining about the service of the company..

good,Comcast offers a wide level of job opportunity for everyone of all ages. Nation wide Comcast is the Largest cable operator in the United States.  Comcast is a leader in new technologies and some of the fastest high speed data.
good,"This company is no longer in business and I see why. No professionalism, don't know how to treat their employees."
good,the management and teams are cool its just the people over the phone that makes your day the worst
good,This job is challenging because you never know what each day is going to bring. I have learned that the cable industry is developing more and more each day and that with the development of digital technology it becomes more and more complex. My coworkers are very diverse and they all work together to support each other. It is exciting to see how everybody works together toward the same goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is to supply excellent customer service to the customer and to see their reaction to the technology.
good,great company to work for ... depending on department hours can be crappie. stable company.
good,Nice company to work for...great employees and nice prizes won.
good,"My tenure at Comcast was due to the fact I had moved to the area and was looking for a job.  Overall a good company, no complaints."
good,"Your typical day is providing assistance over the phone. It doesn't change. There is no room to grow. They want to promote that there is. However, the government also likes to state that they won't raise taxes. So, pick your battles. Overall, decent pay for what type of work you do and excellent benefits. You're just a statistic that can be replaced. High turn over here. I am the type of individual that has a strong scorecard month after month and I always feel like I'm ready to get fired. A lot of employee's feel like we're all just waiting for the axe. The most difficult part of this job is dealing with management that is very disconnected. Also, as you probably know customer service is not Comcast first priority. This mentality trickles down. When you attempt to really take care of a customer or go above and beyond you're typically told to not waste that much time or not to ever do so again. We're talking about calling another dept on the customer behalf, not something outlandish. Its a sad place to work. Majority of your co-workers include heavily obese individuals who mope up and down the isle ways and are very antisocial. Its a good in-between job."
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for.  It offerers plenty of Benefits to their employees. Unfortunately, the role that I am currently in is a very challenging role.  Door-to Door knocking to single family homes. In multiple scenarios is difficult to make contact with customers.  Specially now with all the social media and internet access.  Current and New customer can now go online to order or change services without having to speak to a live person.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people on a day to day basis and learning the never ending technology advancements that the world is going thru."
good,"great benefits, very aggressive monthly goals, contests, relaxed dress code, assisting incoming callers with everything from billing questions to transferring services when they move"
good,I did not mind working from home but however due to their products they were offering they kept everything at the same price which did not help with competition. Other providers were offering more for less while they offered more for more. I felt less motivated to offer for something that I knew that was not a great product.
good,inbound sales position with the ability to make a lot of commission.
good,"I tooks calls at my home office to resolve a variety of issues including problems with cable television, billing and transfers to appropriate departments.  The problems and were diverse and flexibility and product knowledge was critical.  Management was responsive, but very demanding.  Coworkers were fun and helpful at times.  I was difficult at times to assimilate rapid and ever-present changes to job responsibilities.  It was pleasant to resolve customer issues in one phone call."
good,I've learned a lot about the cable business. The job gave me the confidence to speak to people face to face.
good,Billing system problems and issues with online resource tools made it difficult to do this job.  In a fast-paced ever changing business tools to keep up to date are vital.
good,"Fun place to work, laid back atmosphere. Safe work environment."
good,"Long lines and upset customers, placing orders. Educating customers on products and different services."
good,"very stressful, but have great benefits, give you free cable, phone service, intrnt first day of employment"

good,"call customers to upgrade current packages. Teamwork is a must. very competitive envirnoment. My co-worker were very helful, we all worked together to win and to be the #1 selling team.

good,"Typical day at work is answering phones, bouncing ideas off one another, sharing new information, getting filled in on changes by management, audit work orders and enter the information into the system for billing."
good,"This job does have great benefits. A great place to get your feet wet and learn about working for a major corporation. If you want to advance from the entry level position the best thing for you to do is work hard, get your name out there, hob nob and make sure your stats are top notch. Helps to move up faster with a 4 year degree."
good,I learned great customer service skills. This was one of the most important jobs of my life. It was an experience I will never forget.
good,Answered inbound telephone calls in call center.  Sold products and services.  De-escalated upset customers.  I enjoyed helping customer's that did not understand their billing so that they were not confused all the time and offer them services that would benefit their needs.  Co-worker's are great.  Very diverse crew.  Management was very lively but sometimes lacked focus on trying to improve or assist struggling employees at times.  They rely on their Senior operators to assist them.  I am in that category.  Hardest part of the job was trying to get a change in how we may do a certain type of procedure.  I did learn how to be a great Salesperson and gained confidence in my abilities to sell products and also assist frustrated customer's with their billing and/or their services.
good,The was ok.  You got to get all the services that they offered and some high stuff for half price.
good,"Comcast was sending all the tech jobs over seas. Even though you could move up in the company them your job was sent over seas. "
good,"TECHNICAL SUPPORT REPRESENTIVED"
good,"Working in a highly dynamic work environment has given me the expertise required to handle difficult customers with professionalism and dexterity.

good,"Typical day come in sell phones "
good,"Other than the bureaucracy, I worked with a great team of people. Management is a little overwhelmed due the pressure of no execution of common sense and non necessary compliances."
good,"i worked well with others and got to know my peers like if they were family.i assited customers troubleshooting there internet,phone and some cable issue's"
good,no complaints great benefits and management. i enjoy working there
good,"Must work well independently and with others"

good,worked there for 22 years.  ale to advace throughout the compant
good,made and received calls in regards to getting cable services hooked up
good,"I worked as an indoor sales representative for Comcast. With that being said, a call center setting typically forces productivity. However, due to high demands to be on the phones at all times, there were a great deal of variables missing from making Comcast a great environment to work in. Lower management were black and white in their decision making; which is directly related to the demands that are placed upon them to make sure that their teams are constantly performing at their highest levels."
good,"Most days are very busy. One usually has to work overtime to complete the job. I learned how to install Tv and Internet services. I also learned how to fix problems within the system network to resolve customer issues. My final supervisor was very difficult for me. My co-workers were okay ,some better than others. The hardest part of the job was a severe lack of communication between me and my supervisor when I needed help solving an issue. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing job assignments correctly. I am great with customer service."
good,"Inform consumers of latest promo’s and specials"
good,"this company by fare has the best benefits, at a lower cost from what i have seen. between health benefits, stock options and a 401K. this is the place to be."

good,i put in cable boxes drop lines to the house made shore that the client was happy with my work
good,"Grew With Cable, Comcast doesn't recognize TENURE and DEDICATION. Longevity is dismissed"
good,A typical day at work was assisting customers with their cable service.
good,"Typical day at work is dealing with people from all walks, some are very understanding and welcoming. Others just have no clue. Depending on the day and job, it can be a simple routine trouble call, or a nightmare trouble call. Or it can be a one equipment install, or multi equipment install. Re-wiring a house or in its entirety or sections of a house or apartment. "
good,Worked my way up from taking calls to a supervisor. A fast paced environment focusing on performance.
good,"●	Assisted customers on a face to face basis as well as processed over 100-250 inbound and outbound calls daily."
good,"A great deal of after hour data entry of leads"
good,"high pressure sales, good money and benefits. most people who get paid most are the most unethical, but management doesn't care as long as they're making money. After 6 years of working I felt burned out, stressed out and hated my job. Now that I'm looking for another job its hard to find a call center for sales with same pay,"
good,"a typical day as an contactor could be a little bit stressful, but I have learned that if you stay positive and productive things will go your way. Dealing with management can sometimes be difficult because some tend to do things differently from one another, but u have to understand that in this field things and situations change regularly and must be very adaptive. co-workers all got along in which we all understood that its the team work makes the dream work."
good,The most enjoyable part of any job is being challenged every day with the unknown. I've learned how to work better with people and adjust with the most challenging issues. My co workers are hard workers. The hardest part of the job is working other areas when you're short staffed.
good,If you enjoy working in a fast pace environment Comcast is the company for you. There was never a dull moment in my day and the customers were extremly diverse as well. I enjoyed working at Comcast because there was always someone who I was able to help and make their day just a little more better.
good,"Due to the nature of Comcast's services, customer service related and field technician support related work is seven-days a week so forget about Saturday and Sundays off."
good,i was a contractor so we didnt get what comcast employees got

good,I enjoyed working here but was not pleased with how they laid off the department and making it more accommodating to relocate to another state.
good,"Working as Quota Analyst for Comcast has wholly increased my workplace skills. While gaining further Excel proficiency than previously attained by building and managing complex spreadsheets daily, I also gained much organizational and managerial skills by overseeing more than 150 Comcast Technicians and building future quota based upon daily manpower. The hardest part of my job would be the need to preemptively strike against booking quota patterns that could be found with deep research into future dates. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the challenge of taking on such a large amount of information and compiling it into manageable data."
good,"drive to locations fix or install cable tv, phone and internet"
good,Day to day changes as a cable installation technician.  Various complex issues with every customer.  Enjoy working with customers on a daily basis.
good,"Great place to work as far as benefits and compensation, but the leadership needs a lot of improvements to make the environment more liveable.There was a lot of childish acts and very unprofessional activity. The job itself was very easy going, but the complany didn't follow their own rules and policies."
good,"A typical day at work for me is interesting. I learn something new everyday regarding products/equipment & about different scenarios with each customer I speak with on a daily basis. There's just something special knowing that a customer is satisfied before hanging up that one call. My manager is very helpful, she knows alot about the company. I enjoy learning about the company from her. My co-workers are great, its like working with family because these are the people i see on a daily basis at least eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I made another customer happy by turning their frown upside down."
good,"Its really hard to hard to move up and all about favoritism, I have applied to countless positions to move up and I am still stuck as a tech."

Including all of the CPE (customer premise equipment) i.e. converters boxes, cable modems, phone modems, as well as any needed supplies for installations and service calls, from the cable, connectors to the service technicians. We also supply all of the needs of our maintenance and construction technicians. We also distribute and replace all of the hand and power tools each technician uses on a daily basis.  We process returned CPE from customers and send it off to the vendors for repairs. This is in addition to the normal warehouse tasks such as receiving and loading truck throughout the day. We also perform monthly inventory counts on all items in the warehouse, with a variance of less than 1%. My average variance is .23%. I am in charge of preforming or providing all required training for my direct reports. Doing semi-annual reviews; covering weekly safety topics. Making sure the sure the follow all of the OSHA and Comcast safety guidelines.  As for my specific job tasks, I have a large number of daily, weekly and monthly reports to complete, any type of escalation that is warehouse related I must rectify to everyone’s satisfaction as soon as possible.                                                                   "
good,"I enjoyed working for Comcast when I first began there, good benefits, good co workers, positive enviornment, it was pretty organized and the supervisors/managers cared about the agents not just as employees.....Then after 2 years there things went downhill, people were getting promoted that either hadn't been at the company long or just plain didn't have the experience for the positions such as lead or supervisor and people who did have the experience were left in the dust pretty much. Then they started having us take calls for other states other than what we had been trained on originally, and most agents weren't trained til months after we started taking these calls so we basically trained ourselves after being thrown to the wolves.  So with all this stuff it really made the call center a negative place to be and I feel that Comcast stopped caring about what the employees were dealing with on a daily basis and were more concerned about meeting their personal goals as managers etc."
good,Answer a high volume of calls. I have learned to be very customer focused.
good,I had a lot of fun at this place. the company itself really had nothing going for it. if it wasn't for my regulars and staff it would of been no fun.
good,"Very high call-volume which I loved kept the day moving, but too many incompetent workers which cause lots of frustration to customers and other workers.  It was pretty normal to be cussed out once a day.  Solving or helping customers putting a smile on their face was what I loved the most.  I loved also taking on a challenge and helping customers that were misrouted to me.  Management or higher up was horrible unless you kissed up to them you were unknown. The life at a desk."
good,Constantly setting you up to fail.  Set unobtainable goals for pay increase
good,Great staff. Great management. You get to meet great people.

good,"Although I have been working for this company for over 4 years, the amount of change that happens in the operation policies and methods of how they want us to do the work is just overwhelming at times! My co-workers are the best team an employee like me can ask for. The hardest thing about this job are the customers, for example, the constant complaining and anger that people feel when they walk into the store. I have had remotes flung at me, customer screaming from the top of their voices and just very rude behavior, just because they feel that, as a cable provider, we are expensive and that part I understand. But trying to explain that to customers who clearly cannot afford it, over and over 100+ per day is starting to change my opinion on how much longer I want to be here. And the sales goals keep getting raised each month, which makes it really hard and trying to sell to people who just want to lower their current plans. I have seen many loyal, hardworking employees let go due to underachieving their goals and it is sad to me. Plus the current employees who are still here, we got a pay cut! I feel that I am only as good as my last sale, I am hoping to work somewhere else and he happy again."

Through the day we made sure the cabinets were full with the equipment need for the customer.At the end of the shift we cash out of money and made deposit. If there was an issue with a customer that was out of are reach, we would then info are managment. The hardest part of the job was making sure we didn't get back up with customer in the lobby. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer was happy with the services we gave them and knowing they went home happy."
good,Good learning experience. Working alongside other students who were gaining experience in a professional setting.
good,My day consisted of taking technical an billing calls.I learned that its not what you say its how you say it. The managment team was sometimes very indecisive.

good,"Typical day starts at 7:30. Receive A.M route to start the day. If there's any problems management is pretty good with getting it handled. The Warehouse where I worked, The co-workers were all great.

The hardest part of the job is the changes in weather. The most enjoyable is our Team Work."
good,"Almost all work schedules incorporate at least one day of the weekend and when you get done each day often varies. It is a solid, ever growing company, with various types of jobs available. There seems to be a solid management vision at the corporate level and there are many great co-workers. Depending on what job you have, there can be great opportunities for satisfaction garnered from technical or customer interaction achievements. The hardest aspect tends to usually be schedule and work hours related."
good,Comcast is a great company to work. Great benefits and service offered
good,"Dispatch cable technicians to jobs, learned route management, account analysis and troubleshooting, in a corporate setting.  Management was easy to work with and for, but the atmosphere was a bit too relaxed wherein coworkers spent too much time on personal matters.

What I enjoy most about my job is the fact that my team is always there to help me and they are fun to work with.
good,"Comcast is such a huge company that many times information was constantly changing to accommodate the needs of his workers and its customers.

good,I have learned how to communicate with all differents types of people and personalities. My coworkers are great! They help make the job enjoyable and bearable. The hardest part of the job is trying to listen to what a person is saying is wrong with their service and trying to mentally figure out to issue to resolve it. The Company is always changing and closing down different departments and this makes it feel undependable and unstable.
good,Nice company to work for gives great benefits need to have a flexible schedule.
good,"A typical day at work includes just repairing and installing cable, internet and phone services. You also have to deal with irate customers in which I understand because if I had to live without TV and internet for days on end, I would be mad also. All of my co workers are decent but the management is full of it, they seem to think they can talk to people any kind of way and tell you what you should be able to do on your job when they have been out of the field for years and they don't have to deal with all of the new products that have came out i.e. cable boxes. Honestly, what makes the day better is getting to go to the homes of some pretty interesting people and just talking to them.

I learned how to provide an overall better customer experience to our consumers while strengthening my leadership skills with my employees. My co-workers were great, each bringing valuable skills sets and different perspectives to the job creating team unity. Hardest part of the job was customer retention, with more and more competitors coming about and consumers being more price conscience it was a little harder to sway customers from chasing cheap prices, the very best we could do is reinforce the value of the product so that the consumer could have all the information they needed to make an informed decision. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to grow with the company, Comcast allows for internal transfers every six months so I had the opportunity of experiencing several different aspects of the business."

good,Call center. A typical day is 7 hours on the phone dealing with Customer issues. This company requires too much for the pay/
good,"I enjoyed my collections position with Comcast, I learned alot about the cable industry and history as well as technology. Some of the management didn't seem to care much about helping their employees, were more concerned with their own personal stats. When addressed to management nothing was done, I was pretty much told I was on my own. The co-workers are great, most are very helpful and enthusiastic. The most difficult part of the job was trying to get feedback on how to improve.

good,Company is good to us. But advancement is limited. And downsizing is on horizion.

good,N/A  Home dispatch.  No two days are the same as a field technician.  High standards and fast paced.  Work life balance was tough due to shift. Customer satisfaction was highlight to job.
good,If you follow procedures internal employees would complain about inflexible attitudes when you followed company process and procedures.  Good benefits.
good,"If it is the right fit for you it is a great place to work. Go in have fun but get your work done. great benefits, quarterly bonuses, and overall good environment for the right person"
good,"Cable TV advertising sales are not easy, yet I was able to first meet and then exceed my goals. The management was ok, but the lack of good compensation meant that teams were always changing and new sales associates did not last very long."
good,"As a company Comcast does offer many benefits, the stress is overwhelming. Too much pressure to sale products that does not interest the customer. I worked at Comcast almost 14 years which was a good experience, is time to move on, answering call after call without any pause between calls can get very stressful and specially wearing a headset 8 hours a day."
good,Great company to work for just don't have any pre existing ailments because they will accommodate in the beginning then find a reason to fire you. Overall rating is a 3.5
good,"Comcast provides excellent benefits however, the stress comes from the companies failure to not have a accountability department. Too many mistakes made and customers call in and curse us out due to broken promises. They need to revamp the way they train employees and also management. Also they need to change the way they do paid time off because work and life balance is impossible if you have small children"
good,"I've been working at Comcast since 2014 and I've learned every day since my first day. I have great management and co workers who are very helpful, informative and always show their support."
good,"- Typical day is usually hectic"
good,Comcast used to be a good place to work or at least that's what I thought everyone is put against everyone so advancement is very hard the metrics are impossible to reach maybe 3 percent advance out of sheer luck. When you complain about the metrics  they say it's your fault but in reality you have no control of any metric alot of techs left because of it
good,"Decent place to work., and they have good benefits and generous with time off ,they also have a gym that workers can use for free ,and they are innovative with their products."
good,"Working there was a pretty great experience for the most part, strong emphasis on team work and they have a lot of amenities at the center but the job is very very repetitive, you are not paid enough for the job you do and will be mislead for the position you are applying in. Once you do make it out on to the floor you can expect to take calls about every aspect of Comcast. The benefits were amazing and solely my only purpose for staying as long as I did but in my department the management was incompetent to say the least, if you asked them to do something you could expect to ask about 4 times before anything was done and if you had a problem 95% of the time they wouldn’t even know how to help you out and would direct you to either ask someone else or ask in a certain group chat for assistance . There was favoritism for sure from management and advancing was a little hard as their idea of advancing was applying for other positions in the center as upper roles were never really available to apply for, most of the people in upper roles stay or have been there for years. Upper management was even worse as they’re very defensive and dodgy I only had a great experience with 2 of the 4 upper managers I had experience with and you will get a new upper manger about every 4 months, they stress that they care about transparency and being upfront but that’s not the case. Be very careful of what you say and do because you will be let go for any reason they deem justifiable even if you had no previous corrective actions or marks on your work record and to make matters worse your supervisors"
good,I liked it for the most part but there was a lot of drama and alot of altercations at work so i mean overall the pay was really good so honestly i cant complain
good,"I was responsible for preventative and on demand amplifier maintenance as well as passive devices for coax and fiber plant."
good,"I was with them for 5 years. Finally had enough with they let call center reps blatantly mess up work orders, but still continued to put all pressure on the the tech to make everything right and work probably as well as too many new procedures that did absolutely nothing for the customer or tech but waisted everyone's time"
good,Comcast offers folks a great opportunity to grow. They invest in your leadership development through their Comcast University which is packed with great content.
good,Comcast is super-focused on revenue and profitability growth. The culture is demanding and the employees are well-compensated.  High levels of autonomy are present at the Division level.
good,The job is secure if you want it. There is a lot of gossip and cliques in the office. It’s like high school. I wish there was more diversity in the hiring and management.
good,"Great benefits that dont really balance the stress and amount of work. Training didnt cover half of what was necessary, and the work load and pace was u reasonible."
good,Customer's are nasty.......work from home in 6 months. Pushing you to sell to IRATE customers. Superviosr was lazy and didn't care.................Co-workers were helpful
good,"Most of the positions are in Philly or Denver, if you can't move to either of those locations it is hard to be considered for another position.   Management is just so so."
good,"It was a good experince building data pipeline using big data soulutions."
good,It is a decent career but a lot of rules and regulations have changed over the years so there are more tests on each job that you are at.Overall it is a good place to work as long as you can keep up with your route and the amount of work at each job.
good,"The job is very stressful, but I did learn quite a lot of customer service traits that will help me in future jobs.  The management was rotated so much, you never new who your supervisor was half the time and most of the time I had no supervisor."
good,"Do what you need and you will be rewarded, always be in the lookout for internal postings and you will be fine. Very structure human resources and free comcast services."
good,"People I worked with are great. However, work-life balance is also an opportunity due to having too much tasks on my plate so to speak, Engagement activities are also ok."
good,The job was stressful because most of the salespeople were only interested in getting sales and would mislead the customers and the customers would end up in collections and services would be disconnected. The collections department would face the brunt of the customers anger. The pay and benefits were excellent.
good,"I've learned a lot from the opportunity given to be employed and am grateful yet since Comcast had a contract with Alorica this has ended several hundred agents employment.  Also, there's been times I wished they were a family oriented company. Overall it pays bills and provides income needed to care for my family."
good,This was the first job I had when I moved to Georgia so it was only temporary. I did enjoy my coworkers and my boss was easygoing. I had fun in training and everyone was nice
good,It is a great place to work depending on the department you work in- culture varies. The hardest part of the job is the lack of system integration which makes business process challenging at times but the company is getting better.
good,"You have to be friends with upper management to get any assistance on the phones. "
good,"Too many department and no one knows what the other is doing. So they will launch something, that hasn't been approved by another department. Increasing expectation without looking at the market. Always advancing their technology,"
good,"Good culture for the customers, micromanaging environment by other supervisors, any requests to be off pretty much denied, you have to trade days with other people to be off"
good,"Great place to work, however since there is no union, there is no job security. Co-workers were friendly and supportive. Great discounts on services like phone and rental vehicles."
good,"Log in to my system and check and respond to any necessary emails and/or texts."
good,"The training component and compensation are among the best in the business. Depending upon which Division you work in, upper level management can range from collaborate to overbearing."
good,"The company is not a bad place to work, especially as an entry level position, but the metric system for technicians is not customer focused and therefore does not promote a high quality of service over quantity of jobs completed. This leads to higher customer frustration and less of a good overall experience. Promotions are based upon good metrics, but its simple to manipulate the scorecard when in fact, you can be doing a terrible job. This ultimately rewards poor or unethical workmanship and laziness and can keep the truly deserving employees out of the positions they ought to hold."
good,"•	Resolved customer complaints, answered inquiries and billing questions."
good,"Worked for Comcast for many years. Most of the employment was great assisting customers with their needs, sales etc. When Comcast decided to change to home security they fired everyone. We had to reapply for the Home security division. We were trained to sell the product as if we had the product in our homes even before the home security system was available in our area. After the service arrived we could choose to have the security in our homes but if we ever left Comcast we were told we would NOT be charged the early termination fee. I became ill and had to leave Comcast due to the illness. I turned in the home security system immediately and was still charged the early termination fee of $800.00. I had a difficult time getting the charges removed from my account and after several years and many attempts I was finally able to have the situation corrected. "
good,Be prepared to have a thick skin as you constantly get verbally abused by customers and are constantly short staffed so be prepared to work OT.  Upside great pay with reasonable uncapped commission goals and benefits.  Be prepared to not have a life outside of work and deal with the bad rep the company has with customers.
good,"Comcast was a good company , but Management needed to be better trained to handle situations that arise in the filed daily, Management was poorly trained and very disrespectful towards company personal"
good,The corporate culture should extend company wide. Corporate and Call center are two different entities. There also should be more focus on Service and less on sales.Especially in the retention environment.
good,"It's ok, but there are other jobs that pay more and have the same or better benefits. But it also depends on which department you're in. Plus there's a consist change to your work life and whats expected of you. While the pay doesn't go up that much."
good,"Highly competitive, intense, super engaging, Team chemistry is lead by management Team and maintained and cultivated by the team members and frontline."
good,Comcast is a great company with very good benefits. Unfortunately most calls aren't call related to selling which makes it difficult to meet metric goals.
good,There are a select few or lovley people but there is a culture of the people that kiss butt the most gets the highest I had a few good year with them then when the culture change and new management set in it was totally different.
good,"There are no ""typical"" days at work, every day is different. You work on a team with other techs and help each other. Like any job there are good and bad days. It's a fun job, but then there are days it's not fun as well."
good,Fast paced environment & very strict. It has been over 12 years since I have worked here. It was a job for a couple of years that sufficed for the time.
good,"Well Known Great Internet to Leverage Cross Selling!"
good,"Good experience to work in this client. Always learn something new every alternative month. Good support from managers. "
good,"Comcast offered free cable, internet and phone service to it's employees. What better way to sale the product by knowing the product. Occurrence rolled off 1 year from their anniversaries. We were allowed 13 times to be late in 1 year. I hate that the final supervisor that I worked with didn't have a backbone to stand up for her teammates."
good,the job was fun but at times there was trouble at the warehouse   because the people that work was  the best that they can be  because it was a newly open business
good,"Comcast is a large corporation.  While the intent of the leadership is good.  There seems to be a flavor of the month leadership program that is always being initiated that then dies off after a couple of months and a new program begins.  There are a lot of great people at Comcast but the company seems to run out of budget money for maintenance process and new build outs early in the year.  "
good,Comcast has great perks and benefits. It is a very fast paced environment. The company has various position but it's hard to transfer to different departments if you're trying to advance.
good,"Advancement was hard for my role, days were stressful, hard to break away from work.  Policies changing constantly, lots of confusion and job description changed."
good,"Even though its a high paced call center, you still have time to breathe and still enjoy your job. It is not made to be felt like a prison but people to become a family as a team."
good,"This is a great job for those who are trying to make their way up. the have a lot of great benefits as far as that goes, but the main issue is that if you cant handle stress don't even apply. this job will test you between having to bridge the gap of a terrible customer support system and trying to alleviate issue with the customer while maintain a slime margin of error. in which you will not have control of with over half of the situation. "
good,Great Management team with lots of support. Company is very focused on the employee experience.  Benefit package is top rate. Relaxed call center with lots of room for advancement  at the specialist level.
good,"I worked as a Customer Account Executive for 9 months at a Comcast tech support call center that has since been replaced by another company. The coworkers were okay, the pay at the time was great, but the work itself was difficult. For one, I was totally underqualified and have no idea how I was hired in the first place. I wasn't terrible at the job though, and although the majority of employees had technical degrees I did see a kid younger than me start working there immediately after working at Chick-Fil-A. But the main issue was just dealing with angry customers. Many were angry for totally justifiable reasons, but still took it out on you because you worked for the company. Some customers genuinely needed severe psychological help. I set out to do everything I could to fix the customers' problems, which was a mistake, because that lengthened the calls and we were pressured from on high to get the customer off the phone as quickly as possible so we could take another call. There is a method of making people overwork where you set goals just beyond what's possible, and I wonder if that was used because the weekly reviews rarely showed more than a couple of CAE's reaching the goal number of calls. To make things more difficult, Comcast was at a low point in public opinion at the time, and calls were routed to prioritize newly trained employees. So when a new group of people finished their month-long training class, the vast majority of calls went to the people who were on the call center floor for the first time. This caused problems due to inexperience.I eventually left to"
good,I worked here through a temp service.  The culture was cool. Management was good and the most enjoyable part of the job was the various parties.  The hardest part was being a temp an reminded of your status.
good,"I loved so many things about this company, the products, services, my peers, the leaders and all the perks that come with working at a fortune 50 company.  however, the front line employees - the agents - act entitled, and are treated as such.  the hand that feeds you - is present.  if an agent does not like your cologne that day, they will be in HR's office and you'll be (a leader) called in to be told about it.  my best description is that agents go to HR like it is FREE ice cream day - all day, every day."
good,"Too much focus on metrics, it's hurting the company more then helping. I feel money would be better spent in areas where it matters such as call center training."
good,"Worked in both sales and support. I noticed a lot of finger pointing between departments. The phrase I heard quite a bit is ""One hand doesn't know what the other is doing."" Things were being implemented to correct this when I was leaving."
good,Debe existir mas flexibilidad en cuanto horarios y que los supervisores sean mas accesibles a las necesidades del agente.
good,"Offered a lot of overtime and work benefits are good management not to support local communications technician, a lot of things not known within the management and staff"
good,"It has turned into an atmosphere that promotes poor work quality with the expectation of a high return. There are too many variables outside of your control as an employee that affect your advancement in the company. When you say something about this they just tell you to ""control what you can control."" It's the biggest, I don't really care, and get paid a salary so your complaint doesn't pertain to my quality of life, answer you can get."
good,"The pay and benefits are nice. Scripted sales pitches that almost border on sounding a bit intrusive when a customer states they only wants specific service/s.The company has an alarming rate of attrition due to quota and inconsistent leadership support. My comment is specific to In bound sales and not necessarily a reflection of the company, at large"
good,Comcast is a decent place to work complimentry services are a plus & the paid time off as well gets very frustrating & some sups are very bad they have a great variety of shifts as well
good,This is a great place to work. The company provided a good work culture and promoted team environment. Great benefits and good compensation. 
good,"Comcast has a great compensation and benefits plan.  The pay starting off is decent and you can work your way up and also earn a commission.  The job is quick-paced, with constant change."
good,"Great work environment, lots of energy, and Supervisors were pretty cool and helpful. However, the pay wasn't enough for the things that are expected of you. Also, I enjoy being of service and offering great deals, instead of having to pressure existing customers who have already received several recent calls from us. "
good,"answering inbound calls for technical support. stressful non-supporting environment. definitely opportunities of advancement but its not what you know, its who. awesome benefits decent pay."
good,Some days may start with an outage. Once that outage is repaired you'll need to find a ticket to work. While working on that ticket another outage may occur or you may get an assignment from your sup. You would work like that until the shift is over.
good,On a day to day basses I performed duties on the fiber network. The flexibility was great to do the job in the workplace. The benefits  are great for a family.
good,"Its a good place to work. but it seems like nothing else matters, but the work. Technicians are expected to work long and odd hours. the company has great pay nonetheless."
good,This job will make you feel like you do not have a life outside of Comcast. Can be very stressful. Supervisors  is not on the same page as the other supervisors.
good,I was with Comcast for over 7 years. I was not familiar with call center environment. There was a lack of communication at times during management transition. It wasn't a bad job but just not what I wanted for a career choice.
good,"4 10 hour day Sunday thru Wednesday,company van ,tools and equipment ,  very stressful  environment trying to help unsatisfied customers,front line contact , so techs are first to here customer complaints, liked job i did , just all goals and requirements were getting hard to do and satisfy management"
good,"While working here as a technican assisant I met many great and dedicated people who worked here, but most of the managers would not listen to employee demands, such as making employees go out on multiple jobs at once (which is impossible to do), and giving random days off when everyone has already shown up for a class because they ""didn't know what to talk about that day""."
good,"The job itself was not horrible, but actually receiving pay for the hours worked on the other hand, was. I would recommend working for them, but be careful who you go through to do it."
good,"Comcast was fast paced and there wasn’t much family time due to work load. The training was great and the instructor was very knowledgeable concerning his craft. The job environment was fair. They do their best to prevent injuries, but due to the job load there’s not much really they can do about it. Whatever you do, don’t get injured because they really don’t do a good job with job reentries and they don’t have positions that translate into other opportunities. Also, they don’t do light duty for Techs."
good,"Comcast Loyalty was one the toughest Call Center experiences I've had due to the type of customer service needed.   Our Job was to deal with escalated calls, IE unhappy with their service, change of service etc.   Most calls were escalated calls and our job was to deescalate them while trying to sell additional services or promotions.    Very tough sell.   That being said if you were good at it the commission was great!"
good,"If you're already great at sales, then this is an awesome job - slow calls most of the time, easy customers to deal with, uncapped commission, and basically free service. The leadership is their negatives - You can do well on sales process scores, commissions, etc but if you don't do it the exact way *they* want you to do it, then you can get written up and fired pretty easily despite technically meeting expectations."
good,"The hardest part of this job is that we have metrics to meet each month. Although it has been very successful for me, I think that the prices for services are very expensive. In hindsight, it benefits the company however not the customer. I understand the logic behind it from a business prospective however as a customer, it doesn't benefit the callers if they are looking to save money. Not to mention, we do not have much to retain customers . I enjoy bringing pleasure and saving to my callers when ever I can. The most enjoyable part about this job, is the benefits and commission. I believe in working hard and being rewarded for it"
good,"Very good pay and commissions for those that work extremely hard and are able to develop an internal and external network of referral sources as soon as possible."
good,"The pay is good for the work that you do, however the management is all over the place and you are expected to be perfect. Also, outsourced reps will ruin accounts and cause massive issues that you are left to deal with."
good,"Typical work day is largely responding to customers concerns/query in a call center environment. While fast paced, the work environment is very casual. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with customers."
good,"My day consist of answering inbound calls for customers with issues to troubleshoot cable service also maintained customers billing accounts.  I also would up sale to customers which would provide additional income. I believe that I was very productive in this aspect."
good,"I was working in Tele-sales and it became unethical. You are pressured to meet a quota in order to make any money worth being there. So you have employees selling not just elder customers but all customers in general services that they do not need, which in turn causes them to have a bill they can not afford on a fixed income.  You have to have no moral compass in order to be successful in this position or have another job. Because you will not be able to make a living on this income alone without making a commission."
good,"a lot of work, you have to be a hard worker & dedicated. comcast has good benefits. the commute is the worse part of my job and not having enough people to do the work"
good,"this job was very fast paced and depended upon deadlines and being very, very particular when placing commercials on cable TV.  This department was deactivated and moved to Atlanta, GA."
good,"I was responsible for managing the entire sales team of outside sales reps, inside sales reps, sales support, and sales engineers in a positive and constructive manner so we could meet our sales goals."
good,"work hours were not conducive to a family life balance. Days ended after 7pm everyday. being in the field exposed to weather conditions effected moral and attitudes. "
good,A typical day at work was every beginning of the week we would go in and touch bases on what was going on in the company. We would then get our turfs and what numbers need to hit with certain products. I learned how door to door sales and other sales are different. I found out that these type of jobs are about what you have done for the company lately and not about if you sold them the most the month before. It isn't much job security no matter how long you have been with the company.
good,no comment i was laid off from this place it was kinda stressful especially since i was only 19 working and  it was my first real job. it was a good place overall but i wasn't ready back when i had it
good,"Pay is fair, people are great, collaborative environment.  Majority of managers are weak however and not good at grooming talent.  Difficult to move up as more and more are brought in from the outside.  Extremely matrixed organization with many decision makers."
good,"A typical day at Comcast is what the employee is going to make it. Attitude is the most important factor in this job because it is always changing. I was hired at a time of leadership change, so I didn't have a manager for my first three months. The manager I ended up having was still adjusting to the position as much as I was adjusting to mine. The culture of the workplace was very friendly and helpful. Everyone was intent on helping the next person succeed."
good,"I enjoyed this company because I was good at it , and I enjoyed talking to people both on the phone and in person. I did my very best and would go to other offices outside of my home office with just a phone call and the supervisor appreciated that."
good,"Good place to work, long hours plus mandatory weekend work. Independent work,  must be highly efficient with computers and technology (televisions, computers, telephone, internet, cable)"
good,"Comcast has a great, fast paced atmosphere, with good benefits. I would reccommend Comcast as a good place to work. The location is a little far for my liking, and the pay for the tasks we perform isn't really fair"
good,"Amazing employees, but when you need a schedule change unless you've been there for years, impossible. Amazing benefits, casual dress code, but management could be better"
good,"This is a numbers driven company with a bigtime disconnect from the field employees to management. Some things like the customers you deal with are beyond your control but you are blamed for there issues no matter what. If you have high stress in your life this place can certaily add to it. The supervisors run scared and place there stress on the workers."
good,"I started working at Comcast with the dream they sold me of all this money I can make and how easy it is to sell the product. Once I got in and started working, it was completely opposite. Commission was low and the sales practices were horrid. I also hated the fact of losing sells to online or third party dealers due to us not price matching. My manager was awesome and was always trying to help but as a whole, they need some work."
good,"It is an ok place to work, but I wanted more for myself. The job was stressful and full of people yelling at you all day on the phone. It was back to back calls all day and it was hard to think straight after being yelled at all day. Not all positions are like that."
good,A typical day at work first i am home dispatched.... we go to our service calls engage with customer all day.  attend meetings that are scheduled.all in all a good company
good,There is plenty of opportunity at Comcast. You must be willing to work hard and may need to relocate for additional advancement. However it's plenty to learn in many fields.
good,"They try to make it a ""fun"" environment.  However, it is a cut-throat sales environment. And hearing negative comments from the customer on just about every single call makes it difficult to up sale.  The top sales people do make $60-$80K per year but you have to work 10 hours days in order to get your commission up.  They deduct commission if you don't make a sale on each and every call.  For examples, if it was a tech call and you need to transfer the call to the tech department and you don't succeed on upgrading their current service before transferring the call, then that is a negative commission for you.  If it's a wrong number, it's a negative commission!  They punish you (on the commission) for something that you have no control over."
good,"The company itself is great. The benefits, the pay, it all added up.. The issues that myself and many different people where I worked had at the Sarasota office, was with the culture and values of upper management on a local level."
good,Management - needs help to support personnel in the trenches.  Give support to middle and personnel on the front line.   training is fragmented and lacks structure
good,"Working at Comcast gave me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during that time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are many ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree."
good,I learned a lot about working on computer and internet issue. I learned how to work with television issues. The hardest part of this job was having to sale product of serivce to customer and being penalized if it was not done.
good,"Comcast is great company to work for, however the shifts available are awful and everything is sort of backwards. They don't care to take care of the little guys in a sense and yet we are the people that fix everything and essentially make everything go round. The benefits are amazing but they limit how fast you can move up in the company which stinks because everybody learns and grows at a different pace. Hardest part of the job is being able to meet metrics, the more calls you take, the more sales you have to make. And if a customer is not happy with the company as a WHOLE and call back within a 7 day window it counts against you."
good,Don't ever think your next job is an easy one. before you know it you're there for 3 hours. You learn a lot and most often your team is pulling for you. don't ever be afraid to ask for help or say you don't know something.
good,"Receive many calls per day and sell all products."
good,A typical day at work consist of preparing yourself for the daily activities of being in the field. I've learned a lot about interpersonal communications. The hardest part of the job is staying consistent and keeping a good mentality throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
good,"The normal work day is 9 - 10 hours and approximately 50 hours per week. Big company with great name recognition, high attrition and frequent changes in management."
good,"Decent company to work for, very strict and uniform on quotas versus customer service. They are closed on major holidays, but retail sales stores must work (usually)."
good,"Workplace is fair with this company, but my experience with the company is at least over 15 years ago, so not sure if it has changed much. Fellow employees were enjoyable to work with though, no complaints in that area."
good,work days normally go smooth. since I've been there I learned how receive in shipments and also got my forklift certification. management was very poor. hardest part of the job is working with a supervisor who lacks communication.
good,Spent way more time working compared to what I was told in the interview. Schedules continuously changed every week. High sales goals. Continuous coaching and redundant meetings.
good,Typical day with meetings interacting with groups solving issues. There is the drive and goal for new technology and changes every day so it is a fast environment. Very Agile.
good,"same thing everyday come in and take calls"
good,Stressful with over 100 phone calls daily. You don't have time to use the restroom. The employees are very unhappy.  The work environment is completely dreadful.
good,While working for Comcast I had potentials to make great bonuses which help making our compensation package better.  The company culture was great and had a great team to work with.
good,"Excellent communication skills – written and oral"
good,"This job is extremely stressful! They put entirely too much pressure on employees on a daily basis to make sales daily. We cannot sell to someone who does not want the product, if the product isn't useful to them in any way or does not answer there phones. We have monthly goals to make, lets try focusing more on the monthly goal than the daily goals. Dress codes are enforced for a select type of people in the call center. If there's a dress code for everyone then enforce it on everyone and stop targeting certain people. There's more, but I'll save that for some other time. The main part about this job that I like is that I don't have to get up at the crack of dawn to get to work and I get off at a reasonable time. Telessales isn't for everyone."
good,"There police are really aggressive in this place. While there are a lot of benefits offered by this company, there are also a lot drawbacks. The metric in this place are crazy !!!!"
good,Management does not treat everyone equal. Unless you are part of the click you will never get a promotion. This pertains to my dept only as the other Managers seem to have no issue with treating everyone fairly and promoting someone when they feel they earned it.
good,Most of the time you are working on your own but lately they have been implementing new apps to structure your day the way they see fit. ALways overloaded at the end of the day with work
good,"Good company"
good,The job pays ok but is too stressful! The benefits have been one of the major reasons I have stayed there for two years. The job is ever-changing and these changes have impacted my commission tremendously.
good,"Advancement is tough at this work place, and any raises are on for me a very unbalanced evaluation system. I was raised only .12 (12 cents) in 3 years even after helping organize 3 other warehouses along with mine. The job in itself is not super stressful. Managing and controlling inventory. Delivering and picking up supplies. Upper management is often very non active or very uncaring."
good,"Extremely fast paced, not for everyone. I enjoy it, something different each day. Feeling of accomplishment and exceptional productivity at the close of each day."
good,"Great company to work for.  I gave 16 years of my life, I learned a lot, worked in several different departments.  I have seen many come and go, and a lot changes, however, over all a great place to work."
good,I've worked more than one position in Comcast and I loved it each time. The only complaint I had of course was the distance traveled to and from work but other than that it's a beautiful opportunity to advance.
good,"Comcast was enjoyable but they're very fast paced and constantly encouraging new ideas which is great for all employees. If you're seeking a company that isn't repetitive and embraces change, the C in Comcast is for change. Company motto."
good,"Comcast is a very fun and interactive call center to work in, there are so many advancement opportunities as long as you network and stick out and go above and beyond not only for your job but also for the company."
good,"Not a stressful place of employment. "
good,"Pay is ok the Management  is horrible and the work environment  is stressful."
good,"Could be silo'd and no forward advancements."
good,"Customer care support for Voip and High-Speed Internet"
good,You take numerous calls explaining client's bill invoice while also trying to upsell other products that the company offers. There is always something new to learn each day either with product knowledge or how to resolve a conflict. This is a very fast paced call center environment with diverse group of coworkers which is great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you did your best and great incentives/bonuses for a job well done.
good,"Typical day at consisted of going from job site to job site, trouble shooting and installing internet/phone/cable services.  I learned how to communicate with various customers using excellent customer service.  The job taught me how to work on my own in pressured situations and gave me freedom to work independently.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact between different types of customers and coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was working in extreme weather conditions."
good,"A typical day for me is go to neighborhood and canvas the area to promote cable, internet, home phone, and home security. The best part about this job is talking to all type of people in the communities. The culture here was like a family until corporate replace all the upper management. The hardest part about this job is management telling you what area when and where to work."
good,Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table and ping pong tournaments. Sales challenges every weeks. employee months with different food every day of that month.
good,"Great Company, processes are a mess. Trying to fix them is a nightmare. If you like a challenge then Comcast is for you. Management has no clue. The pay is excellent!"
good,"I was responsible for directing technicians to jobs in their area,"
good,"Decent working environment.  Friendly people, management focused on directive goals.  Training was minimal.  Did not work with co-workers that much as I ran reports for co-workers to be able to perform their jobs.  The hardest part of this job was technology in the manner that my computer was slow on the network, with no true reason identified.  Comcast was flexible as a company to allow for personal appointments when necessary."
good,"""Scorch the Earth"" sales strategy. The sales people are constantly stepping on each others territories. AVOID this company if possible."
good,People work here at Comcast to ensure great customer service experience for clients internally as well as externally. It is place where creativity is valued.
good,"stressful work place. does not replace help for the work load. supervisors are not all that knowledgeable for the position. the work load is manageable but not for everyday. change is everyday, not a problem but need to be notified before change takes place"
good,"The environment was fast paced and detailed orientated. Advancement was lacking and was promised only to be removed."
good,Monthly quota with cold calling and door knocking. Free to manage your day as you feel is most productive. Inter-company competition can make the job difficult.
good,Great company while there . wish I would have stayed and given more time I think they value the internal candidates more than external like some companies
good,Typical days would include but limited to a morning meeting discussing best sales practices and numbers. From there you report to the field to generate cold leads to sales.
good,"I have only good things to say about Comcast/Xfinity. They're pay is average in most locations but can be challenging in a small market."
good,"Job was great, a lot to learn and take away. Healthy work environment, down to earth management team and dedicated team members. Daily work consisted of helping customers and troubleshooting to de-escalate customers need."
good,at the time there were too many changes in management and that was a huge factor. minus that it may have been a great place to work
good,"t is a good job, but there is no movement. It doesn't matter how hard you work you will get treated the same as some one who really couldn't care about the work they do."
good,i enjoyed my overall job tough me a lot in collections that i learned to love team lead was amazing at criticism was straight forward but never put you down just gave you ideas and pointers on how to excel this job had some of the worst people in control as far as department management and some team leads where horrible but they did have great trainers and some team leads actually where there to help you grow
good,"I was only at this job for a short time and it was in their call center. They offered a lot of perks like free lunches, free cable service, and different promotional gifts."
good,"install repair cable services"
good,great job if you are a self starter and highly motivated.  Management in certain offices leaves a lot to be desired though.  Absolutely worth your time to investigate a career there
good,"Spent 13 years working for them in various capacities. Worked in the field at two locations as a technician for first year and a half then eleven + in two call centers. During that time I saw a lot of changes. Some good and some not. High turnover. Toughest thing was providing good quality customer service because of lack of training and enough tools at your disposal to assist customers. Company had a perception that they were providing great service. Comcast management realized based on responses from employees that it was frustrating and possessed limited abilities to succeed. They have since changed their policies, procedures and expectations for call center representatives."
good,it is ok fun enviornment people are nice managemnt is horrible and attendance policy is not family friendly so if you have little kids that are constantly sick i would not reccommend working here
good,"The job changed a lot once they changed our commission structure. They brought our sales goals up and started paying us less. Once that happened the moral of everyone in the store dropped tremendously. The day to day is easy enough. Customers come in for a few issues IE billing, technical, sales. We assist with all of those."
good,"A typical day was to see how many trouble calls or installations I would need equipment for. Then I would go to a subscribers residence at the scheduled time and repair or install their requested service. I mainly worked alone, so the only interaction with other employees was during the time at the office in the mornings or when management had meetings. The hardest part of the job was working in crawl spaces or dealing with angry customers, but the customers were probably the easier of the two to deal with."
good,Nice interesting job that makes you think quick on your feet would only recommend for people with the correct schedule I learned internet phone and cable among other things and established work relationships that will last forever
good,The company itself is a great company to work for they could not treat there employees any better. You just have to get used to bill collecting
good,"Could make money, also learned a lot about how cable works, very structured organization. Also would receive free cable, phone, and internet without any caps on data. Hddvr boxes were also available"
good,"I enjoyed working, it's just that some of the supervisors are extremely uncooperative when it comes to assisting. The pay is great if you don't mind the constant change and inconsistencies."
good,"Fun place to work, great work/life balance. The Comcast culture encourages growth and creativity, and the team members are dedicated and reliable."
good,"As a Sr. Event Specialist, my role was productive an exciting. I was able to gain experience in the marketing aspect of my ole, as well as maintain customer loyalty through assisting a sales team. Utilizing Market Research and demographics was key in having successful events."
good,"It is a good company but nothing exciting about working there. "
good,Not to Diversed in the area  I work in very long work hours slow to no advancement in the office i work Ive learned to complete work in a timely maner
good,Exciting and challenging. New technologies and progressive environments. Cutting edge system designs and good collaboration.
good,very disorganized culture. management is poor. favors internal fiinancial management leadership candidates xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xxx xxx
good,"The company seems to be an ok company, but in the Business Sales department it felt like there was no coaching and support and enough time given for people to learn their jobs. The Sales department continues to be a revolving door and will always be unless they change their support structure and stop focusing so much on the numbers"
good,I enjoyed working here until it became apparent that all our jobs were being outsourced.  Good location and great benefits.
good,"Typical day at Comcast is support, coach and engagement of call center staff to ensure customer service excellent is achieved on a daily basis."
good,Typical Day is coming in starting at 7:30am getting together with team to review morning huddle. The morning huddle is a short team meeting where we review our goals for the day as well as any new updates. After we go out and prepare for the day by gathering out batches for payments and such. Throughout the day we deal wit a lot of customers whom have questions issues concerns.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time with Comcast. Most days were very busy with little time for anything besides actual work. This included training, performance reviews and even company mandated items. The pay and benefits were very good, but the work level was so high that it leads to a really high burnout rate."
good,"Purchasing was an additional responsibility I took on in addition to the Accounting Coordinator position I was already doing."
good,"Hard to have a life/work balance"
good,"Poor management during acquisition."
good,Comcast sales technique I learned that helped me a lot in my professional side and believe going to help me more during my life.
good,"*Create and execute basic sales/mktg plans"
good,"Did installation of cable, phone, and internet the last four years. Before that i did cable and phone construction projects."
good,"Definitely keeps you busy throughout your shift, benefits are great and so are your co workers. hardest part as an technician was the pressure from supervisors to give thorough service in short amount of time, also those days with bad weather and you still had many jobs to catch on time. best part is if the day was slow you can possibly leave a few mins before your shift for an early arrival home."
good,Its billed as a great place to work. Its good not great. I would not recommend it unless you can deal with a lot of pressure from customers and employers.
good,"Very fast paced and a significant amount of  multitasking and correlating with supervisors as needed. Everyday was different, but that is expected in a large company. It is all about change and you were expected to change with it or get left behind."
good,i enjoy working for a Company that cares about their employees as well as provides the tools to help their employees succeed and grow within the company.
good,"Nice facility to work in."
good,"Job turned into sales and commission was mainly sales based. Turnover for employees is too high"
good,"Comcast had a decent pay package with excellent benefits. Pay was increased based off performance metrics, which were difficult but obtainable. My direct managers were professional and terrific, however, not all were as proficient. Job consisted of defusing angry customers and solving technical difficulties over the phone in order to prevent the need for an on-site technician. Verbal abuse occurred daily by clients, which meant that in order to succeed you must have a strong character and the ability to realize that the clients problems are not directed at you personally, but rather at the frustration of not having what was expected available."
good,"As the saying goes, ""Faster faster be a Comcaster"""
good,"They don't like to pay you for the work you've done, no consistency/follow through on pay promises. no bueno. There's not much room to advance. The call center environment is so draining and they are police about time management down to the second (running reports hourly) If you don't like being micromanaged, don't apply here."
good,comcast over all is a great people to work. but the co work and management very depend were you are working. you can have a great location where everyone want to work hard play hard. want to grow with company and give great customer service and then you will have another location that dont and are all about self not the customer or the team.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"the job is not hard, but when you need help, its almost an act of congress to get management to help you. And in the sales team it is unfair, they only give guaranteed sales to the top sellers and give the undecided market to the lesser sales agents."
good,"Comcast is a technology company and they are growing and expanding daily.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at Comcast. A typical day consisted of installing cable, phone, and internet (residental/commerical)."
good,people i worked with were great but management left alot to be desired. job was not difficult or demanding. management lacked concern for customers.
good,"Answering billing questions for customers, making a daily sale goal, and trouble shooting equipment. I learned how to be very patience with customers. Co worker were really friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job was to sale to angry customers. the most enjoyable was selling to those angry customers."
good,"call-center job."
good,"Very fast paced, ever changing environment. Coworkers were fun to work with, and helped with keeping the stress level to a minimum. We were performance based and urged to remain customer focused, and empower ourselves while complying with company M&P's. Base salary was low, and non negotiable, although some of the benefits were useful."
good,IT positions are limited regarding career growth. Plenty of work to do for the company supporting IT related issues. A good team environment.
good,Great place to work with excellent benefits. Lacks family flexibility. Great pay with excellent co workers. Stressful place with customers calling in and being very rude at times. You must have a tolerance for rude people and be able to handle a high call volume.
good,Work to help advance the sales team and learn along the way. It is highly structured and organized. Heavy emphasis on service and innovation. A good place to work.
good,"This was a far cry from the worst place I've ever worked. The hours were ok but, many times long hours were required for the same amount of pay. The direct management was good but, communication between departments was nearly nonexistent. Its a good job if your sales numbers never dip below company standards. I was required to take quite a bit of verbal abuse from former and current customers."
good,Great Place to work. Always busy with something to do. Great co- workers and management.
good,Comcast is a great place to work and it has great job security my only problem with this job is sometimes you will work more than you are off work. its not great balance between work and home.
good,"Typical day at work and skills gained: Over the phone sales, Door to door sales, installation in repair"
good,I ran a service/instalation route. I learned alot about computers and the internet. Management could use an improvement. Enjoyed the people i worked with plus being able to meet to customers daily.
good,"•	Responsible for the fiscal and operational execution of large cross-functional infrastructure programs with annual budgets that range from $25-$75M, which are a significant contributor to Comcast’s $5B video line of business."
good,"Lots of earning potential due to hourly rate plus commission, call center environment, I learned to provide excellent customer service to even the most unreachable customers through patience. Co-workers were great to work hand and hand with. Hardest part of the job was being recognized or to stand out in a call center of 500+ agents. Most enjoyable part of my workday was having great customers who knew what they wanted."
good,This is a good job if you like to be micro managed. If you like to be on the phone 24/7 then its the job for you. You do get lot of work benefits. The schedule is a little demanding no working around your schooling.
good,"Customer Focus "
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to gain a substantial amount of commission added to the hourly pay. Benefits are nice. Management is mildly thorough. Work environment was busy and could get overwhelming at times but I have experienced worse.
good,The hardest part of the job was being micro managed all the time
good,Is long work hours single parents are not taken in consideration when it comes to working hours
good,"My manager is one of those types that is very angry the one minute but totally fine the next. Can be somewhat difficult to work with. Most of my co-workers are knowledgeable, and very intuitive and willing to help when help is needed. The most difficult part of the job is bad customers, and my PMS supervisor. The best part of it is the independence and meeting awesome customers. Typical day, get your work orders in the morning, drive to them, solve any issues, or conduct an install, replace the drop if necessary and any fittings, move onto the next one. I did not much care for the mid-day schedule though."
good,"It depends on project to project but most of the time would be spend in development activities."
good,"the company is a great company to work for, however unless you are based at the corporate office, the opportunity to advance is very slim."
good,"Answer inbound calls for customers inq about bill and payments "
good,"A typical day at work included reviewing all pending repair tickets, responding to any necessary email, communicating directly with customers via telephone to obtain further information or inform them of a resolution, document in detail all steps taken to resolve issues.  The most difficult part of the job was lack of creativity, or the ability to be creative in my position.  However, working in a predominantly team oriented environment created strong bonds amongst co-workers and allowed for more effective, prompt resolutions."
good,handled calls that where 30-60 day past due on there credit card payment
good,"Overall the company is great but the metric systems ""needs serious work""."
good,"A typical day at Comcast was about great customer experience in billing issues, payments, helping the customer to get the best service and product needs for they're cable, internet and phone needs.  I learned how to adapt to many changes within the company.  Co-workers become like family. Quick to help each other on the job. I think the hardest part of the job was some the product sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a customer leave with a smile knowing that they're needs or concerns have been taken care of."
good,"work non- stop from the time i got to work @3:30am till 12:30pm. I learn at lot about the cable/internet and phone service, customer service for internal and external customers. I work with a great group of people, the hardest part of my jobs was when I had to crush the numbers for the daily quota, the techs vacation schedule and daily work schedule but I loved every minute of it."
good,"The work can be hard sometimes but mostly it is rountine. Our moto is ""have fun"""
good,Typical day at work requires A lot of strategy and positivity when it comes to handling customer complaints and being the last department that customers speak to. Co-workers make the job more easier due to team that we are placed on. The hardest part would be loosing customers due to bad experiences they may have had with other representatives.
good,Got the chance to showcase my sales and customer service skills. Learned management and people skills.
good,"I had a lot of training classes on line. My typical day  was arrival 30 minutes early. Get prepared  setting up computer monitors and applications. Greet co-workers and supervisors and mentally prepare to overcome obstacles of my tasks at hand."
good,"Comcast was a great place to work in the beginning. Great Benefits, Great Pay and tons of great people to work with. The toughest part about my time there was the lack of support. Supervisors rarely provided the help that was needed to succeed, leaving agents to fend for themselves. The training was also not quite up to par. The company would fly in trainers from different regions of the country and they would train us the way they did things in their region instead of the things that we needed to know according to our location which led to a lot of misinformation and poor training."
good,it was an overall nice place to work for other than consistency playing a major role with any questions you need answered.
good,"I worked in both the call center and the warehouse, 4  years in the former, 14 months in the latter.  Co workers on the whole in both places were very positive and enjoyable to work with, I in fact still have communication with a couple of them today.  Management in both cases on the whole could be difficult to work with.  They, in both the warehouse and the call center were more concerned with the results then the challenges in the different policies and set up of each place (expectations given the working conditions) that made the results in each place difficult if not impossible to achieve.  Hardest part of the call center was the philosophy ( un stated) was get them on, get them off (efficient calls, short as possible call times) where mine, again was customer satisfaction completely, no matter how long that took. Tried to be the last person the customer needed to be transferred to.  That was the tough part. Enjoyable were my team mates. In the warehouse, About 6 months in, an employee separated from the company. It was , by nature and definition, given the daily tasks and warehouse size, a two person operation,  Hard to do with one person but that is what management expected. This was the hardest part of that job, enjoyable were the employees with whom I was privileged to interact"
good,"Basically taken care of answering any questions for the customer, educating the customer on any cost or rates of comcast that my have changed or will be changing. Answer all calls, transfer any calls. "
good,"I always got along with co workers "
good,"Answered phone calls"
good,"overall, it depends on if you l are an exceptional people person. if you can't handle rejection very well, then this job is definitely not for you..."
good,"A typical day at Comcast is answering calls all day for customers that either have continuous problems or just want to call and complain. My co-workers are ok, the job is not hard just gets frustrating when the systems are always crashing. I enjoy my job when me and my work friends are having a good time with each other. Management is ok, really no help there but it's management, cant really expect too much."
good,"Poor to Customers"
good,"It's long commute to work however we work during normal business hours 8:00 AM -4:00 PM, learned lots of cutting edge technologies, BPM, Weblogic, Hadoop, Oracle ESB, EAI pattern (please check resume), good management & a wonderful techie team."
good,A typical day is  going over a customer bill the hardest part is went I cannot solve a customer problem. on the first  phone call. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is when I can solve a customer problem .
good,"On a day to basis with Comcast, I knocked on doors in several different neighborhoods. I would sale all the company's products like cable, phone, and internet. I mainly liked all the different challenges I faced by the days because it gave me the opportunity to overcome each and every one of them. I just felt like the company itself didn't do a good job with helping us Sale Reps adapt to all the changes they were making to the products which led to us giving misleading information to the customers."
good,"Comcast is a good place to work, they just need a better training system."
good,This is a difficult review to give. I Lost my job with Comcast as a result of the most horrible experience of my life. I was a victim of a house fire which left me and my three children homeless for a little more than a month. As a result to this I was unable to adhere to their attendance policy. My co-workers were great for the most part. The hardest part of the job was being told you are going to be a customer service rep. then once you are in training you are told this is as equally a sales position. The company completely misrepresent the employment positions available and the products to their customers and/ or prospects.
good,"Great hands on experience and training was to a ""T"". Although, compensation should be increased for techs in the field due to working conditions."
good,"A typical day consisted of angry callers calling about either their bills, service,or a combination of the two. I learned that Comcast doesn't do a whole lot to resolve technical issues for customers except for to ""send signals"" to boxes and send technicians out repeatedly and ignore the real problems that exist with old lines. Management was friendly. Co-workers were also friendly and fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was setting up new service and learning the way the software that Comcast uses to set up service for a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers and the atmosphere overall."
good,"Comcast VSD SSD Engineer since February 2013. I have worked for Comcast since 1996 where I started as a field engineer working on Coaxial/Fiber residential plant. I transitioned into a network monitoring roll in 2001 utilizing network tools to support technicians in the field as well as performing preventive measures to avoid major outages to customers. In 2009, I became a XOC HFC Supervisor which I managed a team of 18 performing network monitoring duties. In 2010, an opportunity presented itself to work more directly with servers, switches & routers also continuing to perform network monitoring responsibilities with the XOC NSD team. I have always enjoyed learning new skills and appreciate the value it brings to an employee in the business of broadband."
good,"My typical day at work starts with reviewing emails, coaching agents to better thier performance, take live phone escalations, call back customers who requested a supervisor, call reviews, payroll processing, and pulling daily reports. This is just the surface there are lots of other duties that I complete on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.The most enjoyable part of my job is teaching, coaching and developing agents to better themselves."
good,You get to work get 10 minutes to turn on computer and pull up systems. You are on the phone 2 hrs before your first break. I get a half hour lunch halfway through my shift and get a 2nd 15 minute break 2 hrs before end of shift. Once every two weeks I have a coaching with my supervisor which isn't too bad and once every other week we have a team meeting to make sure we are all on the same page.  My co workers are the best part of the job besides the unlimited overtime and benefits. I learned some in training but once your out of training everything is completely different. The hardest part of the job is following the rules from management which pretty much is that quantity of calls means more than quality.  It's sad to say that but it seems like they care about you meeting stats rather than if your first call resolution and voice of customer are great.
good,"Answer a call discuss customer's likes and dislikes get to know the customer and provide them with the services to meet their needs.  Learned how to read from a script and be personable at the same time.  Strict Management. Co-workers are Robots. Hardest part of my Job is keeping up with the stats, making sure everyone is honest and not steeling my sales, and keeping positive everyday.   Thank goodness God is close by my side.  Seeing the few Coworkers that are left."
good,"Early in the morning you have to pickup your workload."
good,Comcast provides an interesting and dynamic work environment. The workload is interesting. Development might be slower than desired. Courtesy Services is a great perk.
good,Day consisted of checking in at office then hitting the road for door to door sales of cable products
good,Inbound call center (virtual). Everyday is pretty much the same you log on and talk. The metrics (goal) can be hard to hit sales and schedual and call availability. Hardest part of the job is the customer abuse.
good,"Smart Senior Leadership that has a keen focus on continuously moving the company forward for the future.  Aggressive in pursuing new business opportunities (i.e. NBC Universal acquisition, Verizon partnerships, etc.).  Financially it is a very strong company.  They need to put more focus on creating better customer experiences particularly over the phone and get back to building a positive environment for the employees."
good,"Productive and a fun place to work with a pool table, video games, internet to surf on breaks and lunch..."
good,A day long of processing and meeting new vendors and workers.
good,"Provide over the phone Helpdesk support for Comcast"
good,"I didn't like management when I worked for Comcast. They only cared about how much you could sell, and the metrics are out of touch with reality. I worked in an area that took over for Time Warner Cable. I noticed that Time Warner was cheaper, and Comcast's price was a lot higher. (Time Warner even had multi-room dvr's) It was hard to work there after I saw the difference in prices and no difference in service. Comcast's doesn't put enough money back in the products, multi-room dvr's are way over due with Comcast. In my area they don't offer that service, but my prices keep rising. I brought this up to them many times as an employee and they don't listen. I even brought up some ideas about the IVR system. They will never have a JD and Power Associates Award if they don't start listening to customers, and employees."
good,"Performing complex calls including billing, complaints, sales and installation"
good,-Easy work
good,Very fast paced environment with multiple challenges that are met each day.
good,"I woke up at 0500 to be ready to leave for my first job by no later than 0715. I would stock up my equipment, conduct inventory every morning, and clean out my vehicle. I would have anywhere between four to eight houses to troubleshoot or install equipment. I would have to certify every house for correct signal strength and craftsmanship."
good,"its a good job, but they are not willing to work with your schedule (i.e. school, family)"
good,"A typical work day consists of greeting Comcast customers new and current. Either installing cable, internet, or phone service in their home or business, or diagnosing what kind of problems they have been having with there service and repairing it. Duties include climbing up to 32 ft ladders on telephone poles, running cable and phone lines in homes, going into attics, crawl spaces, and measuring downstream and upstream signal levels on the cable lines. Calculating signal loss over distance on frequencies to help determine trouble areas or bad lines. Co-workers are awesome. Great people who are willing to help you out if you are in need of it while in the field. The hardest part of the job is having to work outdoors in diverse weather condition. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers. Whether that be, getting their services started with an install and showing them the cool features that are offered to them or by fixing a problem they have been experiencing. Seeing the satisfaction on their face is the best part."
good,Lots of hard work but excellent pay and benefits. Supervisors could be better. Overall its a great company to work for until you get hurt on the job!
good,Comcast is always seeking and growing in the entertainment technology arena
good,"a typical day at work was taking inbound phone calls, making sure all customers questions have been answered and making sure you kept all quota up."
good,"I was lucky enough to have a great set of coworkers here as well. This job involved mostly customer service where I was able to assist clients with internet services (signup, troubleshooting and terminations). I also assisted with cable services as well."
good,"sit at work stations and work on an outbound project. I have also work on inbound projects. Everyday I learn how to deal with customers in different ways, whether they have billing issues, service issues, or just want to know about our prices and installation.Management is helpful if our computers go down, they also help us with our PTO.my co-workers make it very enjoyable to come to work everyday, we encourage each other to make sales and we even sometimes have a competition going to see who can make the most sales in one day. The hardest part of the job is sometimes trying to explain to customers what services they ordered and what equipment they need to get the most out of their services. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that once you have met the customer needs they leave the line with a good feeling and that the customer is satisfied with the customer service they received."
good,"I loved my job, however it was outsourced to Costa Rica."
good,"take inbound calls solved billing issues, customer service, and technical support to customers having telephone, internet and phone issues"
good,"There are many pros and cons to working for Comcast. They have multiple offices located within the PA/DE/NJ tri-state area, so there are many positions you can apply for. Plus the partnership with NBC Universal opens up possibilities into the media field. You receive the Cable TV and High Speed Internet for relatively free. The initial days off given to new employees is generous. As a company they do try to cultivate a culture of charity with Comcast Cares Days and multiple charity drives throughout the year."
good,"Great technology, great products. However, in order for this company to provide a more competitive service, they need to hire better quality people and increase their wages."
good,"I believe that this is a good company to work for there are great benefits,perks and compensation.The downfall is the travel and turnaround of employees"
good,"Comcast being a leader in the home entertainment industry is constantly growing. Change is constant. As a result success required flexibility and being open to learn. Mnagement was a part of the team and at th same time a beacon that lead to companies ideal of success. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable. When I face that momentary peropd of uncertainty with this different symptom, unusual failure, or even difficult costomer. These situations also ushered to solutions and feelings of and indeed the completion of our tasks, victory, success."
good,Interacts with customers via telephone on a daily basis. Can take up to 100 calls in an 8 hour shift. Troubleshoot TV and internet issues.
good,I like the workers but the job is not where i want to be at this point. I have worked there for 9+ years but I am unqualified to move elsewhere in the company.
good,"The sales position used to be a great job, if you don""t mind working long hours, which is fine with me. More sales = more pay. Ideal for me. But the entire remuneration package changed recently. Reduced salary by $12K, reduced commissions, raised quotas by 20%, eliminated retention bonus and sick/personal days off. All in all, my income dropped by $32K. Ouch. They've lost 50% of the sales force since. No surprise."
good,There is a lot of turnover and high expectations but overall it is a good company to work for.
good,I took this job right out of college to have as a source of income until I found a better postion
good,During the day I receive about 40-50 calls. Most calls are about a technical issue. Most of the issues have 1 to 2 fixes over the phone the most common are the errors with the codes on the account. The hardest part is explaining to the customer what is happening with a there accounts and how to resolve it. The best part of my day is when i get to go home and relax.
good,Receive incoming calls and answer questions about bills and services.Hardest part of job is dealing with irrate customers but with help of supervisors we always solve customer issues.
good,"Comcast as a whole is a good company. The pay they offer is good, the benefits and perks are great, but the CAE position itself for technical support is the worst experience I have had at a job. The stress level is high, the job itself constantly changes focus, they were pushing to turn tech support into sales. You were randomly thrown in the Cable TV call queue (something we were never trained for) randomly without warning."
good,"The work day is ok, the only complaint would be that you are never appreciated"
good,The position involved a lot with sales and it seemed stressful. I did not get past the training session due to personal issues so I can't really speak on the full aspects of the job.
good,Great company with benefits. Always busy. You should stay aware of changes & growth. Opportunities are there if you stay aware & grow your skills & knowledge.
good,Comcast is a good company for long term employment. Trained skills can be obtained at this company.
good,"My biggest complaint is the lack of customer care after the sale and the lack of investment in training the technicians. Often products are developed and launched, but the roll-out and training to the sales team and the technicians is limited at best."
good,"impossible goals, poor training, middle management has no idea how to do your job but their book says your doing it wrong. all marketing directed to call centers that will do everything they can to steal your leads and sales. the comp plan seems nice, but you will probably never make the goal."
good,Comcast helps with United Way which is a great feeling of giving back to the community.  I volunteer and give back to those that are less fortunate.   I work side by side with my co-workers and we have a great culture with United Way. E
good,Comcast has a friendly informal working environment which enables the employee to feel comfortable. It is a place where everyone is on a first name basis and they are willing to support career growth.
good,"Comcast gets very different reviews from every department. They have very good benefits for individuals or for families. If you stay with them long team, the compensations is fair."
good,"Its a good company for those who don't won't to advance or be contempt at being in the same position the length of time that you are there. Comcast has great benefits and start you off with 2 weeks vacation, PTO and flex."
good,"The environment at the store is great, but the company as a whole is too cooperate based.  They set goals for us as reps, then they would make drastic changes to the pricing or structure of customers services without a good heads up.  They would raise the price while raising our goals.  Overall the nuclear store experience is great, but Comcast as a company is only focused on making the most money it can and everything else gets put on the back burner."
good,"had very nice people to work with, was a good place to work at. had family emergency leave. but would work here again. other then that comcast was a good job"
good,The hardest part of  the job is working out a situation where it is almost impossible to bring a line into the customer backyard with out injuring yourself and and to do it safely
good,Best training that I every received at a call center. Once your on the floor you are almost always supported. The people on the phone stress you out because they are stressed otherwise you can help them calmly if they are patient with you.
good,"Great benefits, numerous tools to manage work-life balance, very competitive pay.  Fun place to work at times. Very competitive,higly stressful, numbers driven environment."
good,"7+ weeks of training with commission bonuses. "
good,"The overall experience working for Comcast was great. There are some issues though. You have to be prepared for lack of communication, little help from staff, and angry customers."
good,I really enjoyed working for Comcast . The hours where great and the management where kind and fair. I personally just needed more room for advancement on my individual performance not as a team effort that’s my review thanks
good,The organization should be more competitive with its pay structure. A large organization should focus on what drives it buisness and pay accordingly. I did enjoy the job.
good,"They consolidated call center in St. Paul with center in Houston.  Offered SOME employees the opportunity to move to Houston ( gave 2 weeks to decide, must be relocated in 5 weeks), or upskill to a different, commission based position. 250+ to be laid off.  This comes 8 months after a shift bid that caused 70% of employees to alter lives due to changing schedules.  Employees who will be laid off December 14th (Merry Christmas!) now have to watch employees from a different department move into the office while we're dead men (and Women) walking.  Shame on you!"
good,I worked for this company back in 1998 through 2003 in the administrative Department love the company loved how it treats the employees the benefits are amazing and it's a company that is going places. I left for a period of and came back in 2015 and I've been there ever since a lot has changed and it is extremely stressful constant change and growth in the company but great benefits benefits
good,"I really loved my job. Then it changed, the job description I was sold turned out to be a lie. I am still employed but am currently looking outside the company"
good,Job doesn't leave you much time for home life. You work 10 hour days and most days the work you are giving is for 12+ hours.  You constantly deal with unreasonable customers. Your goals are difficult to achieve and changing all the time.
good,The hardest part of the job was the sales quota you needed to meet.  Management always helped you to be your best and help you achieve your goals. Getting a day off was impossible.
good,"Typical day is working your new leads and following up on current projects.  Update data bases with all current updates.   Schedule all conference calls and set the correct expectation of the customer first time talking with them, so that the project is off to a great start."
good,CSA Tech II handles emails and phones. Suspending and activating email accounts as needed. Educating customers on certain warnings they received via mail or email.
good,"working for this company was not that bad, benefits were really good and the job was not that stressful day to day. Management were pretty fair as long as your metrics were good and if you did  what you supposed to do."
good,"They will track you every step, micromanaging are crazy and ridicules. You will deal with very upset people who hate cable company and they rates. Compensation and advancement very good. Overall good place to work for,but you will feel like a lab rat under microscope."
good,"comcast is a fast pace job to were calls are back to back all day. like average 15 sec between calls. management is great, fully supportive and flexible with time off. The job is very easy and not challenging. the hardest part about this job, is having to go from one call to being yelled at and hung up on, to another and having to put a smile on you're face, typically over stuff we as customer service representatives have no control over. although metrics are easily achieved, this job is for someone who doesn't take things personal and forgive and forget instantly. benefits are AMAZING but will cost you."
good,"It definitely has the downs of retail. High expectations of fixing long term issues. There are easier ways of fixing internal issues but they like to function the hard way. The team I had motivated me on a daily basis to hit goals and to keep my head up. There are good things about Comcast like benefits, chances to advance, and awesome coworkers. But there's a lot they need to changes"
good,Comcast over all is a fantastic place to work at and develop customer services skills. I definitely would say it's not for everyone but for the right person you can go very far financially. Comcast helped me pay off a lot of my school debt and I'm very thankful for that.
good,"A typical work day was sitting on the phone taking calls.  hardest part was getting customers to follow directions when fixing there service. And getting them off the phone in a timley manner. "
good,"Working for Comcast Spectacor part time. Fun working culture, nice people to work with, hour varies often, depending on the events. Management and pay rate could have been a little better."
good,"a typical day is depending on what the job is..."
good,I worked for this company for 15 years and they provide the best benefits and perks and employee. I enjoyed my years there and met a lot of lifelong friends
good,"Start late ended late! Door knocking a priority, monitored scheduled for quota of knocks and sales attainment. Steady place with help and time off to keep a great work life balance. The weather is a factor with a lot of rain and some snow. Contests had awesome prizes given out. I felt like I was given a flexible schedule and yet it felt like someone was looking over my shoulder too!"
good,I loved the customer service part.  But the sales were hard and unethical. Our sales quota for Xfinity Home services were unrealistic with our community needs
good,"Comcast has a self service tool that allows the company to be as hands off as possible.They let you enter time for you work and set up all your own benefits, direct deposit, etc etc. the tech culture is buddy buddy as far as advancement in the company goes you need to be close with management and local supervisor. Techs in my office would gossip and complain about things that were not in there control  like a customers account being overdue and not wanting to go to the job because it wasn't paid on time. Not being able to get in touch with a local manager to make a complaint about another tech or supervisor. long story short if you like working in a environment when the people you work with absolutely dread their jobs, complain and gossip all day everyday. Then a Comcast tech is the job for you. As far as the upper echelon of the company I would have no comment."
good,"Comcast isn't available in Ohio to offer discounts to me, but I was able to move in with mom and care while my step-dad went to work during the week.  I was able to fix breakfast and lunch for her.  Get her water or milk and cookies.  Step-dad handled dinner.  Mom lasted 4 years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  Doctors only expected 6 months.  I loved being able to care for her for as long as I did."
good,"I worked in tech support for TV service, customers can be rude and nasty but not all, almost every phone position at Comcast required you to sale products, even though customers were calling in complaining their current services weren't working SMH"
good,"Comcast Spotlight - structured, routine, not too much stress. Can move up if you network with the right people in the right departments aggressively. Basically free cable."
good,I liked working for Comcast when I first started but Comcast has gone down the hill in the last 2-3 years. I think alot of poeple would agree with me. They fired alot of great people and hired some not so great idiots.
good,a lot of appointment that you need to go in order to finish your shift and do the job. sometimes its very difficult to get to one point to another point. any you may stay over time
good,Trying to provide customer service while trying to collect money.  Not real true advancement.  Looking elsewhere to obtain better opportunity and benefits
good,"I really enjoyed my co-workers, the managers made the enviorment fun and tried to keep the customer services reps hype and updated on all changes made within the company."
good,"Good work environment. limited opportunity for advancement at local site. Good management. Supervisors manage team, coach kpi metrics, have weekly meetings with their employees. hold agents accountable when need be"
good,"Comcast offer great benefits and a good culture. However, career advancement and pay could use some work. After being in the role for a couple years, you start to lose motivation because of management. It is not a long term place in my opinion"
good,"My job encompasses EVERY position in the company as a Senior Sales Exec. I run everything from Sales, to Billing and customer services, and because I am in tune with past, and current technologies, I also am the go to for tech based questioning at my location. Unfortunately, we have gone through several management changes in my location, with very different management styles which at times leaves us a bit confused about policies and procedures, however things should get better with time. The culture is very diverse and inclusive which is the most enjoyable part of the job, however nothing about my job is hard other than having customers swearing at you and think that its perfectly fine to do so in a public environment."
good,Job can be very stressful. There are resources available to help you. Management takes time to make sure you have everything you need to do your job. Excellent benefits and pay.
good,"Great benefits. Great people to work with. "
good,"Great work environment,  co workers are pleasant and warm. Can always rely on my team if I ever need assistance and are very family oriented. We find fun things to do with our GPTW committee to show appreciation to co workers  with food,snacks, and prizes on holidays and special occasions."
good,"Comcast was is a great company, however the demand to sell became overbearing. The Supervisors were supportive, however the stress to sell was very. Advancement was competitive"
good,It was fun working at Comcast. It was most of the time busy sometimes there will be dead days. If you like doing sales and commission work and working with the public and discussing their bills along with trying to convince them WHY Comcast is the better cable company than the other competitors.
good,It went from a sales role from technical support took a huge pay cut  from the position not be able to move up as quickly as I was told I will and was hindered from applying myself
good,"I think this job is a serious one but there seems to be a lacking attitude from management on down. I take things serious. When it comes to system outages, consumer issues, or just the simple I can handle attitude I take that in stride. The company as a whole would be a lot better if we hired men and women like me outside of the badges and degrees I feel like we should look deeper than the superficial information."
good,"Exciting place to work, great services, good support, terrible instalers, worses mid level management, nauseating supervisors. You have to suffer to do your job in a clean honorable way."
good,"Very classic work culture, nothing to complain about but nothing overwhelming. Overall people seem happy here. Work balance is fairly standard with many people seeming satisfied."
good,Overall great colleagues. Management can be detached from the expectations given. Very low starting pay and pay advancement doesn't keep up with cost of living. The 401k match was just increased back to the amount it was cut from ten years ago. Good healthcare benefits.
good,"Interesting place...."
good,"learn how to trouble shoot equipment, install cable, must be a people person, work freedom, pretty flexible as far as personal time, plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Working in the business department at Comcast brings plenty of information to learn. You will be taught A LOT within the first few months, but the way they teach you works very well with the work that you will be doing. "
good,"I will be very candid during the interenview.  It means little to nothing to do it adhead of that."
good,"Comcast as a company truly cares about its employees.  The company is striving to be the best it can be and is ever changing. Management is strict, their expectations are high, which I believes helps staff perform at a high level."
good,"Comcast used to be a fun place to work and employees were appreciated, the download was the salary.  They pay poorly but benefits were good."
good,The benefits you receive working for the company are great.  But is it really worth it?  I worked in tech support but selling was apart of my performance measurements.  I chose tech support because I do not like selling things.  You are expected to sell when your job description is to fix things.  Then what is the purpose of having a sales department?  Also it is very hard to get promoted or advance to another department.  They are more likely to hire from outside of the company rather than giving the position to someone who has been with the company.
good,"log in to the system and get all your screens up and running"
good,Great foot in the door experience for someone who does not mind learning new things and does not expect rapid career growth.  The diversity within the company is amazing and the benefits outweigh the low salary for my position.
good,"Typical work day for me would start off by reviewing my daily calendar:customer follow ups, networking partners, and installs. Handle any customer issues, running appointments, and working assigned territories. Building rapport with current customers and going above and beyond the requirements set forth by company guidelines.  I create and maintain life long relationships with my customers and because of this I am always the top sales consultant or representative in my area.  I have received numerous awards and recognition for my work ethic.  I love working in outside sales, not only am I fulfilling a customer's need/want, but I am getting paid for what I love to do and in this field you get paid what you are worth."
good,"The benefits are good, but the pressure can get to someone not used to the kind of stress both angry customers and strict goals can create. Its a good job for people that are used to demanding jobs."
good,"management did not communicate very well, and there was very little follow through with commitments. It often felt like our team was given unrealistic deadlines and goals."
good,High paced yet very productive days. Technicians work together as a team to get the job done. Company driven for numbers and customer satisfaction. Cheerful co-workers.   Great company benefits.
good,I liked my supervisor and coworkers and loved the work I did. Its a very fast paced environment with a lot of weekend and holiday work but you are well compensated for said work
good,"it's all about metrics and if you're not meeting them you will be terminated , very stressful and fast paced. Benefits are great but the pay can be a lot better. No time in between calls when busy."
good,I am being forced to write this review. Nothing really to say. I ended up having medical issues come into play and felt it could have been dealt with differently.
good,"The warehouse management team was great but the local support team (tech sups, cable store management) were hostel and rude. Benefits were exceptional"
good,"Need to take own initiatives to get valued at work. management is pretty friendly, only if you get work done and that is everywhere."
good,Incentive games were used to increase moral and sales numbers. Coaching was inconsistent when coaching was needed or required.  Overall not a bad place to work.
good,"Big company you can get lost in it all, but also allows for advancement opportunities as people move and leave. Stressful environment and management creates a lot of that stress, micro managing you to death. Low salary for industry standards but a strong commission structure allowing you to earn uncapped commissions. Great benefits."
good,"The people Around You made it fun. We were a true definition of a team. The retention department was the last department that our customers could talk to.  We took on the most hardest,  irate customers and made them happy and satisfied."
good,"inbound and out bound calls. Retaining customer that wants to disconnect. Explain to customers products,featured benefits and pricing that best fit customers. Learned patients with angry customers and always trained on the best products. Job can be challenging with non stop calls and angry customers. And the end of month when you have reached goals and commission post is the best."
good,"Compensation structure constantly lags approximately 15% - 20% behind the industry average. While there are many reasons why people choose to stay at a company besides the monetary aspect, in the long-run it may lead to a brain drain of their most talented individual who become marketable to a competitor."
good,Good environmwnt to learn cable phone and internet. Must be cut throat at this job and keep your life to a minimum.. Great place to work glzd i got to work there.
good,"The pay and advancement opportunities were the real drawbacks to Comcast. Otherwise, the benefits were not too shabby. I enjoyed most of my coworkers."
good,"pay is not bad, given its well above minimum wage but the monthly quotas and uncertain dialers make it quite a challenge. lose commission and pay more"
good,"Great Benefits, workplace culture great, challenging, demanding, lots of training to begin, but hands on and self -training are essential.  Great Teamwork environment.  Great Supervisors."
good,It is a good company to work at with excellent benefits and pay. You become a part of a family and they are welcoming. You have the option to transfer to better department if you wish to stay with the company.
good,Job is ok.been with Comcast 15 years like my job can be stressful at times. Dealing with customers can be challenging and rewarding at times.benefits are great.also people that work at Comcast are very genuine and are team players
good,"This employee was very team oriented. They often did picnics and raffles for their employees. Unfortunately, I worked for them at a very hard time in the cable business."
good,There were a lot inconsistencies with the workplace culture as far outside sales people schedules.  Each day regardless if the assigned territory was 50 miles from the home office we were still required to show up each morning as well as each afternoon.  This was very counter-productive in my opinion.
good,"Worked here for many years across different departments, there is always chance to grow but it is hard to move since there are so many people going for the same job."
good,I didn't particularly like their business ethics as it pertained to door to door sales in non-solicitation areas without the proper permits.Quite often we were required to knock at least 50 doors a day regardless of the turf we were assigned and the homes could be anywhere from 1/2 a block to a quarter of a mile apart.
good,"Working at Comcast is a very good experience for anyone who starts out their career, because the company gives you a strong motivational impulse & professional background."
good,"Comcast has great benefits and offers many perks including a recently updated maternity/paternity leave policy.  Additionally, there are several positions available in many different facets of the business."
good,"I work 4/10 hour shifts and take calls for all products. Sometimes the customers are not in the right department and I either take care of their concerns or warm transfer them to someone who can help. I speak to a diverse range of clientele and each of them receives professionalism from me. Most times I can handle their issues however if I cannot I reach out to other departments for further assistance. Many times this involves calling customers back or putting them in my calendar. I attend meetings as required. Our management for this department is superb. However at this time the plan is to sent us to different departments and this has created a large amount of concern for our entire team. The most difficult part of my job is when I cannot help someone, especially when they are long-time customers and I cannot get their bill down for example. The most rewarding part of my job is when I can resolve an issue the customer has been dealing with for an extended time."
good,"This organization is grate for anyone who is looking for a direction in life. They will help enhance your current skill and develop new, quality traits. The organization does have a bit of a cult feel due to the culture that is being influenced, however, if you’re willing to work and put in the effort, Comcast can help you get to your next professional milestone. "
good,good place to work 4 days a week 10 hours a day decent pay good benefits on downside is getting raises at time i worked there other then that i would recommend Comcast as a place to work
good,It's a hard job that takes a huge toll on you mentally.  They have great benefits if you live within the footprint and can take advantage of free cable. But if you don't. You really miss out.
good,"A typical day is sitting at my desk taking calls all day."
good,"Over-all I have enjoyed my time at Comcast, however it is a constantly changing company and it can be hard to keep up with policies and procedures from one day to another"
good,"Comcast is leading the efforts to bring entertainment, security and connectivity to its customers regardless of their location. The channels available truly appeal to a varied audience."
good,Looking for something else now. very stressful job. wise it was a 9-5 job. have  to work every weekend. takes a year to be able to get your schedule changed
good,"Great product being offered to the consumer, but very bad history of customer service.  Hard to overcome several objections, while still trying to be successful selling products."
good,Not a bad place to work could use better structure and some better policies. Long work days could start earlier or go to half hour lunches. Unsure of where you stand or what you need to do for advancement unless you hound them.
good,Management and company take great effort to make the day enjoyable with daily games and other team building exercises.  Company values family and the balance of work/life balance and offer great benefits towards the management of life outside of work.
good,"This was generally a great job to go to every day.  My main function was to monitor the system to help prevent any possible outages that might have occurred. The worst part of the job was the fact that there were too many managers and they had no idea what the front lines of the business were like, therefore, we weren't treated with great respect."
good,"Take calls throughout the day, answer any questions customer may have, find customer's needs to offer the right package and upsell an existing customer, solve any issue the customer may have and go above and beyond on every call. Some of the most enjoyable part of the jobs are the benefits, pay, the break rooms that offer entertainment and the free gym for employees."
good,"Pros: Organized company, set schedule, great PTO benefits, overall employees seem to like their jobs. "
good,People and management were very nice and approachable . nice incentives as well and great Christmas parties. A typical day at Comcast was filled with laughter and learning .
good,high demand for perfection. Comcast has very good bonus for working for them but the demand they put on you while your dealing with mostly angry customers can be a bit stressful
good,Good benefits overall. Culture was a little chaotic for the Corp HQ enterprise call center I worked at and would have preferred to work at one of the divisions.
good,Dispatching the technicians was fast paced and a lot of fun. It could be difficult but that was part of the fun. Great people to work with and opportunities with in the Dispatch department. This has since been moved to a dispatching center in Denver.
good,Great place to work if you start early.  In time you will advance if you apply yourself.  I have no complaints.  Very good work life balance.  Benefits are great too.
good,work hours were terrible. everything was about sales. great benefits and job secuirty. good pay good benefits. very diverse and kind people.
good,"I did enjoy working for Comcast, but they shut my department down with very short notice and just let myself and 20 other employees the flap in the wind."
good,"Typical call center environment.  Lots of changes occur fairly often.  Training could be improved to promote consistency throughout the organization.  Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,this is a great company to work for the benefits is a plus there is a very large amount of training due to the upgrades and quality of the company system
good,Originally I worked for time warner cable witch was a great place to work and then I started working for Comcast after company change and they were not very nice to work for. Did not have enough people to do the job right.
good,Stressful enviornment. Management is ok. Hardest part was keeping up with all the promotions and all new work we were required to do without properly being trained on everything.
good,You used to have to fight to get into the Fife Sales Department but now it has become a place that churns through employees due to some upper leadership.
good,Answered calls from highly irritated customers who weren't pleased with the performance of their service(s) or company policies.
good,"Occasional free lunches, very great atmosphere once your acclimated with the culture. Job security is next to none it's either you sell or they find someone who can. I've seen co-workers get dropped like a bad habit on short notices. Managers do what they want when they want, it can be a blessing and a curse. Focus on metrics and building a strong bond with managers and you'll be fine. Commission is uncapped and incentives are very appealing."
good,I loved working at comcast. the people were great fro the most part my super was great. I can not stand cgs the system they use to imput ordes it is horrific and really hard to learn and they are always making changes to it so something that worked five minuets ago may never work again which makes it hard to focus on your costumers. Also i got verry sick i have a recent gluten allergy and i was in the hospital twice because of it one day i came into work swollen like i had been stung all over my face by bees and i could barley talk so thy fired me. i have very conflicted feelings about this workplace.
good,Great company to work for solid benefits the only problem is the bureaucracy. You are always working with tools that are not fit for the job you are trying to do.
good,"Comcast is a company that changes and developed with out looking at the people in front of change. they have a lot of people who are more skilled then the position they are forced into. "
good,"Good job security safe environment, good co-workers. Has high standards on keeping job after probationary period, way to high of expectations for after only training one week,"
good,Working at Comcast is very intense and you have to be a strong individual to take the abuse given by the customer you deal with on a daily.
good,Great place to work. Love my coworkers and team.  Hard work but we come together to get the job done.  We are a family. Great all around benefits.
good,The best part of this job was interacting with customers and saving them money and obtaining faster internet. I sold door to door which was new for me and most challenging.  Immediate management constantly sought ways to improve work environment. It was often frustrating to satisfy customers' needs for timely installation due to poor company customer service policies.
good,A typical day at work starts with me arriving 15 minutes early. I like to arrive early so that I can make my coffee and get my system ready to start my day. What I learned from Comcast is the importance of funnel management when it come to processing order and dealing with contracts. At Comcast we have an open door policy so management is always available. My co-worker are helpful and always available. The hardest part of my job is trying to meet your goal per day even when work is slow. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we have great benefits.
good,we go door to door talking to people about Comcast. we some times work with other sales Associate. Responsible for the sales we make
good,"Part of a high energy professional Payment Services team. Offers large bonuses.  Diverse culture, community oriented and fun place to work."
good,I worked in the Finance Department.  My experience was that this is a hard working company where you are running from the minute you arrive in the morning until you leave at night. Never a minute to get bored which is a good thing.
good,"Multiple location position"
good,"Comcast is not an easy place to work, but have the potential to make good money if you can meet the sales criteria each month."
good,Job not too difficult. Usually took about 20 calls a day.Employees treated well for the most part. Hours were long and some weekend work required.
good,overall not a bad place to work. You must be wiling to sacrifice weekends and holidays to work there. You also get a company cell phone.
good,"Typical workday consist off greeting other employees, logging into phones, dialer systems as well as billing systems. Consistently make out going calls to current Comcast customers, and try to pitch, sale and confirm sales of new and discounted products to those customers. I have to maintain a 90% success rate with my monthly quota of 22 sales. Management is very accessible but not very attentive. The hardest part of the job is maintain success rates with unchanging quotas while sales, products, scripts and promotions are constantly changing. The easiest part of my job is the interaction with different customers"
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. The pay is decent, the commision is attainable, however if you succeed  well you become a target from upper management. If you go on medical you can expect to be terminated once you return."
good,"It was door to door sales. I had a pacific Geographical Territory that i manged to produce TV,Internet ,  and Phones sales from other cable sattelite providers."
good,"Great people, decent office. People looking to set up service call in, and you discuss services and help them make the right choice."
good,Company is good in terms of benefits and okay salary but lacks greatly in customer service with most positions being filled overseas. Problem resolution is severely flawed by inability to track first contact representatives and hold them accountable as they have been known to even hang up on customers seeking credit or other assistance. Technical competency is lacking due to large number of contract workers that aren't held accountable for work done. Great products that provide more interactive service but equipment is unstable and frequently needs to be replaced.
good,"Taking calls and helping customers is the hard part of the job, understanding the job you get paid training for. Great teammates help you out when you need it, and your manager is always there to help. If you don't like call center work then this may not be for you."
good,"Good place to work, if you are looking for a steady job.  As long as you do your job you will be fine.  Communication is lacking between the corporate side and tech support side.  You will get trained just to say your were trained, but you have to learn by doing.  You will be taking calls from mostly upset customers.  Then Benefits are great and once you prove you are self sufficient you can work at home"
good,"Comcast had 1 department doing too much. We not only sold cable tv, but internet, phone, home alarm systems, cell phones, mobile internet, and insurance. "
good,"Fun place to work went there based on pending merger between Comcast and Time warner  but that fell apart as did employ morale ."
good,Management and the work culture is great! Focused on how employees feel about there jobs. Free perks sometimes and lots of incentives.
good,Typical day at work includes outbound calling existing customers and offering them promotional rates on new products or upgrading services.
good,I have tried to advance for 7 years and took the advice given in each interview and ran with it. I finally got my name pushed forward and was told at this point I make to much to advance so basically I was told you will never advance.
good,this is a ok place to work the benefits are great with discounts on cable and internet there's room for advancement if you know how to play their games
good,It's an okay place to work. They make efforts to create a fun environment and offer lots of incentives. They are numbers driven which cause some employees to get clients off the phone as quickly as possible without actually helping them. That made it harder to provide great service. You are reward well for good performance.
good,Contacted customer to resolve issues they had with company representatives or work done.  Enjoyed working with co-workers.
good,"I really appreciated being able to reach out to coworkers for information about company policies, etc"
good,"Open new accounts, sell all products. Answer incoming calls in English and Spanish and try to sell products in every call. Great commission, perks, and benefits. Management are never on the same page."
good,"Was to install video, telephone, internet into homes and commercial buildings. I learned to be patient with customers. I ran into obstacles which made me take a step back and look for other ways to do the job. I was satisfied when the customer was happy."
good,Great pay and benefits but they have lots of turnover good short-term joband it's very hard to get promotedas it's real cliquish
good,"Fast paced, dynamic Human Resources Shared Services environment.  Talented management and HR professionals.  A typical day sees activities ranging from facility moves to merger and acquisition planning to technology upgrades.  "
good,"A typical day at Comcast consists of energy, laughter, and fun. Comcast was a wonderful job. However the way Comcast handled real life situations weren't accurate. They don't believe in non emergencies happening. The attendance is extremely strict. If you have kids, go to school, or have any family illnesses, Comcast is not the job for you."
good,"data entry and technical service for telephone services, great people to work with"
good,"Over all the experiences was great there , the hour was great the benefit was ok."
good,"Leadership was driven by numbers to the extent the job was tough.  There was an enormous amount of turnover in the call center, which, after leaving, was alleviated.  "
good,"good	Responsible for the operational administration of and the review/generation/application of configuration (logical & physical) changes within Comcast CRAN’s (Converged [video, voice & data] Regional Area Networks) and the Comcast Backbone."
good,They don't seem to know there is life after Comcast and management was not fairly selected ........to many favorites was played when it came to days off and off the phone duties.
good,Comcast is a good place to work. The career advancements process is intensive but everyone receives an equal chance to advance. Management could be a whole lot better but the company does like to see its employees excel
good,"Inbound Call Center Representative high stress job, friendly co-workers, must be able to multitask, long hours,"
good,hard to move up in the company in my opinion and you have to expect a lot of change
good,"Duties: Technical Support, Assisted customers on the phone to get their services online and email settings."
good,Great people to work with. Good company. Awesome benefits. meanest customers ever!
good,"We are always building, repairing and maintaining HFC plant to ensure quality service to our customer."
good,"It's an easy job that allows for a good life/work balance.  There are a lot of pay inequities amongst call center supervisors by as much as $10k or more.  That part is not really fair especially if you're doing a better job than someone else.  Other than that, it's a good place to work and great benefits.  Not really any upside in my department though."
good,"Daily routes that might include New Installs or Trouble Call Tickets"
good,"I worked as a Direct Sales Representative.  Going door to door selling and promoting Comcast products like Video High speed Internet and phone services."
good,"It depends on who you have as a manager as to whether the job is enjoyable, I've had both good and bad. The benefits are good, but the work weeks can be long, depending on weather and dispatchers,and company rollouts."
good,"Typical day at work is very busy customers call to cancel service ,to get equipment repaired or replaced, get bill lowered."
good,"Comcast has wonderful benefits, wonderful place to work, great products but the management is terrible."
good,"Take calls from the time to get in till the time you get out. Very little ""off the phone activity""."
good,The hardest part of the job is the customers yelling at you all day. If you can get pass that it is a great place to work. The benefits are awesome.
good,At Comcast the initial and continuous sales training they provide is impeccable and really helps you to succeed.
good,"Tools and goals constantly changing, new products and services and pricing added at random.  Little new product training."
good,"Excellent company to work for, as it is the largest telecommunications company in the United States.  Tremendous growth potential."
good,Enjoyed working with and helping customers and making sure there needs were met.
good,"A typical day at work, spending a lot of time on the phone."
good,I woul d answer the phones and assist customers with their billing issues. I have learned how to read comcast bill. the hardest part of the job would be finding differnet ways of how to explain the bill to a customer. i really enjoed the customers and talking to them on a day to day basis.
good,Clock in start scanning returns about 9 am go to the office stock office. Go back to the warehouse start scanning returns. Build pallet for returns to go to repair.

good,Comcast is a good company to work for however it is a very stressful job. You take anywhere from 35-40 maybe more on a good day and you have a quota to meet. You are under a lot of pressure from your supervisors and they keep pushing and pushing you to the level that you want to just throw your hands up. The turnover rate is very high because of all the stress. I worked with some of the best coworkers there is. Always there to help each other. The management I am sure is just as stressed as we are. The benefits that this company offers is awesome. The pay is very good. The hardest part of this job is the sales. You can't make a person take something they don't want or need.
good,"Great place  to work,supervisors very supportive ,encouraging and uplifting"
good,Comcast a very comfortable workplace. Ive learnned a lot about computers and how to help customers technically. My co-workers are very fun and helpful when needed. The hardest part of my job is the customers being so rude. What I enjoy most about my job i learn so much about technology.
good,"I provided assistance to valued customers, solve issue with billing and provide the best service that fits their needs."
good,I worked with the greatest bunch of guys in the Houston area. We were are former employees of TWC. We all hated that Comcast bought TWC but that's business.
good,"Love the benefits, but unfortunately there is no room for advancement unless you know someone or has been working there 20+ years."
good,"Fast-paced, sales environment with constant change and challenge.  Learned more about flexibility and the skill of adjusting on a daily basis.  I have become more proficient in the area of development and providing feedback."
good,"Each work day is full of challenges from mandatory sales goals, length of time spent on the phone assisting customers in over 8 different states. Co-workers are more likely to assist you with unfamiliar issues than management or supervisors as they are more concerned with numbers rather than quality of service. System issues were not always addressed which effected the individual mandatory goal expectations. Loss of customer care quality replaced by expediently getting customers off the phone and passing issues on in the system to another agent or department to keep your time down per customer. Poor field response to many issues from install time frames to missing or no show technician's. Free cable and internet services. Commission for sales and many promotional events from broadcast providers. Being that I have 6 years of cable TV repair and maintenance it fell beyond me why Comcast would not allow me to even be interviewed as a technician. With extensive knowledge or outage repair and troubleshooting I found that even though the customers were pleased with my knowledge of how to assist them over the phone Comcast would not place me in the field where I would best be utilized. They required me to become a better sales person than on the phone limiting the time that may have been required to assist the customer with their cable TV issues. My what is called first call resolution was always 92% or better meaning regardless of the time it took to help the customer when I was finished their issues had a resolution or a basis for resolution that the customer was pleased with."
good,The job was very goal orientated. Fast paced environment and very competitive within our teams. The most enjoyable part of this job was being a top performer you received great compensation.
good,"Work remedy ticket system to remotely repair and troubleshoot customers issues, call to customers homes to verify issue was resolved and offer future assistance."
good,"installing tv, internet,phone service for customer entertament"
good,"A typical day at work:  helping agents with customers trouble shooting, billing or programming...taking escalations from customer who requested a supervisor...doing reports for supervisors...coaching agents...also training agents...assisting supervisors on interviewing potential agents.  conducting weekly meetings/going over job aids and new items."
good,My typical day at work consisted of logging into cisco phone system and pre calling customers about appointments that had been scheduled. I learned how to become a great leader. Management was ok I had no personal issues at all. My co workers were nice and friendly very helpful. My job wasnt hard I actually moved up to routing techs job for the day. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people in any way possible.
good,"Tested all new systems for management, Customer service calls, trouble shooting, Resolve all issues. Manage accounts and follow through all problems. Sells, Introduce new produces, educate customer and co-workers on system changes. Knowledge of computer systems and all internal comcast internal systems for video, phone, internet, and cell phone. Constant changing work experience with multiple projects introduced by management. Education for new systems with every application introduced for team. Quality control for reports to management"
good,a day at Comcast was always busy and learn something new everyday
good,Comcast was layed back place to work. They offered there employees a lot of benefits with opportunity to grow. I had the opportunity to perform several duties while working there.
good,"very inconsistant across the board"
good,"A typical day in the life of a Residential sales rep was very routine. Had to knock between 30-60 doors to speak to at east 10 a day to acquire 1-2 contracts. After Hurricane Sandy hit NJ, Infrastructure and total losses on residential territories were very difficult to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting out and walking outside and talking to the customers, saving some of them money on their monthly bill, while providing them better services over the competition. I learned to manage my time better, because being a sales rep in the field, our day was blank until you filled it with meetings from customers. Co workers were extremely helpful with one another and we worked as a team and not individuals against each other."
good,"great employees"
good,Great location/ ability to work from home when needed / very friendly and relaxed work environment
good,"good work in general. good training."
good,I enjoy working at Comcast and am thankful for the investment they made in me as a leader through extensive leadership training courses. I enjoy learning from the vast amount of people working in the Houston region as there are so many talented individuals. 
good,there are times whenth right had does not know where the left hands is doing.  there are times of disorganization.  the overall feel of the center is very socialble 
good,"Perform Software testing (Manual and Automation testing )includes Test design,execution,defect logging ."
good,Basically how much money you want to make is how much you make
good,"Great Company To Work For, But Management Needs More Training."
good,Comcast is a great place to work. I had a conflicting work schedule. I really liked the perks and benefits of the company.The pay is also great.
good,A typical work day is to assist customers with account issues. Make sure they have the best customer service experience possible. I take multiply inbound calls. Also make outbound sales calls this is to let customers know of money saving deals that are available.
good,Well trained management and continuing educational staff. Solid benefits package offered. High stress job
good,"Good Products, but systems and structure need some refining"
good,Working at Comcast keeps me on my toes each and every day; I have to be very analytical and detail-oriented. It has an ever-changing work athmosphere and I thrive in this type of environment.
good,With the right team many good things can happen.
good,"Help clients with sale products, inventory for warehouse, off load morning truck"
good,lots of experience working with a team . great benefit package and hourly pay
good,"Answering calls at a high volume rate, while establishing new accounts as well as maintain and upgrading them. I enjoyed that challenge enjoyed setting up phone, cable, and internet services."
good,"Route/map your appointments, check your supplies, gas up if needed and go. Through the management team and co-workers i was able to learn about the flow of signals and the best ways to connect cable service i.e. wrap the house, go through the floor or wall. For the most part you were on your own but if you need help or if you were able to help someone else it was only a radio call away."
good,"I was with the company 13 years, however do to shifts in areas I was downsized 3 times and on the last area I worked in, they changed the job functions all together. With that said, they (the company) took very good care of me, I was offered serverance and help through the transition. I hold no regrets and would recommend them for employment."
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. High volume sales that offers many rewards.
good,"Day at work: Phones, reports, spreadsheets, arrange meetings, arrange luncheons, email, and others too numerous to mention."
good,"My daily activities would include answering the phones for billing, upgrades, downgrades, and technical support. The most challanging part of my job was being able to handle customers screaming at me while I was triing to assist them, and working within company guidelines for things we could and could not do to help customers. I enjoyed talking with co-workers the most."
good,The job itself is ok but they do not accomidate with your schedule.
good,"Comcast has a lot of great benefits and most of the time they will work with you if need be the case regarding any situation. My knowledge with networking and computer troubleshooting has grew since working for Comcast. The management I think need more training when it comes to the job, some agents knowledge are well beyond some of the supervisors and managers. The hardest part of the job is speaking to irate customers and the most enjoyable thing about my job is I have an desk to come to every time I work."
good,A typical day at work is never a typical day. You have to be prepared for anything and the yelling and scream from customers that goes with it.
good,"Fast paced work envirionment, call center, great pay, Typical day consist of back to back calls,"
good,Low paying job but enjoyable staff and comfortable work environment
good,Comcast provides a call center atmosphere that embraces diversity and change in all aspects. This provides opportunity for growth and learning while putting new policies in place.
good,"Through this job I learned how to install and trouble shoot phone, internet, and cable components. Every day I received jobs to install, troubleshoot or disconnet phone, internet, and cable."
good,Great Benefits. Very stressful position. I have learned how to troubleshoot and break down a bill.
good,"The typical day I start off everyday preparing my desk with all of the things in need something to write with,my computer on and ready.checking emails about new and different offers that for customer. Then after preparation, now it's talking to customer over the phone educating them on the great product Comcast provide. Now lastly put in the order that the customer and I went over inform them about installation date. Now continue that until my day is done. I learned that all people are different and you have to handle every experience different. Management and co-workers was great always kept you pushing yourself to be the best out there and be friendly with everyone. The hardest part of the job with keeping up with the goals that was set for employees.Lastly the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and having contests."
good,your seated just about all your shift at work taking inbound calls from customers. high stress but pay even out.
good,Once in a while they feed us a tell us how good we are doing. or making them more money but its all about the numbers and getting the jobs done while it pays the bills we are still very under paid!!!!!!!
good,I start my day checking for new tickets then email once that is completed I move on to projects. Presently one is configuring Bacula for one of two qa labs I am responsible for to include 30% Solaris and 70% Redhat physical servers. I manage one consultant that is on an audit and decommissioning project. I was able to save Comcast 1.5 million dollars in support costs after my first round of decommissions.
good,Comcast is a great company to work for today.
good,"Although my time at Physiotherapy & Associates was breif, I enjoyed the experience. I learned in detail about the billing system and acquired a few new skills, such as being able to process credit card payments via phone, answering incoming calls and things of that nature."
good,Comcast was a definite learning environment. Lots of classes and many new products to use to help our customers. Benefits were excellent and time off not an issue. Paid time off and vacation days were accrued monthly. The only set back was working holidays and night shift at a 24/7 365 call center The most positive part of working there was the commission for each sale.
good,"Working at Comcast with my co workers made it a great working enviroment. We got the task done in a timely matter. We also completed goals that was in short notice, because we work great as a team."
good,"Phone calls back to back are stressful, and you are not provided with all the tools in order to do certain tasks assigned."
good,"Nice company keeps you updated, always have meetings.  keeps you routed 5 minutes apart from each job.  updates you if you are going to be late on a job, or being on a job too long."
good,"The company is a GREAT place to be, especially if you're looking for great benefits and free cable/ internet. The work life balance is not the best, typical retail, where you'll be closing and opening the next day multiple times a week. The worst about this job was the Commission structure, you'd do good one month and the next the goals are higher and the pay structure is lower, basically working twice as hard to get twice as less. If you are a great salesman, this job is perfect for you. If not, then stay away, the micromanaging from the managers will stress you out terribly."
good,"The experience and benefits are second to none. The management seems to be popularity based as opposed to skill based in most locations. Advancement opportunities come to the most popular, not the most qualified otherwise it's a good place for people not looking to advance far but still make decent money in a day to day setting."
good,"It is a good job for a call center, but benefits and pay could be better.   The training and supervisors could be better.  There are a lot of good people there."
good,"The benefits package was great and I had an amazing supervisor but, future growth and advancement is dependent on when someone leaves or retires and there are many techs vying for the same position. Seniority plays a major part in the selection process."
good,"Comcast was the first position I ever had in a call center, so I never had much to go on as far as job comparison."
good,Handled all workers sheets.  Got to know people and customers on a daily basis.  Expected to be at work exactly on time.  If you were late or called in sick you were docked that time and given a warning.
good,"This place have great benefits and pay. Just needs to offer better scheduling for new employees, let them have a pick on a shift that is suitable for their work life balance."
good,"Comcast looks out for its employees. Allows the flexibility to do what you think is best for the customer and company. Can be hard to be in cable industry in this day and age, but I think Comcast is on the right track."
good,"only full time shifts"
good,"Overall, good company.   Job was transferred to another state.  But that is Comcast—looking for ways to lose good people ,   Stressful environment.  Each month there was a flavor of the month to enhance performance. Should not have out sourced.    There is no loyalty to Comcast and they do not care about the customers"
good,"When I first started it was a fun place to be, now its very stressful. Its a paycheck with good benefits. They play favorites within this company. They expect miracles when miracles can't happen."
good,"It just became stressful for me to work there. I wanted to advance more , but you know how some people pic and choose who they want to advance. The work environment was cool, but it became to much"
good,"They were a cool"
good,"Unfortunately the store that I worked at was managed very poorly. Poor communication on what was expected of me. My management team was not good at explaining exactly how they wanted things done. The management team gave no positive reinforcement when they corrected me; it felt as if they were trying to tear me down instead of building me up. When procedures in the store changed, there was not enough notification to me to change how I ran the floor. They were also not flexible. They were not approachable if I needed they help or understanding. The managers at my particular store were too hands off, not enough direction. If anything went wrong, I was pretty much blamed for it. I could not give any sort of reasoning for something not going right without them saying I blaming them. Even when i acknowledged that i had areas to improve in, I  had little to no help in reaching my goals."
good,"At Comcast, it is a relaxed atmosphere which helps with communication. Great environment to work and connecting with others, in and outside of the company."
good,"I like the flexible hours and the fact that overtime hours were offered.  I also liked that the pay was hourly but you were also able to make commission on top of that as well.  I liked that team meetings were held every day but were brief enough so that we could get back to work.  I also liked the open door policy that we had with our managers,  We could talk with them onw on one.  I liked that.  I liked the team environment."
good,I absolutely hated the phones and the micro management. If you took to long typing notes in on an account they would announce it on the radio and someone would be over to harass you. Went a minute over your bathroom break? You’ll be spoke to.
good,"Good company to work for with great bennies, good management. Stress was always high to make sure goals were met on a monthly basis just like any other sales position."
good,Supervisors are not understanding and if  they don’t like you they will seek out anything to get rid of you. Work is very stressful and there is no understanding of cable even after training
good,"Compensation is to low for all the work is done . Comcast need raise the compensation starting off BAE 1 45,000 to 50,000 salary then commission need stay no cap. It will be a great company to work for financial wise I hear a lot of employees complain about that ."
good,"Comcast Spotlight is a decent place to work for but they do not let you advance and move up. The benefits are great, as well as time paid off and lots of discounts on different things as well as cable and internet discount. However, we are also underpaid and they find ways to do things the cheap way. They do not care about the employees that have been here long and instead always try to get the cheaper less experienced new people. Management is not good also, they will ask you if you are interested in advancing but ultimately it will never happen. Been with the company for 4 years now and still in an entry level position despite me applying to multiple jobs within."
good,Comcast has a good work home balance. You have plenty of time off and the supervisor was good to me as well. There are room for advancement if you have the experience.
good,"If base salary is not your primary concern, I would highly consider comcast for employment. They are inclusive, open and promote from within. The benefits offered; such as health care, stock options and 401k matching are all above industry standard and available to baseline employees."
good,"Great job, requires time and attention. You get what you put into company. They offer good benefits that include paid time off. They have a nice civil professional environment where the job comes first. Which is refreshing in a customer service setting with respectable management."
good,Great job but management tends to be a bit difficult to deal with. The work was very enjoyable and for the most part as long as you performed within expectations your days were very smooth
good,I enjoyed my job I was employee of the month. I worked well with others and got along good with costumers. I worked for comcast for almost 19 years and probable still be there if I did not move to Colorado.
good,Comcast is a pretty ok place to work. They have amazing benefits. The only issue is listening to their employees needs. It took almost two years for them to review pay and in the end told us Comcast doesn't increase pay due to cost of living.
good,"Great Job with ability to promote, Management does not appreciate staff. Fun job. Very bad management. Be prepared to travel daily. You need to be tech savvy."
good,"Comcast is a really great place to work. People are passionate and really like working there. It doesn't match their reputation. It is a good place to work, but only if you like Philly."
good,Comcast is great company to work for  out of high school fast laced always busy customer facing team oriented goal driven great company and perks good
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for that provides fair pay and great benefits.  I enjoyed my time working there, and only left due to a better opportunity.  I would recommend the company to anyone looking for employment.  Hiring process can be lengthy.                                  .                                                      ."
good,"I typical day consisted of setting up the day for others. My team was the front end of dispatching for the day. Starting the flow over 50-60 technicians. "
good,I liked working there and helping customers... HOWEVER... I am not a big advocate to feeling like if I don't make a certain amount of sales then I lose my job.
good,"Hours and days at comcast change every couple if months. You have to pick from hours offered and hope to get your first 3 picks out of many that you choose in order of a numbering system. This happens every couple of months a year. It is bad for people who have kids in school, daycare, or shared responsibility at home."
good,"Very fast paced, metrics galore. Every minute accounted for, if your not used to having someone overlook your performance this is not the place to work."
good,"Comcast has wonderful benefits and they hire from within most of the time, changes are done all often. The environment is casual but the work is constant and fast paced."
good,This was a call center environment.  The hours were not on a set schedule but once you were hired on they had great benefits for all employees.  They were understanding bout scheduling.
good,"If you don't mind working nights, weekends, and all holidays except for Christmas, and not knowing what your paycheck will look like on payday, then this is the place for you. I am very disappointed with Comcast's continual stringent sales requirements as they continue to lower the commission sales payouts. I will NEVER work in sales again. Way to risky and unstable as far as pay."
good,"I always collaborating and suggested good enhancements to processes and/or systems and volunteered to pilot projects but whenever it came time to be put up to move to another position or advance where I was I was never considered, the only individuals that were considered were the ones that just hung out with the management. They didn't have any work-related merit other than being close friends and that shouldn't be a factor, one's work should shine."
good,Large company with an ambitious drive to continue to grow. Great place to learn procedures and processes. Peers you work with are great. Great benefits as well.
good,first tech support/sales account that i had handled and the experience was great. I had to resign because my family is getting bigger and i need a higher pay.
good,"A typical day requires you to travel from job to job within a short time frame. You may be scheduled 3 jobs in the same time frame that you are required to complete on-time. Then you may be called to do another job with one minute left in your work day and cant leave until that job is complete. So if you like overtime then this will work for you.  The best part of the job is the quiet time you get driving from job to job, and on occasion the people you interact with during the installation"
good,"Really good benefits ranging from free internet, and cable to great medical, and dental benefits however I do not feel the pay matches what the job requires."
good,"Although the benefits and compensation in general were okay, rules commission goals and expectation continually changed so it was difficult to master job and increase salary from year to year."
good,Comcast has amazing benefits. Management is  for the most part fair and honest until work performance is affected. Tech job almost makes it impossible to have a family life and the pay is not that great and advancement is almost impossible.
good,Comcast employees are amazing but the higher ups dont care about them and also dont give you enough resoarces. Other then that the job was pretty cool
good,"They are always innovating to make themselves the best out there.  That was a great boost in job security.  Additionally, they invest in you as an employee.  It is a great company to work for."
good,"Enjoyed the ability to work independently, without very much supervision. Was given the independence to resolve issues whenever possible without extended delay for the customer."
good,Fast paced work environment that focuses on numbers and stats. Real by the book but fair company. Work environment is friendly at the same time serious
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. If you intend on applying, consider what I'd be like working in a call center. It's a good opportunity but it also can be extremely draining."
good,"Long work days, disrespectful customers, irrate customers, slow supervisor responses, great commission pay, stressful and no room for schedule changes to accomodate higher education."
good,A very Stressful company to work for. Though you are paid very well and Comcast had the best benefits out of any company I have ever worked for in the past.
good,"I left Comcast over 10 years ago. So I don't know the culture now. But while I was there, I loved it for the first couple of years and then hated it for the last 2 years I was there."
good,Comcast is fast-paced but it can be very stressful not only with customers but also with the companies lack of communication with front line agents. The company is ver innovative but they tend to forget to let their agents and customers know when they are making changes or doing something new. Change is hard for a lot of people and comcast is not prided on making it easy.
good,"As a dispatcher, route the repair technicians and installers to scheduled jobs, that are set up in overlapping time frames. Assure all make it to jobs in scheduled time frame. "
good,Good or bad
good,"Stressful work environment, great benefits.  The company does commit to your development if you work hard.  They want to see you be successful.  It is hard work."
good,"The benefits are amazing but when it comes to moving forward and growing within, it definitely seems that it's more who you know and not what you know"
good,it was a lovely place to work....sometimes dealing with customers was a little bit stressful but it was a nice experience ...i learnt alot of customer service ..how to relate to people as well
good,it was hard work and you hade to be self motivated because you had your own routes and you had no boss on your back to tell you to get back to work but that dose not mean you do what ever you want.
good,High sales volumes. Door to door knocking. You need to be able to walk a few miles a day. Cannot be shy as you are prospecting into new businesses. Be ready for every yes and no.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at comcast. There were a few reasons why I left: management had preferences, worked overnight, was not paid sales as promised, and customers can be irrational but I guess that's in every call center."
good,"The job has its ups and downs. Beginning salary is low compared to competitors though they offer other incentives like home garage, etc. To ""balance"" the low pay. Old vehicles. Slow administration."
good,This Job was actually a lot of fun. There were contests on a regular basis and the compensation was really good. The only downside was the nature of the job. After a while the headset felt like an electronic leash.
good,"Comcast is a decent company to work for, but the stress levels are very high because of quota levels are very high.  You will find yourself working around the clock to hit them.  The benifits are excellent."
good,Day to day is explained and expectations are clear. It's kind of hard to move up within the company because the employees do get comfortable in their positions.
good,Comcast had a lot of great programs for employees however they did  not follow through with a lot the programs. Career advancement was not what they said it was and I applied for several positions and never got feedback or an interview.
good,"Sit at your desk and answer calls depending on your queue and the day you can have between 0 to 10+ minutes. between calls. There are things to do during your breaks including a pool table, PS4, basketball court outside, gym, and a picnic area."
good,"Inconsistent Training caused for unreliable coworkers. Way too compartmentalized and a lot of ""it's not my job"" attitudes made team work extremely difficult. Communication across different departments could prove to be difficult at times causing a lot of misunderstanding and set backs which in turn caused a lot of unnecessary customer down time."
good,"Comcast is a great company for consistency and room to grow as a whole. If your role isn't revenue generating (sales), then the income disparity is vast if you aren't a member of management. Sales will bring you in some good income based on your market and your immediate team you are working with. Work hard and you should find a lot of success with Comcast. Sales can seriously get you burnt out though with the roles. Whether selling business or resi services for a few years."
good,"A lot of work back to back with little breathing room, but if you do well and show dedication you can advance fairly quickly with pay raises. Must be willing to accept that you will work un-volunteered overtime."
good,"As a sales rep I received calls from either current comcast customers that were wanting to upgrade/add services, or from those that were wanting to become a brand new customer. Being able to accept changes on a regular bases, and process work orders was a must. Everyone was grouped into teams, we always competed to see who could sell the most product. We became like a family."
good,"Comcast was an amazing opportunity for me. I learned a lot from computers, to people, to products, to friendships. I loved my time at Comcast. Yes, the hours were long sometimes. The customers were unbareable. The job seemed like it only got harder as you went. But this job was incredibly rewarding. If you can put up with humanity, bosses who are too busy with other things, and a distracting work environment, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this company. Free cable, free internet, the buy lunch all the time, free coffee - the best, benefit wise. "
good,"I originally started there because they were willing to pay more than my current job at the time, but grew to enjoy the atmosphere. Enjoyed the coworkers and learned a lot about interpersonal communications and techniques."
good,Collections is a very hard job. It is almost like you can have no empathy for those who owe on a bill. They only care if you collect a certain amount of money and leave out the compassion and human element of it.
good,"A typical day at work includes handling anywhere between 40-90 customer calls."
good,"Right out of high school i held different job, but Comcast was one that i stand the longest at. They have good benefits and overtime. If you are willing to work hard you can move through the company to get any position."
good,"Recognizes, conveys, promotes and sales products and service values. Maintained excellent oral and written communication skills, with demonstrated ability to articulate relevant information and direction in an organized and concise manner."
good,"Helping customers with troubleshooting problems on their equipment, upgrading services, educating the customer, going over billing related questions, deescalating irate customers"
good,"I would start the day giving my sales reps area and spend my day doing payroll, sales reports and problem solving. the hardest part of my job was keeping my reps happy with their areas."
good,Good to place to work. The benefits are good but pay could be better. The people are pleasant to work with and the managers are good to work for.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the dispatchers and the placement of work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,"After 1.5 years of working for Comcast Xfinity, I can honestly say that I learned a lot about problem solving, great customer service delivery, and enhanced my computer skills. I have learned to address technical equipment issues as well as interpreting complex code errors from customers' accounts, turning them into basic explanation. Management hasn't been always on top of their game, this year due to short-staffing, employees quitting, but at the end of the day management still pulls through. Overall, Comcast has a lot of opportunity for different positions to apply for and also brings out the best in you. The sales environment can be quite stressful with customer complaints and coworker/new hire ambitions. However, adapting to that kind of environment will only make you stronger."
good,"It's a good place to work because you have good benefits and a nice deposit in your bank account every two weeks. They don't cap commissions as some other companies do. You get your commission for whatever xfinity product you sell over the phone. There's paid time off as well as holidays, and if you're lucky you could get a good shift. Made some good friends there and I'd work there again"
good,"I worked at Comcast for many years. Moved up through several positions and enjoyed each position that I took on. It is more difficult to maintain a position in the customer service and sales departments due to the ever changing stats that must be adhered to but it is possible to get the job done. Management, for the most part, was always helpful and friendly. Once I moved into a less customer facing position and worked from the back office, I started to really enjoy my Comcast life. Office team was much smaller than the call center teams and the full team including management were able to actually get to know one another. I definitely wouldn't mind going back. I would like more money, though."
good,I've been with the company for 15 years. Great place to try many different jobs and a lot of opportunities for advancement. I've encountered poor leadership in some positions that have caused massive burn out of employees.
good,"no day is ever the same "
good,"A typical day at work will consist of calls from customers wishing to cancel or downgrade services. You are ""The Solver"". The hardest part of the job is knowing that you won't be able to offer a solution that fits everyone."
good,Spent 4 years at NBC and meet some awesome people. Life long friends now but the trying to move up the corp ladder is harder than it should. It not what you know but who and if you are incompetent in your ability to do your job you should not have the job. Overall they have made IT support all about the number of tickets you have and not about the relationship and customer service you create.
good,"Comcast was a fun environment to work in! Always sales contests and perks. They provided catered lunches several times per week. The call flow and sales metrics were changed on a monthly basis, which made it difficult sometimes to make sure you were always meeting metrics. I met several amazing people working there. Plus, how can you go wrong with free/discounted Comcast services?"
good,You are told that you can make up to $1200 in commission by just showing up for you shift.  Not true.  I know people who haven't made a commission since they starting working at Comcast.
good,The commission structure makes for unethical activities. If the base pay was higher and the commission was removed the customer experience would be MUCH better.
good,Relentless call metrics. Company in transition to improve customer experience creating a bundles of condridictions
good,"Most employees make the best of good times and bad, so the atmosphere keeps up. The customer base can be irritating at times, but relatively easy to deal with. Management is understanding and its typically a promote from within, so advancements happen frequently."
good,"Comcast is a great environment to work in. The associates, supervisors and managers are all welcoming. "
good,"Must be ready to change/adapt/adjust daily"
good,"A very challenging workplace. Benefits are above average. Management is excellent, always willing to allow technicians the chance for advancement. Peers are equally motivated. A fast paced environment."
good,"Never a dull moment because it changed every day as is the world of media.  "
good,Working for Comcast was great management was wonderful I felt like they really did care about there employes. The work hour wasn't go great not well to help if you need a earlier time.
good,Worked closely with customers. Had a set amount of hours but depending on your work load you either finished on time or came home late. The job had it's perks though. You worked by yourself most of the time and customers generally seemed in a good mood when dealing with the techs. The hardest part of this job was always appeasing the customers. The easiest part of this job was being able to work on things by yourself.
good,"Pros: Benefits, Pay, Incentives, Employee Outings/Fun"
good,Great Team. Great place to work. Plenty of room for advancement. The team members were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Very hard working group of people. Always an ever changing place to work. Opportunities are plenty. Expectations are high, and work comes in waves, at times you will put in many extra hours."
good,"Safety here as a tech was not a priority, therefore poutting partnes at risk to be seriously hurt. Other than that the job was great, and the people I worked along with per great people that enjoyed the work they do."
good,Comcast was a great place to work.  I learned so much.  I gained a lot of technical experience as well as customer service knowledge.
good,Managed teams in multiple states with each group having different responsibilities. Met with managers via phone during the day to get status updates on what they were working on.
good,"Everyday was planned perfectly. I leaned great customer service skills, quality practices, and telecommunication skills. My management team was very well versed in my field. We worked as a team to complete all assigned tasks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with dissatisfied customers but the best part was being able to use my acquired skills to complete jobs and ultimately satisfy almost all customers."
good,"most customers  that call in are rude and disrespectful"
good,"My daily duties were to manage executive's calendars, set up meetings, handled their travel and did their expense reports, along with other admin duties. I worked around a group of great co-workers who supported one another.  The hardest part of the job was having to read the minds of my bosses.  Also, there were communication issues with one of my bosses and there were no support.  The most enjoyable part of my job was how flexible my position was and how my job would have activities for the employees to participate in."
good,"comcast  was good for the money but it so ghetto, the managers are very rude at times, and everybody has attitudes in that place"
good,Big company with good benefits.  If you want to advance the opportunity for growth is there.  The constant changes in strategies makes it hard to retain customers.
good,"i Learned alot working at comcast i learned great customer service skills, i worked with alot of people on a daily basis. liked managment, they were very nice people. great hours, and great tv company."
good,This is a great job but the management still needs some training on leading efficiently and making sure they have the correct information.
good,I actually am a consultant for Robert Half so I am unable to speak on benefits/compensation and advancement. The groups I have been in treated me like a full time employee. The culture is great and the management was great.
good,"taking calls regarding billing concerns etc, handling escalations and inquiries, processing upgrades and disconnects. great evironment with coworkers, benefits are ok"
good,"Comcast is a company that is growing very quickly with multiple acquisitions and the pending Time Warner acquisition that will greatly increase their nationwide footprint."
good,I answered incoming phone calls from prospective clients. Sold and reviewed new applications. I also assisted in helping the customer understanding their bills and benefits.
good,"Comcast is a very good employer. There are great benefits like  401K, healthcare, free cable and employees are rewarded for achieving goals."
good,"My days went by smooth, fast, and great. I learned to have patients, help customer with technical issue and different sorts. My co-workers where very friendly and helpful when needed."
good,Non-stop fast paced place to work. I learned a lot working with customers over phones and how to talk through many issues. I also learned the importance of a sales pitch in the workplace such as this. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The best part of the job was working with computers
good,only part time and no enough pay. need to increase pay and commission
good,"Comcast is a great place for an entry level position,   I enjoy my co-workers they make the place come alive. The hardest part of the job is knowing that there’s not really much space for advancement, the most enjoyable part would be the satisfaction I get from helping others."
good,Log onto the phones. Take numerous outbound calls daily. You got paid on commission based upon the sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the new people I got to interact with.
good,"Days are full of meeting new people"
good,okay good benefits horrible hours. good people opportunities for advancement are okay.
good,"The job was very stressful because of the customers, but the company knew how to compensate its employees.  We got quarterly bonuses and many raises."
good,"installing cable, how to manage time ,management is very inconsiderate, very easy to work with, nothing is hard about installing cable,helping people"
good,I was a MCC traffic opp. and was in charge of working on clients products as well as over seeing very complex opp. systems on a daily basis. It all became challenging from time to time in this deadline orientated business. The challenge was also the joy.
good,"Customer Service oriented business that is fast paced and requires team work. My position requires patience, understanding the products and services, and being consumer friendly."
good,Call center that keeps me employed. I have no more comments.
good,A typical day at work is troubleshooting customers cable issues.
good,Hard work that is underpaid but job security and benefits were great.
good,In and employment opportunity i go in with a positive go getter attitude willing to work hard and learn along the way.
good,assisting tech in the field while working assigning open work to available techs
good,"Each day i would receive hourly jobs of houses I have to visit to install or troubleshoot the tv, phone or internet.  I receive the job on my work phone i call the house first to make sure they know I'm on my way.  Through out the day i get jobs and i complete them as they are given to me.  In this job sometimes you have to be creative to get the job done and our supervisors were just a phone call away to help in any problems.  The co workers were there for you when you needed them.  You help them and in return they will help you.  The hardest part of the job was working in the ran.  You had a schedule to keep so you did what you could in the ran and waited out when it really got rough.  The best times on the job were the smiles on the customers faces when i was done fixing their problems or just installing."
good,"Everyday was different due to the location of where my technicians would be assigned. I've been cussed out in Spanish, English, Creole, Chinese, you name it, but I've also spoken to the sweetest customers in the world. Comcast definitely was family oriented as they put on family events during the summer and hosted Holiday gathering for the entire district."
good,Learned new and future technologies. friendly co-workers. Respect & value to people.
good,"I learned how to improve my communication skills, overcoming objections, and dealing with irrate customers. "
good,"Great benefits but unfortunately advancement is mostly based on who likes you and very little to do with your work, skills, and potential."
good,"Comcast is a very large company, and offers great benefits. Comcast was a very comfortable place to work, management and supervisors were very helpful. The hardest thing about this job was having to go through shift bids. But I enjoyed being around my Comcast friends."
good,"Sales "
good,COMCAST is a huge successful company who offers great pay and great benefits to their employees but it comes with a price you our property of comcast which means nothing else matters anymore not your family your education deaths in your family you are a number a slave they say you can advance buts its not true the only way you can advance if you know someone in a higher positiorn who will pull some strings you mean nothing to the company even after being there 15 years. the job is a headache its a very stressfull eviroment and it will kill you. you never know what to expect with comcast you can come to work and they will tell you that your schedule has changed and you are now doing this with out any training and that you will be scheduled for training next week but the pay and benifits are good just not that good to go thru hell everyday the customers are upset and upper management is too oh and they will rob you of your raises since they start you off at 14hr i guess they dont wanna pay u anymore
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for. Their benefits are great, and there is a lot of training. "
good,"come in check my emails, pull up all sites that I would you throughout the work day. login and take calls"
good,"I loved working for comcast. It is very fast paced, ever changing, and organized chaos. But that is a great enviornment for me. If you want a quiet, same thing everyday kkind of job, this is NOT the place for you."
good,The benefits and the people are great. Sometimes the work is a little daunting
good,It is a good job that has a lot of perks. However the customers are extremely rude and we are not allowed to say anything back. It is a fun environment from free ice cream to pie the supervisor. Management some are unfair and show alot of favoritism however if you mind your business you'll be great.
good,We took inbound and made some outbound calls. Customers who was experiencing trouble with their Comcast services we would try to troubleshoot.
good,"Hard work and lots of drive is what you need to make it here, taking time off is difficult because it puts you behind on quota attainment. However they do have plans in place for quota relief if you are taking enough time off. Co-workers are great and so is management."
good,Extrememly busy environment. Pay not all that good. Staff and coworkers were pretty cool
good,"This is a great company to work for, however, it's not what I'm used to doing. I've never had to work on commission and make quotas like this before. It wouldn't be bad except a lot of the customers we call are either extremely upset with Comcast of they've signed up for the services the week before we called. It would be easier to make sales if we offered the customers something they wanted. My co workers and my managers are wonderful to work with. I enjoy laughing and sharing with them. I've learned how to overcome the different excuses a customer will give as to why they don't want the product you are selling. i have also learned how to turn an unhappy customer into a happy customer. The thing I enjoy the most about this job is talking to the pleasant customer that I get from time to time and also, the free cable isn't so bad."
good,"Friendly and clean environment, training available for those looking to improve and move around. Great benefits package that includes free services and health benefits."
good,Fun monday team meetings! Especially the apre meeting venues in Somerset.
good,Very innovative technologically. I learned to not get too comfortable with success if you had been then for a long period of time in upper management. My team was tremendous to work with; we won many awards for superior customer service metrics vs other districts in region. The job didnt seem hard at all because I enjoyed what I was doing so much. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pride we had in delivering a superior product to our customers.
good,"a typical day is processing over 100 inbound calls from customers who has concerns with their billing, or having a problem with a product or services"
good, Recovered equipment from residential and commercial homes and businesses.
good,"A typical day at the office involves me to provide technical support for Comcast customers and co-workers. I've learned a tremendous amount of information about internet and computer functions. The hardest part of this job is to retain the loyalty of the customer after they've had numerous service issues. The most rewarding part of this job is being able to help others, and feeling like you've made a difference."
good,"very flexible schedules,bonus and incentive programs,very helpful if you are a working student,daycare services available,free cable,internet, and telephone service."
good,it all right but dispatch doesn't care if you get a lunch or get off on time but i promise you they always get off on time and always get a lunch. It just gets old quick. Last thing with this new advancement system no one is advancing.
good,its a good work place. I just think you're under paid compared to the amount of work you do. I don't like the fact that there is no human aspect to the job. everything is based off numbers including your raise.
good,"The work is challengeing everyday. Learning new technology daily and meeting differnt culture of people and solveing problems others missed. Teamwork was at a high most of the time. Very dangerous ladder climbing, crawl spaces, actics and, driveing. Meetings every week to come up with new ideas to make job easier."
good,"Comcast is a very fast paced and stat and goal driven company.  You must meet metrics for productivity, quality, sales, first call resolution, and retention in order to get annual pay raises.  They do company shift bids annually and it is performance based.  The company is very strict on attendance.  This is a downside for people who have family responsibilities, health concerns, or a disabled child, spouse, or parent.  The benefits begin day one, which is wonderful.  This includes flex days, vacation days, and floating holidays.  They are moving more towards a virtual or work from home environment, which makes is hard to advance into higher positions, unless you relocate, out-of-pocket, to another area, which does not participate in this program. Overall, if you are not working in a front line customer service position, the company is excellent to work for and they do support their employees during times of disasters and believe in corporate responsibility and their carbon footprint."
good,Pretty much your basic call center ... wages and benefits are very good the longer you have been with the company the more paid time off you get ... they offer benefits with 401k as well
good,Its a good job to use as a stepping stone to advance to another position. The benefits are great and my peers are awesome. Commission fluctates drastically more than it use to.
good,"Comcast people to work with are great, the customer calls aren't so great. They're never satisfied. Comcast management are very polite and help you when needed."
good,"Everyone would have to see for themselves to see if it's a right fit for your life. Wonderful products and benefits. Culture, family oriented,  opportunity for uncapped commission."
good,The onboarding was very thorough and they made sure we were prepared to do our jobs before we had to actually do them so to speak. I had a good experience working there. People are people of course. If you just stay in your own lane and do a bit of networking you can do very well there if you'd like to. Really up to you.
good,This job offers reasonable benefits. The job is stressful. The tools given to combat with customers is limited. While working in the Comcast call centers customers are you main focus and your worst enemy.
good,As a customer account executive you are responsible for a variety of sale and technical tasks. This position can be very stressful. Commissions are always changing to benefit the company. Standards are very high yet the rewards are not.
good,"The culture was family like, but the amount of work was pretty heavy. Some of the practices didnt make much sense. The Supervisors micro-managed you, which is pretty stressful in itself."
good,"No comment here other than comcast needs to pay their employees more than what they currently are paid. Inbound sales reps get paid 18.65 during training, and after training receive 10.00 per hour plus a ton of commission equalling 18.00-22.00 per hour, where as bulk employees makes 13.00 per hour, and make a fraction of the commission that inbound sales reps make, plus do about 40% more work. Big difference in pay, and work load."
good,I must admit that i wouldn't be the person i am today with out being a member of the comcast direct sales team. At first i was kinda thrown out on my own but that actually helped me exceed in the sales world
good,I did enjoy working for this company because of the following I was constantly moving problems solving and I enjoy using my brain to fix complex problems on my own the feeling to me is priceless
good,Comcast is a good job if u can handle the day to cursing out from customers. I enjoyed the money and the fun at Comcast. The saleing part was a no go for me
good,"I’ve only had the opportunity to work in the Nashville area for Comcast. I’ve been there for 5 years, and when I say the Nashville sector is unorganized and gives you the run around;I say it whoheartedly. Certain managers and superiors are confused on what exactly needs to be done and others and are blowing in the wind. Comcast as company is great to work for but not the Nashville region, stay clear. I’m leaving after all these years because of the unorganization and new management has not set advancement goals after a year of being open."
good,"Working for Comcast was an amazing experience.  However, the competitive market in advertising created a lot of layoffs.  Comcast is known to lay off people, change their current title, reduce the wage of the position and then try to hire back the same people to do the same job with a few minor changes.  One department was layed off twice in 7 years, only to be hired back at a lower wages/new title."
good,"comcast t1 tech support is good for newbie IT careers, the pay was minimum at 15 an hour. To move up takes too long and it's a call center environment so expect just that."
good,"Great culture low pay.Job security is good. I worked in the Sf bay area and they do not pay v you enough to live on your own plain and simple. If you are 18 fresh out of high school then it is a great job, if you live at home and don't pay rent. Benifits are great though. No complains at at about the health care. The Kaiser coverage Comcast gets its the good. I had surgery on my shoulder for $100."
good,This job was nice but very stressful. Management could have been more supportive. This job gave you the opportunity to make overtime. There was not being laxed.
good,Being required to offer every product on every call no matter how inappropriate for the circumstances made this a stressful place to work. Management was great.
good,"Very Busy/sales Oriented Work Environment. "
good,"Typically I work 9.5 hrs a day I travel 45 min each way, I have been with Comcast for 18 years.  I have learned so much about the Communications industry, Management, workplace involvement and much more about myself"
good,"during my employment of only 4 years, we made 5 company-wide changes in order to keep our product relevant  It was a privilege to work under the leadership that I did, and miss the atmosphere. Had I not been laid off due to outsourcing, I would still be there."
good,The company pays really well and you get a great discount on their products ans services. The cons is that a lot of people don't work together. So you spend a lot of time with angry customers that were told one thing but received a different thing from fellow employees. this may because your commission s based off your performance. So alot of other employees may lie to customers and you may left cleaning the mess. now this isnt all comcasts fault they try to get rid of employees and weave out the ones that do this. however. you;r always going to have this issue with commission and stats the way the company runs.
good,"I actually loved working for Xfinity! However, as big as the company is I feel like they should have better job security when closing a department down. The benefits are excellent and I have no complaints in that area. It's very difficult to move up in the company or even get another position internally and that shouldn't be the case."
good,"great company to work for. advancement could be better. benefits were great, however the company as a whole could have a better atmosphere. management could work on inclusion of all employees."
good,"Great place to work.  "
good,"The Results Company has competitive pay, flexable hours, and a good back office. My supervisor was awesome and the work itself was not hard. It seemed they had difficulty keeping agents satisfied because billing took on the work from other departments creating a sometimes hectic environment throw on the never ending stream of new hires and it starts to become stressful. The job site was ran fine but the expectation of the client was higher then what could be fulfilled. They offered insurance benefits but good luck trying to process a claim with said health benifits."
good,Overall good environment working among different cultures...numerous reps with different skill sets.opportunity for growth in different positions within the company.
good,the job is sometimes stressful and the pay is not where it needs to be. the manager wants you to work xtra hard for low pay. room for advancement is low
good,"A typical work days involves a lot of calls, a lot of disconnects, and driven to make you better I would say. You have to be thick skinned and really good at selling I would say.I work in Retention so its definetily hard but its worth every sec. It helps you grow if you perceive it that way. You have to deal with a bunch of changes and people (customers) who think they know better than you but just stay focused. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep up and meet all your metrics and having customers transferred to you because the last person didn't do their job right. The most enjoyable part is having a customer who understands."
good,If you can handle the rejection and miles of walking it is a good job. The benefits are awesome!. The only part I really don't like is that it seems you are constantly have to fight to get paid for what you already sold.
good,Great company to work for minus the rating system. Very poor grading system in which hits your when its all the customers fault. Also way overbooked. Very fast paced which isnt and issue for me just the life balance and grading system is my gribe when trying to meet metrics.
good,"Overall this was my favorite position I've ever held other than the extreme stress from the requirements. I was not enthused about having to sell products and services, however a career advancing trajectory was clear and attainable."
good,"Typical day consist of  working with customers resolving issues and install customers cabel. It is a very interesting job with each day offering something new each day. Overall it is a good job, but not a career."
good,The benefits are great. The company is so driven by numbers that I feel like I'm only a number to them. Love my coworkers but management and the supervisors make the job very stressful.
good,"working at comcast was rougly rough we were underpaid for the amount of work, management was great but we did not recieve enough training and the tools did not work as they were supposed to."
good,good company for start you career but not good enough when it goes to higher levels of Network expertise. and management can be better a lot for this huge company.
good,"I had much success at Comcast with great pay and many highly recognized awards for being an over achiever. Management made a decision to change my help with customers to Customer service only help with my vendors and relationships I built over ten years, causing friction to all my customer and clients."
good,"log on technet (daily routes posted) "
good,"Great Place so work for, awesome management,caring environment, continuous training, good pay and benefits. Love the atmosphere and great location. Growing company"
good,"Comcast Xfinity definitely taught me many sales strategies and ethics. Also taught me about account managing and following up with leads. The best thing about the job is the culture, eveyone is so friendly and they're all great to work with."
good,"Good company, great benefits. Learned a great deal form the company from troubleshooting to why billing are the way they are."
good,I have had a good experience with working at this job being around people who cares about their clients and working together to make the clients feel safe and taking care of.
good,Great environment. HR needs new people who actually likes their job. Learned that every actions doesn't deserve a reaction. People just want help with things they do not understand.
good,Decent place to work. Perks are free internet and cable TV. Also heavy traffic which equates to more sales. Employees also get a lot of discounts as Comcast has many partnerships with big companies.
good,The pay is awesome. Even if youre entry level and have never worked in a call center. The traing youre given is 6 weeks in a class setting and 6 weeks in a controlled environment on the phones. They really prepare you for success.
good,"The company would be a very great company to work for if they fix the small issues and policies that result in a high turn over. Other than that its not my first choice to work for as in any company, but would be the first out of cable/satellite providers"
good,"I really enjoy working for the direct supervisors and Managers at the center. However, every idea for improvement is lost in the shuffle and/or ignored. Every question was met with politically answered with vague or let me find out for you. Always waiting on other departments to do a simple task."
good,"I enjoyed the great benefits such as 401k, tuition assistance and paid vacation.  It's a great company to work for with very relaxed atmosphere. Management at Comcast was always very helpful and hands on."
good,"Typical normal day at work was fast-;paced. Learned PATIENCE dealing with customers, co-workers and management. Hardest part of the job is the final 4 hours of my shiftt. Easiest being the first 4 hours."
good,"Good company, great benefits.  The nature of the work though is very stressful and draining as most of the customers who call in already have an ""I hate Comcast""  attitude.  This makes it even harder to turn them around.  Many times I could not solve a problem no matter what supervisor, department, etc. I talked to. Very frustrating at times.  The PTO was amazing though.  They give you alot of time."
good,"worked both market/divisional and corporate - teamwork at the divisional level is definitely a positive experience, I met some incredible people over the years."
good,Enjoy co-workers and have managing a  team with a good mix of new hires and tenured agents. Best part is building relationships and maximizing potential of my team.
good,A typical day would be answering non-stop telephone calls and getting a bad review if you have to pause your call queue to use the restroom. I'd like to have control of my bowel movements there Comcast. I learned not to work in customer service call centers. The job is not for me. Management was brutal. I was denied assistance by a supervisor a few times. The co-workers were OK. The hardest part was knowing that there was non-stop calls. The most enjoyable part was the discounted cable bill.
good,"Door to door sales with comcast is a hard sell. Comcast has so many unhappy customer. If they could get their customer service in line, sales would become much easier."
good,what made the job were my coworkers I don't think with out that team it would have thrived now I see it going down hill because of the type of people getting hired not really knowing to much about customer service they are hurgry for only sales in stead of making the customer satisfied when you fix thir problems the sales will come easily one must be focused on all aspect not just one or you will not thrive to your zenith
good,"Comcast is great company to work for, but a decent amount of red tape with policy and procedures. The most enjoyable part of my current job is that I love some of my collages I work with and being able to touch the lives of my customer in the way I give my all in helping them with there accounts etc...."
good,"The days starts with opening the office and verifying cash drawer,then doing the daily conference call to discuss sales and customer satisfaction survey. We open the doors and receive payment and post to the customers account, discuss billing and any customer concerns, make any corrections needed or submit adjustments for approval as needed. Set up installs, schedule trouble calls, set up disconnects as requested by customer. This job requires a lot of patience and product knowledge. We are constantly training on existing products and customer satisfaction. Management insures that we have all the tools to do so. My managers and co-workers are always available for questions and/or help with difficult accounts. The hardest part of my job is I have had to attend multiple funerals, you become attached to your regular customers and it is very difficult to lose them. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and gaining their trust and respect."
good,"My overall experience working as a sale-rep for Comcast has been relatively positive. I love the overall work environment the company provides. The upper-level staff is very quick to address any potential problems that may hinder the overall productivity of the employees and the company overall. "
good,Comcast is a good place to work.  Good benefits from the get go.  I have made many friends here that I will miss.  It is a growing company and the biggest part of the time they are for the employee.
good,"Great entry level sales opportunity, parttime work that offers benefits. Great environment! Hardest part is to overcome bad customer service experience,"
good,"great benefits , free cable & internet. i just feel as if this company doesn't really care for their employees. they cut the pay without notifying us."
good,"This was a very stressful work place, the system was very inaccurate at times and troubleshooting was always mandatory , however the benefits & wages were exceptionally well."
good,"Helping technicians with their orders, inventory monthly, stocking  and testing equipment. I learned quite a bit about the cable and internet business."
good,It's a great place to work at with good people. The atmosphere is pleasant. I wish I was a full time permanent worker there to enjoy all the benefits that comes with working there.
good,"Comcast is good to their employees, we get free cable and lots of discounts, however frequently have customers who are highly dissatisfied. Their is no support system where I work. We frequently have to refer customers to customer service where they have to wait on hold for hours."
good,A typical day consisted of checking email first thing in the morning and began to take phone calls in 10 min. Helped to resolve billing issues. Gave refunds and promos when required.
good,"The benefits are the main reason why I have stayed with this company all this time. I feel that the employee turn-over rate is too rapid, making the existing employees inexperienced and unable to assist customers in a successful manner. I have been part of the customer service department for two years, answering general billing questions and helping out with tech support. I then became part of the Retention department that basically helps keep customers maintain their Comcast service instead of what they initially called to do, which is to cancel service. We try to ""sell the value"" of the current service they have, and when that doesn't work, we give them discounts or repackage them to lower the bill. I believe the hardest part of the job is trying to keep the customer happy when the promotions that were available were not available for long, or not available in all areas that we serviced, therefore, making it longer for us to find something suitable for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work amongst a diverse environment, with people from all cultures."
good,"It was overall a very tough job and you had to have thick skin. You answered call, helped with payments, added lines of business, calmed down angry customers, got customer over to survey line and even did technical support."
good,"As a call center supervisor, I arrive prior to my direct agents, to plan my day to include team huddle topics, conference calls, and impromptu meetings with agents.  Once co-workers are in, it was important to speak with each agent, share their previous KPIs from the day before and set action plan to assist with areas of opportunity."
good,"Comcast is an OK place to work, If you like to explain yourself over and over. The managemnt is very supportive and their is great job security. They give everyone a chance to move up once you get your numbers together and show interest that you want to succeed."
good,"The typical day at work is mainly taking payments, scheduling technicians, and exchanging hardware."
good,"Comcast is a fast paced environment company that is always changing. You have to be open to any type of customer that calls your line and be willing to assist no matter what the circumstance is. You can grow here and make great friends along the way. A call center job is not easy and not for everyone, but if you have great people skills you can go far here"
good,A typical day of work as billing agent would consist of logging into your station and taking back to back call with customer who are requesting  you to provide them with a service and or credit.
good,"Received inbound calls part-time "
good,"Its a good place to work, but not so good hours to work. Management is great, they are always around."
good,"Great working environment if you are not paired with a micomanager.  Rules, SOE & policies are constantly changing so you must adjust well and embrace change."
good,I loved my job pay was not that good at all but I loved my schedule.
good,While working for Comcast I increased my proficiency in meeting deadlines as well as prioritizing multiple tasks.Each day was full of challenges when working with multiple sales representatives and corresponding with different departments to resolve customer issues.
good,"work starts at 7:30,gets out whenever your done."
good,"As a retention specialist, my job was to retain customers who had intentions of canceling their service.  It was very important to build value in the product and a the same time find out as the exact reason behind each person reason for canceling the service in order to maintain them as a current customer."
good,"Comcast is great place to work, however like any other company there are areas that need adjustments, for example all Mangers and Directors do not make good leadership, this is a taught behavior. I found in my years with the organization that mentors are needed in all locations. I enjoyed my years with Comcast working with all leadership from internal and external people this allowed room of growth and advancement when the opportunity presented itself. "
good,There is great benefits such as free cable and flexible schedule.. lately departments has been closing down and employees are forced to go elsewhere
good,Enjoyed working here. pay was great and commission was good. I loved helping customers. I enjoyed the atmosphere and employee and management.
good,"Call center closed down, but overall i enjoyed my time working for Comcast cable."
good,"My experience was both great and not so great. I enjoyed the freedom as far as taking home work truck. I enjoyed the benefits package which included free cable service. The compensation left a lot to be desired. The work performed by Comcast Technicians could be comparable, if not more, than the work done by technicians working at AT&T, with a higher rate of pay being given. The testing and work that needed to be done just to bring a viable signal to the demarc alone could have warranted a higher rate of pay. Work performed inside the home was a whole other matter. Time and locale of jobs was another daily battle. Experience would have been better had I had the chance to advance as others had. As I started my employment with Comcast my immediate supervisor was on his way out, so that put my advancement in jeopardy, due to new supervisor needing time to get up to speed. Had I known that I would have spoken to the right people instead of sitting idly by waiting for others in management to assist in my dilemma."
good,The job is fairly good. You learn something new everyday. The management is friendly and helpful. Since its a call center you barely have time to talk to your co workers. Only on breaks and lunches but those aren't that long. The hardest part about the job is home office's expectations. The calls require alot more patience and time. The most enjoyable part is making a customers day.
good,"A typical day of work starts with multiple morning deadlines. Once deadlines are taken care of, I handle day to day responsibilities. Management and my co workers are great to work with. A fun and comfortable environment was created here. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with and the trust that my team and managers have in me."
good,Working for comcast help me grow into my customer service role more. I feel that I am stronger in communication and desclating customer situations.
good,"Great benefits and culture, limited advancement opportunities"
good,Fun place to work.
good,"Great job security. Challenging but a fun workplace. Great, helpful peers. Definitely teaches you patience and how to time manage and utilize analytical skills. Very fast paced."
good,"Loved the Dynamic , Dealing with Customers , and Management was very Professional. Coworkers developed Friendships , but During Business Hours , kept it very Professional. Suited me well. I wish I could have kept working here , as Overtime was great , so were Benefits , but when the Closures and change to ""Virtual"" came , unfortunately it was not sustainable."
good,My experience with them wasn't very long but it's been a good additional asset to me regarding what i had to learn from them.
good,"Comcast is great for people that are just getting out of High School. Their benefits are pretty good, they also offer 401K which is a great perk and discounted cable, internet and phone service. A typical day at work would consist of reading emails regarding outages, promotions that we are offering among various other things. I sign in and begin to take calls. My first break which is 15 minutes is an hour and fifty minutes after getting to work and my lunch break is 5 hours after I've been their which is for 30 minutes. We do have the option to choose our lunch schedule, whether it's for 30, 45 minutes or 1 hr. I have another break 2 hours after lunch which is also 15 minutes."
good,Heavy customer service long hours mangagement is good. Typical day at work is heavy muti tasking
good,"Stressed , not enough pay for what customer service do, plus customers are very rude and racist and management doesn’t do anything for that*. Third party contractors doesn’t know or follow guidelines"
good,"Having worked in the mail room the3 team and cast was amazing to work with however management is ill prepared on how to deal with employees and actually manage beyond empty words and promises, poor rotating schedule changes, that can happen on a whim. 4-5 people calling out at one time leaving triple the workload for others and constantly shortstaffed."
good,worked there for over 12 years was one of best experience in my life. I enjoyed my responsibility as a business class tech and interacting with the customers.I enjoyed the team work we had and the fast pace environment.
good,"Can be challenging and dangerous at times. Work days went by quick when in the field. Work Place was great with a great open door policy. The most enjoyable part of the job was great pay, the freedom of managing your own day, and the Team."
good,"Working here was not to bad. I did not get paid enough for the job we had to do, but Comcast as a whole does their best to try and keep the rapport up. They, as always, can not make every one happy. Sometimes this job is just not a good fit for some people. For me it was not what I was looking for."
good,if you excel at sales then you can excel here.it is the best place for more sales than customer service. i came from a customer service background and it wasnt the best place for me.
good,"I've worked for Comcast/Xfinity for 6 years, the company has changed a lot since being employed. I've changed job titles 3 times with career advance from just a billing agent to a billing specialist now I'm currently a Customer experience professional my job duties are repair ,retention , and billing. The staff is friendly and motivating. recently i started working from home the experience has been successful but i do miss the call center environment."
good,Job was great when it comes to compensation.  Not so great when it comes to safety.  I worked there for about two months before I was robbed going door to door trying to sell comcast products.
good,"I truly learned a lot about billing, sales of Comcast products in the 5 years of employment. I also was part of the launch of Comcast telephone service."
good,Co workers and management are great. Open door policy. But the stress of dealing with mean customers high demands to retain them and still meet the quota.
good,"The most frustrating thing is how often the comp plan goes down.  Also, coachings happen often, and it seems not matter how good your numbers are, there is always more you should be doing and better."
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for, the people are great, the job can be stressful, always keep on your toes and keep up with the technology and constant change. Anyone that wants to keep abreast of technology and work with customers this is the place for you."
good,"billing, solving issues, supervisor roll, retention, customer services. This is a everyday and take about 388 call a month. Training and assisting peers."
good,I worked under a decade within this company and Management was excellent. They showed a great interest in advancing employees by setting up career pathways and putting them in a position to be successful. The perks and benefits were some of the best I have ever seen from an employer. Unfortunately my career path lead me elsewhere in which I would of gladly stayed with the company if the opportunity presented itself
good,"Comcast was a great place to work . the employees became my family , my manager and supervisors were awesome to me . admin supervisor needs help and the change of policies and how they get to agents was stressful not all of us got the same information ."
good,I worked at a call center.  It was a sales environment.  It has been a while since I worked there and I was only part-time.  It was great hours for what I needed at the time.  They encourage promotion.  They seemed to want to see you succeed.
good,"they teach you everything"
good,culture is different now made the work place unfavorable. too many restructures a new manager almost every year. lots of good people to work with. in spite of popular opinion everyone at Comcast took their jobs to heart.
good,"the environment was good, co-workers and management was great, but doing collections can be really hard the customers can make the job difficult. It is unfortunate but you will run into customers that create a crisis situation"
good,They offer great hours for part-time but the pay doesn’t match your work ethic. The place of environment is very calm and secluded. Management works well with associates to make sure your on the right track.
good,Comcast provided a great benefits the Alpharetta location was a fun environment with some room to grow.    The pay has change drastically not worth the drive anymore .
good,"I started with Comcast as a way to support my expecting child. Now that she is here I want to secure myself in the career field in which I actually enjoy. I would recommend this company for those looking to start themselves with any kind of experience. This company provides the tools for success, it is really up to the individual to use these assets to their advantage."
good,I have grown out of that type of atmosphere and want to start my life passion. It is very competitive but you can make good money and meet a lot of great people!
good,"Had issues with plenty managers and confusion with managers discretion and organization. "
good,"I did collections for Comcast, Yes a very stressful job... but the environment and people i worked with were Amazing, Fun, and Positive! That's probably the thing that i miss the most!! "
good,Very good place to work at but high turn over rate. Besides that comcast has alot of very good benefits and pays there people very very well. Take a shot.
good,The one thing I miss the most are the people. Everyone was so polite and helpful. The management was great and especially the training staff! I wish all employers had extensive training like Comcast does.
good,"You will work a lot and always have security but not much time with your family. Ive been here for a little over a year, been promoted a few times; not so great but its not all the money ill be seeking for."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Comcast in the warehouse, it was my first warehouse job and i learned a lot."
good,Lots of training and time to learn. Long 10 hour days but only had to work 4 days a week. I recommend the job for anyone who is single and has a lot of time to put into it.
good,"Decent pay, nice bonuses and prizes every month. Sometime customers can get on your nerves because there bill is high. But eventually you become numb to it. Can have fun there, just do your job, pretty simple."
good,"The incentives are amazing. They have to be to put up with some of the customers you get. It's a great place to work, just takes a certain kind of person."
good,"Receiving incoming calls assisting customers with billing, Helping to make sure all services are set up and working properly.   Educating customers on products they don't have."
good,"It took over 6 weeks to obtain my badge to enter the building. It took over 4 weeks to get my laptop. Consultants sit on the end cap of desk rows with barely any elbow room. "
good,Great job environment how ever the metrics were not fair to employees.  The employees where at a disadvantage resulting in low wage increases 3% max yearly.  15 cent raise was the normal after working as hard as possible and exceeding all expectations.
good,"I work tickets and take calls for technical support. My department is highest level of support customers can talk to you. I enjoy my co-workers we laugh, have fun and support one another. The hardest part about my job is when agents improperly transfer a customer to my department giving them false hope and they are angry with me and wants to talk to my supervisor."
good,I loved working with our valued customers. I was always going over and beyond to make our customer happy and meeting their needs.
good,"very challenging"
good,offers a lot of oppertunities and is frequently changing. You can make a lot of money and commission just by doing your job. the customers can be very hard to get through
good,"As Sales rep. for Comcast Spotlight, I sold 30 second commercial spots during cable television shows.  There were several reps in the same assigned territory. Reps have to keep a running list of accounts working and keep up the contact or lose the account. The hardest part was working with small business with a limited budget that also has to spend a couple of thousand to get the commercial produced before moving forward with the schedule. We made recommendation  and helped with the connection to various design studios. There was also competition with the Networks.  Presentations and due diligence did not always lead to an order. I enjoyed the putting together the Power Point presentation and presenting to groups. The hardest part was the rejection after much time and effort in the presentations. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the YES and securing the contracts."
good,"Currently I support a fast paced location within the Technical Operations Department Supporting the Technical Operations Management Staff, Technicians, and Engineering Department."
good,"Working for Comcast has been a tough experience in sales. With no good lead source, it is hard to meet your monthly quota. The best part about the job was my coworkers, and free cable for being an employee."
good,"Great place to work, very versatile workforce.  Free cable, internet and reduced phone rates. Excellent vacation and leave packages available to all."
good,Its a great company with great benefits that allow its employees the chance foe advancement. I also hated the fact that I constantly kept getting moved to different supervisors team.
good,Very good company to work for. Pay was very good and they were ample opportunities for advancement. Positive work atmosphere
good,"I loved my time at Comcast. The job was stressful as all call centers can tend to be with people yelling at you for 8 hours or more a day. Tools and resources were limited, but at my site location in Orlando we always found a way to gather information and the management team was the best i have experienced in employment in such a large corporation. Site closed with 4 weeks noticed."
good,Great Company to work for... More training involving the software that you need to work with on a daily basis.  Managment/Supervisors need more training to be able to help there teams when needed.
good,"Answer calls and help customers with any technical issues that might be having with their internet or phone. "
good,great place to work fast paced call center very organized. I took inbound calls and help assist customers with various needs
good,a good company with very good benefits.  strong on teamwork. flexible work times
good,connect to phones responding to customer about their dissatisfication with the company. attempting to recover their business with company.  Learned to be convincing.  Management was present on the floor at all times.  Co-Workers were unprofessional and uncooperative..  there was nothing hard about the job.  enjoyed free cable
good,Every day you take calls and make atleast two sales. Compute thise sales. Set up install dates.
good,"At Comcast, you must take the days as they come. Working in a call center, some days you'll be busy and some days it will be dead. Management needs to be improved because when you do something incorrectly, every manager has a different way they want something fixed so nobody is on the same page. The pay is good, commission could be better. I enjoyed it when the call center always had competitions between everyone and always gave big items away like computers and televisions. Its fun, it just has its down points."
good,It was very productive; everyday was a new challenge which kept the job interesting. It motivated me to always be prepared.
good,"Ability to work indoor and outdoor,dealing with complicating wiring circuits and easy troubleshooting on electrical and electronics technology "
good,A typicfal day at work would be busy. I learn about the cable business. The management is fine and the co- workers are fair to get along with. The hardest part of the job would overlaping calls. The most enjoyable part of the day would be end of the day
good,A typical day at work would be extremely fast paced with back to back incoming calls. Learned to troubleshoot computer issues including wireless connections. Enjoyed educating customers on technology and easy steps they can take to avoid call backs.
good,I enjoyed my career and I highly respect my my co-workers.
good,Travel
good,"A typical day at Comcast was reviewing my daily clip in the morning to see what my jobs consisted on for that day. I would dispatch out to my first job at around 8:00 a.m. The majority of the jobs included installing or replacing equipment, sometimes I would be called out to repair defective equipment. I learned a lot about computers while working for Comcast. The management at Comcast was great! They were very helpful and always made themselves available. My Co-workers at Comcast were always willing to give a helping hand which made the job much easier when I had questions I needed answers to right away. The hardest part of the job was learning how to operate all the different type of computer programs. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,work benifits are great and they value you as an employee it is an overall good company to work for.
good,Worknggg inn comcast call center was like working with family. The pa was great and the supervisors helped their team in many ways. I learned to be a strong leader and listener.
good,I put in 37 years in the northeast part of the country then moved south. Job gave the opportunity to stay in a position you liked or advance as high up as you wanted to move.
good,It was not for me. Cold calling customers to upgrade packages. Having to rebuttle when they were not interested. Not being able to help those who were unhappy or having issues except by saying call customer service. A lot of people were unhappy and or aggravated. Not my cup of tea handling so many rude interactions on a daily basis.
good,Comcast is an overall great company to work for. If individuals can overlook the lack of empathy and and underlined promos used to trick customers into an agreement then there is no doubt that it's a quite enjoyable workplace.
good,"Not a suitable position for those that can't handle stress or noisy backgrounds. Lacks properly trained agents other departments cold transfer calls to your line with angry misinformed customers. The biweekly salary is low and doesn't balance out cost of living expenses and they put a lot of pressure and stress on keeping up with numbers, adherence and sales. Only pros is great benefits and co-workers environment is always like a family feel however at times if you need assistance you have a hard time getting floor support or a supervisor if needed."
good,great benefits but transition through departments is slow if you are looking to move within the company. pay could be better. casual dress code. fun place to work.
good,It’s a good job. The benefits are good and you meet a lot of good people. Most customers are a joy to speak with and my manager is awesome. It’s not my career choice.
good,Likes that the company promotes within. Need to increase compensation for Superviors.  Comcast also offers a great work life balance and is also very generous to the agents.
good,"Very competitive , metrics change every year. negative surveys about the company can affect your your raises.If you're not willing to throw people under the bus this isn't the right job for you."
good,"Being in a callcenter wasn't for me, I just couldn't take being on the phone 8 hours a day dealing with difficult people, but anyone who can do that and really doesn't mind that environment comcast has great benefits management, and treats their employees very well."
good,Management is a little all over the place. Great experience none the less. Would hope that they'd listen to employee input a little better. We all work hard and only want the company to succeed .
good,overall this is a great company to work for.  Downfall is management listens to temp employees which causes them to loose good working people without actually knowing the employees that are hired.
good,Nice place to work. Learn quite a lot. always changing procedures which is cool. Very nice place to work.Learning new procedures is great. No more to comment on this company.
good,Love the people of Comcast and the environment. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers and micro managers. Most enjoyable part was the people who are willing to go above and beyond to help and the workplace culture was very diverse.
good,"This was great job when I was in college, it could be stressful at times when getting angry customers, I had 2 managers who were really good people who actually new how to manage a team."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of always dealign with angry/happy customers. you would never know what to expect from a job until you arrived. I was always learning new things at the job. management was great, always there when you needed  them. Hardest part of the job was probably having to work outside in the cold weather and the most enjoyable part of the job was being on your own most of the day."
good,"Comcast as a company was great, the training and new hire structure needs some work. You get trained all about the product and value and then have minimal on turf training."
good,I enjoyed the experience. The offer wonderful benefits and the knowledge they teach in sales is exceptional.
good,"The hours are great and the company give you a chance for more hours, great compensation and benefits, management was phenomenal and the employess was lovely to work with"
good,This job is what you make it.  Call center atmosphere with contests and incentives for sales.  Management is laid-back and understand the demands of the job.  Advancement with this company is easy for performers and often comes within months of being hired.
good,"Being a part of Comcast was a different feeling but in a good way because everyone was kind to me and took there time to train me how to become the person I am today, I have excellent customer service skills, I'm very fast and work very quickly with getting customers in and out while taking my time to understand there situation. Best part of my job is making a customer smile. & its almost impossible to see me complaining about my work being difficult because nothing can stop you/me if you/me put your mind to it."
good,Its fast pace and I learned something new about the job everyday rather its with the employees or customers. Fun place to work loved my manager at the time.
good,"I currently work here and I must say over all i do enjoy ny job. We have standard hours, great benefits and my training/mentors were fantastic. But they sold a dream (sales consulting) that there isnt a cap on commission, goals are reasonable and you hustle and you get paid. Well sales go through seasons and during summer mostly its difficult making sales and we dont get much relief or emphaty. My only complaint-i wish we could get paid for every thing we sale because we are bringing in revenue whether we sale on one Triple play or 100. Also some of our judgement/reviews can be a little unfair."
good,A typical day would include a large load of payroll. This company promotes stress free work environments
good,"Excellent Benefits. Free Cable, Internet and Phone service. Unlimited commission."
good,"ok job great pay, supervisors were not very good neither was the manager."
good,"My job felt like my home away from home. I loved my co workers and adored my supervisor.. I am a people person. I would handle a heavy amount of calls and assist customers with billing inquires and offer services that are available to them that they have not had the pleasure to experience. My job would never get boring because I strive for the very best always and my goal was to get off the phone with a customer and leave the most positive lasting impression on them. Each person is different and the common factor would be they just want the best possible help with saving money in this tough economy. The hardest part about the job would be when a customer did not have the money to pay their bills and would be so emotional. The way I would try and solve that problem, I would assist them with what offers were available to them that would help them save. If that was not an option than I would assist them in downgrading their service."
good,I like working here the hours was great. and had a good support staff. always got things taken care of
good,"Planned route of 20 plus installers in order to complete a street by street change over to upgraded system, also ordering material on a weekly basis"
good,I was only temping at this position and unfortunately there wasn't any permanent position available.
good,The scheduled work days were 4 12 hrs work shifts with 3 days off. Didnt really fit my outside and would definitely not work with a college schedule which is really the main reason why I left
good,"Great place and benefits but like any sales environment. It's all about numbers. Some of the most punctual and helpful employees would get over looked because their sales weren't as high. Customers would return and complain, it's a great place just horrible."
good,"I loved my job as a Lead Dispatcher.  My manager was a wonderful fair person.  The human resource manager was a nightmare,  She was a manipulator and a liar."
good,"I wanted to stay longer however, the training was all over the place plus at the time my father and step mother were very ill and both had surgeries so I had to also take care of them"
good,"Comcast gave me the experience and confidence that one would need in a sales role. Working for such a company puts you in the fore front of technology, this give you all the tools you will need to succeed at your job."
good,The calls were basically the same once you learned the system.  We had a program that helped us to trouble shoot and if we couldn't help them then we would schedule someone to come out to the home.
good,"Its a very cooperative workplace. "
good,Worked with several teams to offer innovative solutions to network and telephony-related problems. Fun and laid-back atmosphere.
good,Typical day consists of non stop phone calls from left and right. I've learned that there is always a solution that can be obtained. Your coworkers are your sanity and your push to have a better call than the last on every other call. The hardest part is the constant phone calls and the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction that you hear from the customers and potential customer at the end of every phone call.
good,I place for advancement. It is very verisitale company. we are a fast growing company.
good,Good job great benefits not enough hours on the phone for 4.5 hours out or the day.
good,install cable internet and phone services for clients throughout the Chicago land area working with a sub contractor management was great so were co workers the hardest part of the job was climbing pole in a Chicago winter.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the people happy when there service was activated
good,"this job was great because of benefits, commission & pay. Requires a lot of attention as well, lots of standing on your feet moving around handling equipment"
good,Management and co-workers are amazing and have made the job fun in an otherwise stressful situation. You're told one thing about metrics and they really mean something else and the job is both rewarding and stressful when it comes to customer service. There is room to advance though it is very difficult to do so depending on the position you want. The company has become very focused on delivering customer service though pushing sales on customers is still a high priority over doing the right things at times it seems.
good,"They were an ok company, work with you alot, but there are some things that could be improved on here. The calls could be out of this world, but supervisor could have been more helpful. or hire more supervisor that new what they were doing."
good,"Great place to work. "
good,I was away from my family for long periods of time but it really was worth it when it was all said an done for my children. My bills were paid food on the table.
good,deliver food to resdinets  make sure they have everything they need come dinner time give them a chance to get go around collect off trays and take then down to the kithen and clean and get ready for the next day
good,"The culture of the company was great. However, the management was horrible. I really didn't enjoy working for Comcast. I do not have anything good to say."
good,"comcast is a very hard place to work for.  there is no help from management, the stress of making sales while trying to fix cust problems.  The company causes undo stress for when you don't meet sales.  I worked in repair, but I also handled billing, sales, and had to put up with rude customers and try to do this all with a cheery disposition.This job also claims that there is simple advancement, but that is also not true.  you have to qualify as a extremely highly effective person.  with the way they ride you, this is nearly impossible to achieve.  again, with no help from management.  the turn over rate is ridiculous.Good luck if you apply here, you'll need it"
good,it was a great to place fro m the supervisor and down but the manager they didnt really care what time you get from work you cant even voice your opinion without the threat of reprimended for it
good,"A typical day at work is always prepare your day before you get on field, you will expect rejections, door slam. when closing sale, its the best day when no sale it can be touch."
good,Business service great aspect learn allot of business operation 
good,"Comcast Spotlight is restructuring for the past 4 years.  It has been horrible for us in Chesterbrook, PA."
good,Benifits are good. No room for advancement. Basic dental health. Free internet and TV is a nice perk. Overall happy but management does not listen to thier employees
good,is a very fun and positive work place. everyday was a day to look forward to heading to work because you knew it would be a great day.
good,"lots of compensations for sells. Contests and Raffles."
good,"A typical day at work was a slew of uninterested men and women coming to work to kill time and get paid to do nothinh while the majority of the ones who worked, did just that worked. "
good,a typical day at work would be 156-200 calls holding. very busy from the start of my shift to the end. i enjoyed the fast environment. the floor managers were ok. they worked under strongs orders from upper management making the floor managers the bad guy. my co-workers were like family. the hardest part of my job was telling people there services would be disconnected within 24 hours if they dont pay there full balance and they pled with me that they only had half. the most enjoyable part was the customers I talked to. every call was different
good,"I won the National Sales Superstar Award every year for being top 2% in advertising sales in the nation.  (358% of quota)"
good,"I was an Indenpendant contracter and worked my own schedule daily. I was my own boss that made the job enjoyable. the hardest part of the job was working rain, shine, snow, or heat."
good,It was a temporary job if u went permanent u rate decreased not stable employ or enough to pay bills really not much to tell i learned tech support trouble shooting or assiting techs with cable phone install if problem occured monitored there routes
good,"The pay is great especially if you make sales, but it is so mundane and  gets boring fast. I mean...it’s 8 hours of talking/arguing about cable bills......"
good,"It just wasn't for me. Its nothing bad, I just wanted a change. The hardest  part is not being trained enough for the job, and having too deal with irate customers on a daily basis."
good,I do enjoy what I do. Nobody in this company gets paid anything close to worth it. I hope they change this soon as it would make the environment a million times better.
good,the customer abuse is constant and its a thankless job. there is no room for advancement what so ever. great temporary job but it wears you down and leaves you no choice but to look elsewhere
good,good group of technicians. management had outdated philosophies. they don't in-brace new Technics or new apps. to help technicians with  time management of their work load. Also you work late all the time to account for a miss managed dispatch organization.
good,"The atmosphere in the Spotlight Master Control Center was always a tense one. We were trained on new procedures ""on the fly,"" and then criticized, written up, and/or punished when we didn't instantly understand something. The people doing all the work in the department were often overlooked, while the people who did very little were often advanced into new positions or had new positions created for them. When a new position did open up, it was supposed to be made available to everyone in the department. Several times new positions were awarded to one particular individual prior to anyone else in the department being made aware of the positions' availability. Finally, we were a technical department, being run by salespeople who didn't understand precisely what it was we were doing. We were constantly under fire for following procedures necessary to keep the department running as it should for the sales force's clients, while the sales force would make mistake after mistake, as in not telling or not being allowed to tell the clients what should be in their spots, IE drink responsibly tags in beer commercials."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work, but just like all corporations, your experience is only as good as your leadership. "
good,"Be ready to work.  Comcast does not allow advancement for those who are looking for work life balance.  It is work, and that is all.  There are opportunities to balance out - but do not think you will get promoted."
good,"I worked for comcast for a little over 3 years as a sales consultant. The job itself was alright. It was a sales job, but you were also responsible for non-sales tasks such as equipment swaps, upgrades and returns, account disconnects, retention, etc. I was the go-to for information, training, etc but they refused to promote me despite having a clean record."
good,"The products that Comcast has on the market are incredible and leading edge. Comcast is constantly striving to make the products better and pushing the science to improve them. The people that work at Comcast care about their job and do everything in their power to take care of customers."
good,"Comcast provides great benefits including free services to the employees minus having to pay for any equipment fees. However, there is a lack of communication within departments and pay can be very low."
good,Job security is the main problem. Work is good. I like the new infrastructure for employees.  There is more to learn but without a job security it`s hard to give 100%.
good,As expected I was excited in the beginning then the bells and whistles faded.  Management turn around and promotions from the outside slowly take away morale.
good,"Always changing commission structure and lower payouts and higher expectations . I don’t feel like after dedicating my life to Comcast that it was appreciated. You don’t really have a voice. I don’t think they really care about their employees and that’s why the turnover rate is so high. On the other hand, the benefits were good. They capped my hourly pay at 11.75 and haven’t gotten a raise in several years, and it has become harder and harder to attain sales metrics."
good,"I like it here"
good,"A typical work day one would sign on the phones and start assisting customers with there mobile account / device issues, and work open tickets the job is not hard just pay attention to detail"
good,"I sit here trying to come up with words to say good about the company, and I am finding it hard. They did give me my start in IT, for that I am grateful."
good,Working for Comcast was the best thing that every happen to me.  I did not think I would employed with this company for over 5 years because of fast pace. My only concern was the culture of the office did not adapt well to the rapid changes  that took place as our industry change.  And to be relevant you have to welcome change.
good,"Comcast is a great company with awesome benefits. It employs great people with various backgrounds and skill levels.  There are opportunities to grow with the company and that is a win!"
good,"It is very stressful place to work. If you don't make goal in 3 months time, you will get terminated. If I would have know that, I would not have taken the job."
good,"Though this position was through a temp service, I worked for this company for over eight months.  I would have jumped at the opportunity to work for them as a ""regular"" employee, but no position was ever offered to me.  During my working time there, they brought people from the outside in and hired them.  Why would they do this when I had been working there all those months and knew the role they hired these ""new"" people to do.  I never understood this.  Though my position there was through a temp service, I was also led to believe that it was a ""temp to hire"" position, NOT.  Don't always believe that these ""Temp Companies"" will offer you a full-time job, because they don't."
good,I was in a higher professional skill level. The department was restructured and I was laid off after having built most of the standard practices. Quite a bit of internal politics.
good,"SIx weeks of training over 100 miles from home with weekends off. Never got the hotel reservations correct. Slow in reimbursement, still had to purchase personal tools even though most were provided. If you wanted quality and useful tools you paid for them. Senior co-workers worked the system to a fault that caused any new person to fail no matter how hard they worked. Zero chance of advancement even when over qualified."
good,Managment sucks co-workers are good but dealing with irate customers that are mad because of power outages is a little to much
good,"My typical day consisted of customer interaction via a call center. While the job was fairly easy to do the first call response policy is what causes Comcast to have a high turnover rate. "
good,Not made for family! Customers are very irritated because system doesn't work
good,"Overall good company to work for but work life balance is not a concern. If by chance you have good management this could be the dream job but if not advancement is very hard."
good,Pay was good good company to work for. Management can be alot more compassionate.
good,Opportunity for growth in skills and possible career advancement.
good,"Good job. Great people. Fun times. Aside from that,ever changing job description\criteria makes job difficult at times."
good,"attending a lot of customers, learn new skills on how to interact with people, great management, awesome fellow workers, nothing tough about the job, enjoyed my job in general no complaints."
good,The culture is not a perfect fit for someone who likes to work and not have to get involved in the office politics. There is favoritism displayed towards personnel who are friendly with supervisors and upper management. Hard work is not rewarded but rather scowled upon by the slackers who are promoted to management positions. The ones that always look busy are the ones who really are using their work time to get their personal affairs in order on the dime of the company. My office was predominantly supervised by mostly females. All male supervisors were slowly laid off or terminated before they laid my department off 2 weeks before Christmas.
good,"I learned a lot at this job, especially how to manage time. I miss this job"
good,"• Established cable, internet and telephone service at businesses and residences"
good,All of my coworkers were great to work with and nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my boss whom didn't care for me much for some reason probably because I didn't kiss up to him just came in and did my job. Aside of that the rest of the management team was GREAT always there when you needed them and understanding of every ones needs. Even if their home life wasn't great they didn't bring it to work like my supervisor did.
good,It was a great opportunity that started wonderfully and declined as time went on.   Management changed and the culture suffered because of it. Initially was the best job I ever had.
good,"A real day in day out job, the conditions are fine and there are overtime opportunities. No room for advancement and seniority has leads on moving up in responsibilities. It is a good place to work with good pay and good conditions. The facilities are nice but the management does not really give back to their employees for looking at who does overtime for the company. Appreciation is non-existent, a corporate place to work but still a job as most others."
good,I worked for them for a long time... It was good work. They have steady work. Good benefits and do give raises as well as 401K and stocks to invest in..
good,"No advancement if your supervisor doesn’t try to help you advance, no management accountability, every aspect of your job is micromanaged and metric driven"
good,Comcast call center management does not value their employees... The entire time you work there you are scared that you might lose your job at any moment for any reason. Most people do not make it past their 2 year anniversary. The pay scale is constantly changing every 3 months and not in your favor. There are contest where you have chances to win between $25 and $500 amazon gift cards throughout the year.
good,"I loved the benefits but there was very little room for advancement , the people were great but if you were not with the company for several years your chance to be promoted to off line or off phone activity was impossible"
good,Will explain upon request about my work experience with Comcast. They where a contractor position that was a good work experience absolutely. Thank you
good,I was already working for NBCUniversal when approached by my then management to become the Operations Manager for Telemundo.  I did not have a formal interview with Telemundo.
good,"Comcast overall is a great company, however there are constantly changes happening within various departments essentially providing for instability in your job. "
good,I enjoyed my work at Comcast. I was able to progress up to a point. There were several of us that got laid off due to change in technology. All of the equipment we used to work on was obsolete and systems were moved to central location Denver. I would still be there had that not happend
good,"The job is sitting all day you are essentially told to keep your head down and your numbers up with very little interaction with people in person, it felt like i basically lived at the location . when i went to work it was dark when i was coming home it was dark hardly had any time to me self it felt like."
good,Just like every company they have policies and procedures.   Its challenging and demanding work . Always requiring attention to detail and follow up.  Overall it is a good company to work for.
good,"You will be very over worked and not given proper assessments. the goals they want you to meet are not possible and they keep getting harder each year. the Sarasota office I worked for is very poorly Managed. I worked 9 years for Comcast in a different area and never had writes up's or disciplinary action taken against me. Since coming down to a specific Florida office I have got nothing but grief and abuse from Supervisor's and Management. They treat employees like garbage and all there responses to us were. ""If you don't like it get a new job then."" Don't get me wrong the company does have great benefits such as reduced cable accounts and 401k and stock options, but that is the Company. I really hope this office gets a  wake up call and gets some new management."
good,Log onto the system and began taking and making calls to collect on outstanding bills. Advising customers how they can make a payment and setting payment dates. Cancellation of services due to non-payment. Customer's were obviously not happy talking to a collection representative and there was a lot of Verbal abuse that occurred.
good,"Management is very bad not professional, pay is low depending on your department heavy work load, doesnt care about you well being , stalks you when you get off the phone for a second"
good,"Typical work day is from 11 am to 9 pm with breaks in between. "
good,"Comcast  is  great  company to work but salary  is not very good, although  we  have  medical benefits   provided by company  along  with the  bonuses"
good,Overall its a decent company to work for they pay you really well however some of the policis that they have are not employee based
good,"Good job, always something new with customers or fellow techs. Management can be a little unrealistic but that also depends on how you want to interpret it"
good,"Dispatcher Comcast Cable "
good,"High tech, job security, open door policy, great benefits."
good,There is no life work balance.  To much drama among employees and no management will stop it.  No one is constant with rules of sales and no real one on one training. The customers on  most part really nice.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and the different opportunities given to expand my knowledge with cable services in the mid-south.
good,Buddy system run rampant. Certain positions should be left for those with no degrees. Cash mang dept is easy work but kills your joy and soul slowly.
good,"very busy, starts early, work in all weather conditions besides lightning, install cable and internet services or troubleshoot problems."
good,"typical day answer 60 to 100 calls, answer customers question about their accounts, service. Assits customers in opening new service. Help with billing questions, and customer retention."
good,Comcast has awesome benefits. I love working for companies who provide great benefits/perks for their employees.
good,"inside sales, making calls, solving problems."
good,"Start late morning, Talk to people that come into the retail store, management was very slow to respond to issues, I had great co-workers that helped one another..I enjoyed most of the time I was at work...Talking to people and training new hires"
good,"Comcast as a whole is a strong leader in industry, provides a stable environment but at the core lacks strong leadership. Between the leads on the floor and upper management there seems to be a disconnect in communication."
good,"A typical day at Comcast was answering 40-50 calls. "
good,"Prospecting, Research, Hunting, Building Proposals, Closing New Business.  Love meeting with different people, and bringing in new business to the company.  Management is a mess, and tend to sweep problems under the rug rather than being honest, which makes that the most difficult part.  My coworkers and teammates are amazing to be around and very supportive.  Learned unique skills, multiple products, and know how to hunt and close business."
good,"Taking phone calls, great co workers, decent compensation but having to deal with billing and techincal support issues when you are in sales is not supposed to happen."
good,A solid place to work for with decent pay and benefits holidays and shift bids were issues everyone dealt with and overall a good job 
good,"I worked here as a tech and the job was really easy. Once you start, you are given one day of training and honestly that is all you will need."
good,setting up cable box for techs to pick up setting front counter with equipment needed for the day at least twice aday. Unload and load delivery trucks with equipment. Do inventory every day putting equipment back in inventory. Management was not always easy to get along with and some co-workers were a little to tight with management than should be. The harest part of the job was loading the trucks by hand if they were small vans other than that it was done by towemotor.
good,"Complete customer service calls on a timely manner, address customer service issues, and provide the best customer service experience to our customers. The hardest part o the job is the demanding hours that can create some issues when it comes to Work / Life Balance as we have to address family issues and concerns."
good,A typical day at work began at 2pm with usually loads of projects going at a time. Filling out the information of the customer into the cable accounts and assuring all your codes are correct.
good,"Verizon Wireless ( Hanover, MD) was typical work assignments, not much creativity or championing of change in the work in place."
good,"Typical work day would start out logging into system. You learn to adapt to change and go with the flow. What I like most about my job there is the satisfaction the customer shares when you were able to assist their needs. Also I enjoy working with my co-workers and management to ensure we get issues fixed, a true team feeling. The hardest part of the job are customers whom are hostile and harass."
good,"This position provided valuable experience of all facets of call center operations. The best part of the job was having a positive impact on quality measures cost savings, efficiency, and product delivery. My co-workers were extremely skilled and helpful in all team assignments. The hardest part was the commute. The call center is located in an affluent area that the salaries don't support living close by for those in non-management positions."
good,"I enjoyed being a technician and having the ability to solve problems and please our customers. Once becoming a salaried member of leadership the entire job changed, and I had no rights as an employee. I was held liable for maintaining professional relationships with my direct reports, while receiving none of those courtesies from upper management. I loved the work, but could not deal with the shady politics."
good,Not enough work life balnace but wonderful opportunity. I have two kids with special needs so I need a more flexible schedule and the option to work remotlely would be perfect if they offered it.
good,"A typical day includes interacting with different people, and being aware that you may have to adapt the way that you communicate. The hardest part was adjusting to the amazing new workplace. I clearly see that the focus is centered on technology and innovation; job security, not so much."
good,"Currently no job security at really any position minus management, however if you can secure a position with the company I found it to be a healthy work environment that promotes individuals success."
good,"Great benefits and courtesy services, however be mindful of which department you advance to in regards to advancements and job placement. thank you all"
good,"Comcast was once ""THE"" place to work! The worst part was their desire to out-source jobs. In particular, their customer service positions! The practice was extremely inconsiderate in regards to the customers. I say this, because the individuals they hired; they had neither loyalty nor integrity! Customers are constantly complaining about not being able to understand the representatives they are speaking with! Due to the lack of the company following up regarding such complaints, these out-sourced representatives think nothing of dropping customer calls! Comcast is horrible because the customers  wait times were excessive (payment centers). These customer's wasn't  even given enough consideration to have restrooms provided for them while waiting! On occasion, I'saw customers go to the side of the building to relieve themselves! As a result of them closing  local call centers, numerous customers have since left the company! This happened for several reasons:  Everyone in their service area were acquainted with any given representative, or technician who were left without jobs! I've been told, they felt their needs were not important to Comcast. Comcast failed to realize how important loyalty was! Right now, most of my acquaintances have since moved on to other providers in the area. Comcast felt they'd made wise financial decisions for the company, as a result, all they managed to do is lose a high percentage of both residential and corporate accounts. As for their employee's, they've scaled down on company functions as well. This led to morale sinking even lower than it had been."
good,Overall good place to work. I need to gain full time employment. Worked very well with others. I like working here although not enough money to earn. I might suggest it to others.
good,"Not treated like an individual.  Very large company that is very “numbers” oriented.  Doesn’t matter what kind of person you are, it is all about the numbers."
good,Call center job very tight and micro managed. Good people but the culture is very negative. Pay structure changes make for a very bad environment. Nice hire as director last yr but the structure creates  animosity amongst coworkers.
good,Culture isn't what it used to be.  They make it more difficult week by week to hit your numbers but closing in the walls.  Not sure I'd go back there.
good,The call center morale is very low. Incredibly stressful job and the pay scale doesn't reflect it. The highest starting salary is less than what they want to raise the minimum wage to in NJ.
good,You work alone which is nice. Discounts are good. It’s hard to get a raise. The numbers you have to make seem easy but you’ll soon find out you have to work 24/7 to make your marks.
good,Comcast is an overall good company to work for. The pay is slightly less than other similar jobs/companies. Benefits and perks are good. Growth opportunities.
good,Appreciated the wonderful benefits.  Worked in advertising and just very top heavy.  Too many big picture thinkers and enough people in the trenches.  National re-org was painful...months of no communication and so many great people gone.
good,"overall great compensation plan, and great benefits. very stressful and competitive work environment. needs more structure around career development ."
good,employees aren't treated equally. favoritism is prominent. favoritism starts and hr and trickles down into management departments. some ppl miss days for family emergencies and are penalized others wake up late and are not penalized
good,"It is to hard to take care of my family with the holy rate that I'm recieving. I'm currently living paycheck to pay check, the commission structure keeps changing. I am a leading rep with the company and The structure has taken such a dive causing over 1500.00 decrease in pay"
good,"Handle customer inquiries, complaints, billing questions and payment extension/service requests. De-escalate disgruntled customers, repair trust, locate resources for problem resolution and design best-option solutions. Interface daily with internal partners in accounting, field services, new business, operations and consumer affairs divisions."
good,Loved the company.  Hr at the location was unprofessional but the company overall is not bad. Great benefits and great hours for nonsalaried employees.
good,"Great benefits and perks, advancement very limited if unwilling to relocate. Company currently restructuring and even management is concerned about job security"
good,"I enjoyed the benefits of the job, just the people could have been better. it has great features and culture  .........................................."
good,"Provides LifeCycle/Account Management for Enterprise "
good,"Culture has changed at Comcast.  Began as fun, competitive, free-thing environment.  Field culture evolved into paranoid, cut throat, gotcha, stressful environment.  Comcast as an employer of choice is fantastic.  My experience was not."
good,"I decline to speak about company , it was in the past and i choose not to comment on comcast because that not the area of interest i am pursuing. thank"
good,"A typical day includes operating from your computer and start-up of electronics to better improve customers experiences. Assisting customers with sales, bills, as well as other issues. Management is on site and always there to assist in any way. The work place culture  is friendly but stuffy. The hardest part of the job would be the disgruntle customers. The most enjoyable part would be the experiences of seeing new faces and assisting people with home, phone, internet or home automation set-up."
good,"Door to Door sales running own turf with micro management and down seizing in company "
good,This company was only concerned about business and not their employees. My experience wasn't a good one with the company; I was pregnant when employed with the company and came to work everyday for as long as I could. As I got closer to my due date I was experiencing some difficulties and took the proper channels to request a forced employee hardship and was denied. I had no other choice but to just call out until they decided to terminate my position. When I filed for unemployment they denied it and I appealed it an won.
good,"I love my job."
good,My typical day at work starts off very busy. I check my emails for important updates to make sure I am up to speed on what is going on for the day. I log into my systems and take escalation tickets to work and resolve with escalated customer. I also chat with agents from the customer service department to try and satisfy a customer's needs and requests. I also take phone calls from municipalities to ensure that none of our wires are causing safety concerns. I am also active with our dispatchers. Many times I have to take on the duties of the dispatchers to make sure the customer's issue is resolved.
good,Great business not center loved interacting with customers and the employees that worked there but management is very underhanded
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. The call center in Sandy, Utah is a very competitive office filled with people that strive to succeed, survive and exceed expectations. A typical day involves signing onto your phone an communication with as many customers as possible, trying to build relationships with them in a short period of time. Unfortunately, many workers try to meet statistics so badly that they do not treat customers with the deserved respect that they should. It makes building rapport hard with each customer for the same reason."
good,"Provides good benefits and perks. The work environment is good, not great.  The middle management is lacking in leadership and communication skills.  There is a lack of proper training at the manager level."
good,Very diverse work place with great ideas but management falls short of employees. Management needs to be more in tune with employees and for Comcast to be making so much money in the Cable industry they pay their employees horribly.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, but I had no work life balance.  Schedule changed every 6 months and did not work with my household."
good,"I work in the warehouse from 5am to 2pm Tuesday through Saturday. "
good,Good place to work. Went through the change from just a cable store to sales center. Management was not the best. Didn't like ideas unless from them. Love my co-workers as we work very well together.The people were the best thing about the job. I took a team of sales consultants from 64th in the country to 7th. They saw their own potential and now on top of the world. The hardest part of the job was a manager that didn't like us take chances and changes.
good,Comcast is a great company to work for but like every other job it has its limitations.  The Atmosphere is great and the employees are generally very nice.  The best thing about Comcast it always challenges employees to exceed their expectations and create new ideas. They are probably the most innovative company in the Eastern coast.
good,"not a bad place to work, all about the $ and NOT about the customer. Great co workers  and direct supervisor but upper management are concerned about one thing,   themselves"
good,My typical day at work consists of servicing the customer and trouble shooting to resolve issue they are having with their products and services.  I learned how to manage time more efficiently with the two hour appointment windows.  Management assist with the day to day operations to satisfy the business and customers needs.  I must say that the hardest part of the job is when I have to carry a 28' ladder.  The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the satisfaction in the customer's voice on what a great job I done in fixing their issues with their products and services.
good,Comcast was enjoyable because it gave me the oppurtunity to speak with hundreds of customers on a daily basis and help them with their problems
good,Working in a call center environment I assist customers on a day to day basis with explaining and helping them understand their bills. I also assist with offering additional products and services to best fit their needs. The most rewarding part of my job is helping a customer in need.
good,"It was a nice job, but the management wasn't the best. I enjoyed the technical side of the job, assisting customers get their cable TV, internet and phone modems back up and running."
good,"Comcast continually recognized employees  with the ""Great Place to work"" committee"
good,Comcast is all about pushing the next product or service. Pushing the limits in technology. Work and collaborate closely with cross functional departments in coordinating activities and resources to prepare for network updates or upgrades in support of new products or services.
good,Managers were not consistant in information asked for help on. They also bent rules alot on who they fire and keep. You can have two of the same situations two different people yet two diffrent job outcomes.
good,"The job paid well if your performance was up to par. Their were always incentives for those individuals who worked harder. At times the job could be stressful, as far as sales goals."
good,"A day at Comcast is very upbeat and busy! I start by  pulling up all systems used to access customer data. The next thing I do is open my system to receive calls, each call is different I use all my verbal communication skills and empathy to assist the needs of every customer until each customer is satisfied to the best of my ability."
good,Constantly work on an Ipad setting up turf and playlist to work off of when you go out into the field. I learned the business side of comcast as well as the products and how they work. The hardest part about the job is the weather.
good,pay was good but slow to get a raise Service is so poor - let me count the ways - that I'm sure that their top executives utilize another method of pay TV or use a competiting cable company.
good,"installed cable,learned how to work well with all types of customers,we sorta managed ourselves we were alone during installs ,great co-workers we worked together if needed,hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers who were upset with customer service centers, most enjoyable part was being able to meet alot of new people"
good,The people that I've worked with within this company are team players.
good,"Management at the location in UT is awful,  they make promises for advancement then when it comes to honoring such promises they are not fulfilled.  You are essentially going to remain entry level if you start in that position. Unless, you know someone in a different department for an ""In"" or are friends with a supervisor or management. "
good,"On a daily basis I provide administrative support to a team of 15-20 people.  Most of the work is routine, but there are always side projects that come along on a daily basis that will pull you away from your routine.  Comcast as a whole is an incredible company to work for."
good,"Typical day at work would be managing your customer accounts and orders. Taking calls from clients and making sales. Following up with clients during outbound time. With this job i learned to talk with clients and making product recommendation based on there needs. I also operated various programs such as salesforce, workbench, docu sign and various billing systems. Management drives the sales reps to make quota and maximize revenue. Co-workers are helpful and you learn a lot from them when it comes to pitching the product and making the sale. Hardest part of the job is closing the deal on the phone and walking a client to sign the document electronically while you are on the phone with them. Most enjoyable part of the job is when you close the deal and submit an order."
good,I enjoyed the people other than my supervisor. They seemed to be out of a lot of the time and had no clue what was going on/
good,"A typical day at work included large call volume addressing a customers inquiries, sales and concerns, conflict resolution and providing expert customer service. I learned much on the innovated products and services through in class and online training opportunities. The hardest part of the job was the work environment. The seating was very uncomfortable for call center workplace and not conducive to long periods of sitting. . This lead to increase workloads, stress and longer wait time for the consumer when there is a high rate of co worker absenteeism. The most enjoyable part of the job was winning contest prizes, commissions and bonuses, as well as recognition for performance."
good,Employees very helpful with questions. Great staring point for a career. No advancement opportunities.
good,Comcast is a place to build your experience and challenge yourself. There is a number of opportunites within Comcast to build towards company goals and execute on a variety of agendas.
good,A typical day at work was answering all incoming calls setting up new cable accounts and assisting customers with all account concerns. I learned that customers are always right.Management were people who were representives first. So they knew a lot about the business. Co-workers you could never get use to because of the high turn over rate. The hardest part of the job was that the field techs were never on time to the customer homes so a lot of the customers would call in due to late or no shows of techs to their home.The most enjoyable part of the job was the contest the company would have with the employees.
good,"We start the day with a confrence call, plan your strategy and hit the streets going door to door selling services and making life better for customers."
good,"You may not be able to find many avenues here to enter into higher office, but you will be able to get comfortable within this one position. Good to help customers and be able to pay bills at the same time, but not the best for financial or leadership growth."
good,"It was fun, until you were left in the dark.  It is a mix of management and personal issue that true working performers were neglected.  Hoping my next company will have true and honest management skills, and praying hard they are not eaten by their ego."
good,"Comcast is a great company with many great benefits. However, lower level management is giving the company a bad reputation. They do not listen to employees’ needs, they only care about quotas. After almost 6yrs in the company, I was fired without cause..... hurts even harder that FL is a “no fault state”."
good,I worked at Comcast for four years . Never worked a sales job in my life . Was hired at Comcast and excelled not by the training that they gave me by the other employees who helped me . The training was pointless and hours spent sitting in a room and going to meetings. Management promised us the world gave us nothing but grief.  I was there for four years and the commissions changed Numerous times changing the amount of sales you needed for the amount of “ on turf deals” we needed. This company let go a lot of very good employees but still keep the management who is rotting them from the inside out..
good,"The job of billing agent at Comcast is very stressful. There are very high expectations when it comes to selling customers in that particular capacity and it was the most challenging job I have ever had. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ""Quiet Room"" where you could take your break and relax in a massage chair, also there was a ping pong table. The team meetings were much more enjoyable than one on one's with supervisors. Upper management seemed to have favorites and at times weren't that welcoming to new employees in my experience and that may be due to high turnover. I learned that I am much more stronger than I thought by even working there the time I did."
good,I enjoyed my job there and would  recommend it aside from the fact home life is hard to balance if you cannot give them all your time and run out of pto
good,"i came in and logged in on time. i took incoming calls. all different types of calls, billing calls, sales calls, equipment issues. the hardest part of the job was hitting quotas set by the dept. the most enjoyable was when you got a big commission check"
good,As an independent contractor your able to set your own work schedule which allowed me the ability to set hours around my personal life as a posted to having to set my personal life around my work schedule. Scheduling is about 2 weeks prior to the current work week. I've learned allot about empathy an call flow which helps move calls along. There's no management peeking over your shoulder which helps you feel more comfortable with taking ownership of calls. There is live chat rooms available in case you need assistance with a problem or in case your not sure how to handle a situations or if it needs further escalating. Working form home is always a plus but can also be a minus with getting comfortable and not having a change of environment. One of the biggest things I enjoy about being a independent contractor is working from home an not having to deal with office work drama an stress.
good,Commission pays well if you meet the set goals monthly but at times is unrealistic goals and working in a store evirement makes it tompredict the traffic
good,Comcast offers a stable work place that has pay increases for technicians that is based on performance. You skill and craftsmanship will dictate your success.
good,"great benefits with flexibility. great product understanding. product is one of the best on the market. depending on what department you are in, very nice place to work."
good,inbound call center for the billing department. The hardest part was management. I loved working with the customers as well as my coworkers. I learned alot as this was the jump start to my call center career.
good,"The seating and management changed all the time and sometimes you wouldn't even have a manager! In the retention department, the job at times can be very stressful."
good,As a field tech you get to be outside the office.  Meet with customers at their homes.  Deal with a diverse range of individuals.  Interact with people.  Provide recommendations for their service based on their conversations.
good,"Fun place to work if you are just starting out.  Commissions are not great but decent.  A great place to sharpen your sales skills.  Management is good and they always have fun activities going on.  Upbeat and fun environment.  Caution, fi you you are a older working professional, there are a lot of younger professionals here."
good,"Typical day in the Retention department is stressful. Management constantly makes changes to the bonus structure and there are several quality performance measures that must be met that are very ambiguous. Comcast has pretty good medical benefits, but their pay is not very competitive. Pay is very low."
good,"Good  "
good,Comcast has great benefits. sometimes the consideration to move up is considered only if you are the right fit for the position . Management is overall good.
good,"A typical day consist of preparing for opening by huddling, ensuring necessary resources are in place and functional for the agents before the customer arrives, being available for agents, customers and upper management. The environment was extremely fast past and requires a  lot of multitasking, prioritizing and flexibility. I learned how to continuously be flexible and to often change to meet the customer and business needs.  As a manager, daily long hours were necessary to meet demands.  The most difficult part of the job was meeting all demands without an assistant manager or administrative assistant.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the team and the customers, participating in fun activities, engaging team members in strategies to meet or exceed goals."
good,"I have worked for Comcast going on 11 years now. As with all companies, it has it's highs and its lows. One of the perks of working for Comcast is that you get free cable and internet. You get discounts for Xfinity mobile, Xfinity home security and for home phone services. The health, Dental and vision insurance is pretty great as well. They also have arrangements with numerous companies such as Avis and Microsoft that allow you to get discounts."
good,"The company follows its mission statement very well.  However, the company is so large it loses the ability to be an employee focused company and gives the employee the impression the customer is more important than their services."
good,"I worked with the business on a daily basis to ensure support and business needs were met as needed."
good,"Great place to be, good entry positions, open minded. great products to have and sell. I enjoyed my time here. great people to work with on a daily basis."
good,"Great company, especially here in Philadelphia, but some Management is still in the stone age. IE two finger typing, unable to learn new technology and tools rolled out. Burden falls on Supervisory staff"
good,"Inbound/Outbound sales leads from existing and non existing customers. Basic cubical work environment. Highly competitive Call Center Inbound/Outbound Advanced standard model. Calls are meta data vetted then tiered and routed to the appropriate rep. Very high turn over, average BSR 5-8 months. Must meet certain sales quotas to retain employment, 2+ consecutive months of  not reaching quota may lead to termination. Hourly+ commission discounted/free home services 401K"
good,comcast is incredibly fast paced and and you're being monitored every step of the way. its only for those who are quick on their feet and willing to be humble.
good,"I enjoyed my time at NBC and recommend it as a workplace. Sometimes it felt like it was management heavy and too many layers for jobs to move quickly, Otherwise, a good place to work."
good,"Enjoyed working for Comcast.  Great employee culture, but was laid off with no warning.  Two weeks before Christmas.  Would have been nice if they gave us option to transfer or take severance. They dissolved entire department."
good,"Relaxed environment, very little micro management, very collaborative environment. Direct manager is very family oriented. challenging projects. All the engineers are very intelligent."
good,"Comcast has great benefits some that not offered by other companies. Company Culture could be better, but over all a great place to work.. Growth seems to be for the select few"
good,"Company has great benefits if hired on as full time"
good,"Comcast retail is a great place to work if you are into working under stress and in a fast pace environment. the company is currently going to a change in culture that affects personal life in the way that hours are not set, working weekends is pretty much demanded and no room for moving or advancing to different departments. Great benefits: vacation time, free cable etc.."
good,"This job is very stressful at times. you work through the elements, Rain, snow, and sleet. Very high pace and demanding.  The culture is cut throat because everyone wants to be number one"
good,"management is consistently threatening employees with termination, even when you're only missing goal by one or two units. They have no empathy and if they were asked to do your job they wouldn't be able to. Yet, they act like everything someone other than them does, is not hard in the least. The only time they care about policies and procedures is if their job is on the line, or when they want to hold them against you."
good,Comcast is a place of occupation fixated on making a high volume of calls within the southeast region of the United States and proper employee to customer Sales.
good,"alright I don't want anyone to get misconstrued i worked in a call center for Comcast, a third party vendor something completely different than the actual store itself, Comcast is an excellent cable service we just do not service arizona."
good,Great atmosphere. Good place to make friends.   Good benefits and plenty of advancement opportunities.   Excellent clean working environment.  Management treats employees like a professional and with respect.  Pay is poor.
good,This was a wonderful experience but I'm happy I was laid off 12/13/17.  Management didn't seem to know what's was happening from day to day.  Communication was not very good during bad times and they really micromanage the sale staff.
good,"There is no advancement for women.  Management is narrow-minded.  Overall, punish the good workers for the bad, shady ones.  Allowed stealing to go on for years and now the good ones pay for it."
good,It was great at first. nut after the first 2 years they just stop caring about your well being as an employee. More work same pay! do more do more. It gets to the point you stop caring about the real concern which is the customer. You start thinking about numbers and how they can be better for you. That is a problem and what makes it stressful.
good,Comcast has many amazing things happening in the future.  the problem is they do not pay well at all.  The culture has a good vibe and work is progressive
good,Fast paced environment. Must be able to multi task and have full knowledge of the products and services. Must put yourself in the place of the consumer and be empathetic.
good,We had to call customers and offer free products to keep loyalty from the competition coming in the neighborhood. Toughest thing to give free products. Customers wanted to know the catch. Enjoyed it very much
good,What a great company to work for. I would highly recommend working for Comcast. They are a leading technology innovator and rapidly embrace change in and ever growing market space.
good,Great place to work. Would enjoy returning to work for them.Fast paced and high tech.Good management involvement and delegation to experienced staff. Worked in dispatch.
good,"Trained was wonderful, fun, low stress.. Once your 6 months is up, it sink or swim. Good luck taking calls that have no sales opportunity and expecting your numbers are good enough to be paid anything more than slightly over minimum wage. Constant criticism. Constant being yelled at."
good,I like working at Comcast. Benefits are good. I would have to say that the job is constantly changing for the better. We have improved customer service.
good,Month by month our commission is changed and lowered. It is a very stressful job. They also let go employees that had been here for years for younger replacements.
good,"A typical day for me at Comcast doesn't stop for any reason, it's always going at full steam. I deal with customers all day long, and while that may be ideal for some people, I find that it does not fit with my personal career goals."
good,"Working at Comcast is very productive, It's a fast pace environment One gets to learn a variety of things. A great benefit of working for Comcast is the ability to work remotely."
good,"Grandes profesionales, grandes proyectos, media remuneración monetaria"
good,"Being a front line supervisor, I was one of the first to receive training on the latest technology being offered to our customers and being afforded the opportunity to train those under my charge. Wowing customers when presenting these devices and services was a highlight of my tenure."
good,"Very valuable learning environment, Comcast offers a lot of training and the pay scale is top in the industry for similar jobs. Comcast is nationwide and there are a lot of opportunity."
good,"The health benefits, stock options and perks are great. I'm fortunate to have a small but good team of co-workers, but within my group (IITS) career advancement is non existent."
good,"You must be able to have a strong work ethic,  strong sales acumen, and the ability to be self sufficient.  This career requires an investment in building your own book of business."
good,Great if you like working at a desk all day.  Free cable if you live in a Comcast zone which is nice.  Personally I would prefer a job where I can get up and move around throughout the day as part of my requirements.
good,"They will work you and push you so that you able to make the productivity quota like most jobs but remember that this job is in the elements, and you can not be afraid to get dirty"
good,"hourly compensation could be more "
good,"Great company. There are some really wonderful people who are Comcasters. The job can be very stressful because it IS a sales job, there are always changes."
good,"You wear many hats as a Sales Consultant. You're a billing rep, you're a sales rep, you're a retention rep, and you're tech support. If you're doing these jobs correctly, management's job is easier. "
good,"Good pay, quota driven environment. Rules completely different for Door to Door than for Online and Customer service reps that can sell the same deals."
good,"events, sales, appointments, visits, single point of contact for the communities, meetings, trainings, and work with teams each team within the company."
good,"The company isn't the best when it comes to job security for many of the positions available, but the company overall is good."
good,"People in Management need to start from Ground 0.   How can you possibly lead teams of collection agents when you never worked on the phone before?  This is a classic example of not what you know but ""who"" you know and what butt you need to kiss to get to a higher end job."
good,This company offered a great deal of learning opportunity. The team work was exceptional and the tasks and responsibility were challenging and fun. Ownership of clients was priceless for gaining skills to further your career.
good,"On an average day, I receive orders, pull orders, deliver materials to offsite locations.  Manage a staff of 4.  Co-workers are great."
good,"Never in all my years of work have I had the pleasure of working with a group that cared so much about the customer. So much so that I now worry about every interaction and find ways to better myself, all on behalf of supporting our departments that ultimately support our customers, the ones that I work for and pay my paycheck. The people I am surrounded by are intimately aware of their impact on the customer, and every decision is scrutinized for ways in which we can better serve them. I am proud to work with such dedicated people."
good,management was horrible didnt feel secure with new management i loved my job but couldnt deal with the inconsistency of a manager who was never at work or would answer questions
good,Management was always disconnected from all the hard workers. Commissions changed every fiscal quarter it seemed. It was nice to give great deals and be on the customers's side. Very rarely was there much appreciation displayed or acknowledged for DSR's. Expectations to keep high demands seemed unreasonable at time but there was plenty of freedom and travel opportunistic. Order entry was quick and smooth.
good,"they pay sucks, but the company is a great company. If you ask me the travel is not really worth the time, because you pay to work."
good,"Comcast provides good training to further develop leaders, however consideration for those roles can be dependent on who you worked for and where you hope to go. Negative opinions can stifle opportunities and those being blocked have little hope of career growth. Some are fast-tracked while others never rise up."
good,"Comcast is a good place to work, however often the demands from management are unreasonable.  In my experience all positions are underpaid."
good,I've learned how to flexible and compassionate. the most enjoyable part are my different coworkers and assisting customers from all walks of life in different parts of United States.
good,"typical I answer calls, follow up on accounts, read & send emails, check my pay status and orders that have been installed from 8am til 11:00... 11:00-1:00 office time 1PM- 8PM  I am cold knocking doors. My position at Verizon prepared me very well for this position. Mostly I am in the field by myself. The enjoyable part of my job is helping people make a good choice. The hardest part of my job is knocking on doors in winter at night by myself, most especially when weather and roads are bad or when I am working in a ""not so good"" neighborhood."
good,The section I work for was very disorganized. Manager always late to meetings. Meeting had no relevance on sales. Each one was out for themselves. To put it lightly not a team environment.
good,Very good benefits.  Challenging calling environment.  Many customers were very difficult to help.  As a customer service professional I tried to assist as much as possible.  The call center environment can be very stressful.
good,"not great but not bad.  call center environment that is a great place to work if you're good at calming irate customers."
good,Great place to work.  Co-workers were great and stuck together.  The company was very focused on forcing the most possible efficiency out of a work day as possible.
good,"Working with this company can earn you a lot of money.  However, you have to put in the extra hours.  This company's tuition reimbursement program is excellent.  The people that worked at this company were awesome.  Management......."
good,"Financial performance is a major driver, delivering on key targets leads to increased visibility and upward mobility."
good,"My day consisted of receiving a print-out of current Comcast customers in a centralized area in the Greater Sacramento Region.  I would start at the top of the list on a street, knock on the door and talk to the person who answered the door about the benefits of bundling their program(s) or possibly upgrading their current services to better fit their life style (i.e. HD, Internet or Movie Channels).  Sometimes, I would install their service(s) on the spot as I was equipped with a complete tool belt, cabling, and boxes."
good,The company as a whole is excellent.  The benefits are great and the pay is average considering the job requirements.
good,I have been with company for 5 yrs before switching to this dept. I have earned 3 weeks vacation. You can never get time requested. Althought they give you 6 personal days and 2 floating holidays you can't use. if you take personal time you can only use 4 sick days or you get an unexcused absence. Even in the event of emergency you can only use 4 personal days to way off a unexcused warning. they do not pay you for any unused vacation days.
good,"A typical day at Comcast can vary. Some days it can go by fast and be filled with laughter with everyone making sales. Other days can go by slow with the phones mostly dead. The great thing about my co-workers is that everyone has so much personality, so you learn a lot from the people around you and vice-versa. The hardest part of the job is when the markets are slow with the customers either not answering the phone or saying no because then you really have to push to get sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is really just the people you work around because even though it is somewhat a competitive environment, people are still motivating each other and helping one another with whatever we need."
good,"The job included ensuring everyone was at work and at their work stations at their assigned shifts. Monitored team metrics, analyzed trends, tracked inbound call volume. Had a lot of responsibility in the hiring and training process. Management was evolving but not quite where they needed to be yet. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching processes come together and employees becoming successful in their roles."
good,They focus more on sales than customer service. Long wait periods for incoming callers. does not focus on integrity.
good,"hard to advance if supervisor likes you too much or not enough, terrible communication between management, employees, and customers,"
good,The day to day is a typical work day lot's of work and at the end of the day it is very rewarding. Some but not all of management micro-manage and treat the employees like children. If the training is there than there is no reason to micro-manage.Room for advancement is always talked about but follow through is rare. It is a great company because compensation is great and if you get into the right department with the right manager you have no choice but to succeed. Comcast is so large and they try to have an across the board structure but that is just not possible. Overall this a great place to work with it's minor quarks.
good,"Call center environment so you are on the phones for 7-8 hours a day."
good,Answered inbound calls from customers who wanted to cancel or change service. Learned how to control the call. Management was ok. Just could not advance if you did not rub elbows with the right people. Co-workers were awesome. Hardest part of the job were upset customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have fun.
good,"was only with the company for a short time, the company went out of business after mismanagement of money from higher execs"
good,"My typical Day started by laying out plans to call customers and touch base with Leads I created before. This is a very self driven job where you can make money. My management staff unfortunately did not make me feel wanted or needed so I feel my job was extra hard because I did not feel I had the comfort of having a staff to help me in areas where I did not succeed very well at. There were other managers that did show that desire. Co-workers were very money driven and competitive just as you would expect in a sales driven model. The hardest part of the job was taking days off, not much quota relief making you feel as if you could not take days off."
good,Comcast has been a great experience. I enjoy working with everyone there. The benefits were great and there is always room for growth.
good,"It was a great job. It was just temporary. I got to meet with a lot of customer which I feel was the best part of the job. I learned a lot especially about the equipment and the new products coming out. The atmosphere was a comfortable one, employees were friendly and offered a lot of help towards me learning everything."
good,Loved it but the hours was interfering with my school at the time.
good,Met many great people and loved work. it was easy to learn but i was laid off since the warehouse closed
good,High volume call center. you can meet some very nice individuals to work with...
good,Comcast was a good place to work...Good insurance free cable overall good company..
good,"A typical day is monitoring the cable plant for impairments and when one or multiple are recognized, I call the proper technician for the given area to investigate and try to pinpoint the issue remotely to assist the tech in the field.  I have learned how the Comcast Cable Plant works and how it's maintained from the Satellite Dish to the customers cable box or modem within they're home.  I work very well with all of my co-workers, even the individuals that are constantly disgruntled.  The hardest part of the job is having to work nights because of my children.  The most enjoyable part of my job is there is always something new to learn and the technology is always advancing."
good,"All of my coworkers help out when needed in the work place."
good,I was happy at Comcast for many years! I still love the company however it is not the place for me to grow in a ethical and positive enviroment.
good,"Fantastic benefits!! Heavily discounted Comcast services - but the management lacks in any field in regards to being caring about their employees.  NUMBERS are all that really matter.  Though its a part of the generation, most management can't even do the job they are supervising over which can prove to be difficult.  Poor communication amongst departments.  As far as sales go, they make it harder and harder to make money, but they do have nice incentive periods sometimes.  Also open to having visible tattoos which is VERY down to earth these days!  I love my job, just wish they could allow relocations or even 15 min time off fluctuations due to child care hours.  Also less traveling would be nice."
good,"Day consist of evaluating locations to canvass, office time, and weekly goal setting with management, my co-worker are awesome in the attitude about team effort to win back former and future customers, the hardest part of this type of sales is the canvassing, because it is fuel dependent(car) we have to use our own vehicles, the most enjoyable part of what i do is making my customers happy with their selections of what i recommend.      "
good,High Volume Call center.  I would answer around 80+ calls a day in a 10 hour shift.  Must be very versatile because you are faced with a wide array of technical issues.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Comcast. A typical day at work was enjoying positive people, team players and making money. What i learned from my previous job is life is too short. Enjoy the benefits while you can because tomorrow is not promised to anyone. I exceptionally enjoyed my co-workers. We worked as a team and finished as a team. The hardest part of my job was pretending we were not about to get laid off when everyone knew it was coming soon. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people, benefits and the fun."
good,"A typical day at work, is very fast paced and demanding. I have learned how to work in a very proficient manner to achieve call per hour quotas, and increase sale goals. My co workers are pretty typical. The hardest part of my job is the customers who I am not able to assist because of their financial situations or because of our equipment is not working as it should and they are stuck with out services for days at a time. I enjoy my job overall, but the thing that makes me love it the most is the satisfied customers who feel a whole lot better at the end of the call. and I was able to put a smile on their face"
good,"Overall a great place to work. You can advance easily if you know someone in HR, otherwise be content where you are. Great benefits!"
good,Comcast is a good company to work for. They have very good benefits. They treat their employees as well as a corporate owned company can.
good,A lot of aspects of the job are being automated so job security and career growth is low
good,"It was challenging to meet sales metrics when customers wouldn't buy products. Fun, brightly colored office with use of workout facility."
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving at your desk logging in at scheduled time and taking calls right away. Including two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. The type of calls you will take depend on the department you work in, for example; Billing will take bill calls, Sales will take sales calls, and the Repair department will take all other calls. Very stressful job that can mentally wear you out, expected to balance angry, happy, and confused customers from call to call within seconds. Meeting statistical figures daily is expected of every employee."
good,Although I gave it low ratings on Compensation/Benefits...the people you worked with and for were worth the time there!
good,"This was a very enjoyable job. I like doing investigative, detail work and was very satisfying. I liked the management (my immediate supervisor) and I'm still friends with all my coworkers who were laid off like I was during the restructuring."
good,Overall i enjoyed my time at Comcast. The only reason I no longer work there is because they relocated my department out of state.
good,"I loved working for this company but I must say the whole time I worked for Comcast Spotlight(Advertising and Marketing Division) I felt like an outcast. I was the only woman there in my race. I constantly witnessed employees being laid off due to what they called ""COMPANY'S BUDGET CUTS"" in very short notice. I was laid off due to this reason along with a few other employees right before Christmas. I later lost my home and car and became homeless. I Loved Comcast but the division I worked for was not promiseing!"
good,"Normal work environment that provides cable television, internet, and phone services, Comcast provides the most services all around and in most areas throughout"
good,"I had bad hours, worked the overnight schedule. Was on a contract so didn't see a future in the company. Seems like there is a lot of turnover, but the facilities were nice."
good,***************************  Unlimited opportunities if eager to progress. HR support and employee services is above good.  **************************
good,"Employers should know that this company is one of the fastest employment progressing companies I’ve ever worked for. Treated employees with dignity and respect, as well as provided financial security."
good,This job was a great job to begin when learning about sales.  I was very impressed with the training overall and the great commissions weekly!  If the job positions were still available I would recommend.
good,"+ no micromanagement"
good,"Very good company as far benefits and incentives..comoany preached a family atmosphere, but when my mother became ill due to Alzheimer's and Dementia. I used wrong PTO personal time ( vacation and or holiday) company NEVER assisted me , sunsequently i was terminated even though i passed my score card, yet for certain individuals management didnt reprimand them"
good,"good experience, great benefits. nice 401k package. free intnernet, tv and phone, employee stock options"
good,"The training was fantastic, going over technology, product info, company processes, etc.  On the floor training was also fantastic with a lot of assistance from the tech group.  They were informative and so very helpful during training and in the sales environment.  The culture is ok.  Its great to build rapport with the training class but its difficult integrating once on the sales floor.  My complaints: be prepared for constantly changing rates for commissions, constantly changing supervisors, inefficient feedback while on the floor and a feeling of no long-term customer appreciation."
good,from the time I logged into the phone I received calls nonstop until it was time for either my breaks or it was time to go. With is being as busy as it was it made your work day move really fast which is always good.
good,"Good Company to work for.good pay and benefits with long working days."
good,"It is focused on providing multi-platform marketing solutions to reach audiences most effectively and efficiently. Responsible for all post-sale activities of assigned clients and associated campaigns, including post-sale stewardship, inventorymanagement, post-sale reporting, creating a strategic make-good/under delivery plan, and providing exceptional execution of client campaigns."
good,Working for comcast was a good experience. The down side to it was advancement was a little hard unless you where willing to relocate. At times the job was tough but manageable.
good,Very involved position. Fast high energy. Learned something everyday. Love working and talking to people. Love helping people with information . Great job
good,The work was a typical call center with high call volumes. I didn't necessarily love the shift I was assigned but overall Comcast is a great company to work for with great benefits.
good,"Working there wasnt bad the downfall was that everyday something changed an it was too much pressure with micromanaging to meet sales goal. Also, nothing was confidential the managers usually tell your business to other employees. The benefits was awesome, the vacation time was great as well. Hours was kind of hectic an the calls were repeated so the customers would get frustrated an strat cursing you out because it’s like we were harassing them."
good,"I've been at Comcast over 3 years now. Great place to work however pay has been going down since I started. Youll sell al the services they offer TV,Phone and Internet"
good,Our commission is not calculated by what we sale. It is calculated through an average amount made from the first 3 months of 2019 which is completely unfair.
good,"As a temporary worker, I was given the assignment to register Comcast employees for their annual Holiday Party.  This assignment was only 4 days.  Since the employees were in the holiday spirit, they were friendly and patient while waiting to register for the party!"
good,"I enjoyed working for comcast, everyone was very organized and well mannered. My fellow coworkers were friendly. The cafeteria had great food. I loved the free coffee everyday. Also we were learning something new everyday like different ways to keep the customers happy. Learning about new software or different ways to set up packages to sell.I also liked the competitiveness. It was hard to keep up with the fluctuating calls at times. Overall it was a great experience."
good,"Responsible for analyzing operations and performance to assure operational efficiencies. Promote strategy, develop, and implement best practices to improve performance metrics for Technical Operations employees."
good,Flexible work schedule thanks to my manager. Way too many organization changes makes job security questionable at best. Otherwise a great company to work for.
good,The work environment was sketchy to say the least. The employees for the most part were not as helpful as I thought they should've been. Easy work but it wasn't challenging enough
good,"Working for Comcast is an interesting roller coaster.  If you are looking for stability, this isn't the place for you.  The constantly changing organizational structure means teams are always re-forming & transferring  constantly changing the dynamics of the company."
good,"Within my particular group, as a contractor, I was not treated the same as full-time employee.   I know that was not the same as within other groups."
good,You have to fall into rank. Be a good solider. Stay within the box. Over the years the fun has left. Some directors are great and others are so full of themselves. The benefits are OK. Sure the free cable stuff is good but not worth sacrificing your happiness for it.
good,"Micromanagers.   "
good,"Overall a good company to work for if you like to make money but give up personal time.I would recommend Comcast to other job hunters.  Typical day at Comcast for myself which start around 10 o’clock getting out into the territory surveying and catching late risers, and many days I would work all the way up until 8 o’clock at night"
good,"Good job call center busy company "
good,Customer service representative with a objective to build report with customers discovering needs as well as solving problems. Responsible for selling and promoting all Comcast products and services that are both current and emerging.
good,In was great experience working with great people. Met a great deal of people.help a lot of families.money was on my pace it could have been better but I’m older now.
good,Contract position worked on transport layer voice issues created wiki page on how to fix issues after successfully resolving any and all issues position was dissolved and outsourced
good,I have learned alot from working at comcast they gave me a chance and i have taken advantage of the opportunity they provided.  I would recommend given comcast a chance if you have the opportunity
good,I enjoy what I do. It can be a fast paced environment and ever changing. Stressful at times. You feel as if you are part of something for the community.
good,My Manager at comcast is really a cool guy who doesnt micro manage at the same time is fully aware of the work progress. I lalways had his support and learnt a lot  under him
good,"Comcast is a fair company to work for, benefits are very good including a lot of fringe benefits you wouldn't expect.  Courtesy services are fantastic and health benefits are very good.  Company is responsive to change and cherishes feedback from it's employees."
good,"Comcast is a great company that offers great benefits. Healthcare is given on day 1. After 3 months employees get 8 vacation day and 8 flex days. Monthly bonuses on the products you sell. You can work as much overtime as you want.  However, the customers are evil and vicious. The customers will make you quit."
good,A structured environment that deals with confidential information from our multiple departments within the company. Daily functions always revolve around investigations and dealing with raw data.
good,"My 20 years at Comcast was great. I learned so much, from what to do and what not to do, communication is essential but effective communications is critical."
good,"There was always something new to learn. As technicians, we worked in teams. Together we got our jobs done efficiently and effectively to serve the public."
good,"Emotionally trying and time consuming. Great management, however the room for advancement was extremely time consuming and based on seniority over skill."
good,Im not a fan of how they lie about the calls that will get better yet they still come in wanting to downgrade and we get graded like sales instead. Why not grade us like downgrades and keeping customers if we're gonna keep getting people wanting to lower bills
good,"It was a great opportunity for me, and it pushed me to out myself out there and to be outgoing. They offer great opportunity to grow with in the company and excel as you learn,"
good,"Loved the people I worked with here, loved the type of work I did. I'm very good at explaining things to clients in a way they could understand. Taking their needs into consideration was my specialty."
good,Best place to learn technology with fun. They use all trending technologies in the market and one good thing is no need to require any special permissions if you would like to install any software...
good,"Comcast overall is a great place to work, benefits are great and they are really concerned with the community and family.  There are good days and bad days as it would be with any company."
good,"If you havent worked in the cable industry, be prepared for a shock. its a challenging task facing this type of customer base. i worked in the mobile industry prior to comcast and thought i had seen it all. not even close. Be prepared to spend most of your days disputing billing issues, and taking complaints about service related issues. on an average day, i pulled up around 30 accounts and looked at how i could add a service to their account while also hearing the customer voice their frustration with their current price or their dis-satisfaction with outages or other issues. i noticed that customers of utility company's feel much more of a right to treat you like a mosquito on their arm than any other industry I've worked in. on top of that, managers will stand behind you and babysit to make sure you are asking for every sale, and not taking no for an answer. Even if you obtain a sale, they will pull you in the back room and find something you didn't do right. Overall i got more negative feedback than positive reinforcing. keep in mind you have 5 products to sell. (tv, internet, home phone, home security, and cell phone) many customers are coming in for internet only for some 39.99 special rate, and you have to  try and upset them all 5 products. Its a constant grind with a lot of pressure and micro managing from leaders. however, your day will fly by because you will be infront of a customer every moment of your shift. the job does pay well and includes many benefits! in the year and a half i worked there, i saw over a dozen new reps hired and then fired/resigned in the same"
good,"I really REALLY enjoyed my time at Comcast. My Sales/Store Manager was by far the best I have ever had, and the Assistant Manager was really great too. "
good,"Comcast is a very faced paced work environment, that constantly changes. Great opportunities are available if you are exceeding expectations, and create a positive brand for yourself. A typical day for me is coaching and developing my agents, reviewing interactions, providing real time feedback. Also creating training session to drive performance. participating in cross functional project to learn business form different perspectives. Hardest part of the job was overcoming difficulties created by other departments the impact the customer experience."
good,"Good stepping stone position. A lot of room for advancement if willing to commute to Denver. "
good,"Good place to jump start your career in IT, lots of exposure and assistance from senior techs regarding the technologies and tools used in the IT industry"
good,: typical work day was assisting new employees with training coming up with sales strategies for new employees and making sales calls to potential customers.
good,I really enjoyed working at Comcast. They made sure you were well taken care of. I did have a problem with a manager who was deaf. He would lie and say that i said things that i did not.
good,"- Great company"
good,wonderful experience plenty of things to learn same as fts with the work but a lil more organized. Just things are not what they make it seem there at all
good,"a very customer focused work place in which knowledge of sales, service, and technological trends are instrumental in business success. The management and staff was very helpful."
good,"Always changing, when working at Comcast be prepared to learn every single day. The job does not pay well, so you'll need to work overtime to make up the difference, utilize 100% paid college to further yourself for a better life, or do nothing but suffer and complain about how unfair life is for you. The choice is yours. But keep in mind that with the transformations in technology and the ever-changing world, science and entertainment will continue its expansion with the needs of the people. As an employee, you must be willing to grow or be left behind, learning the lessons of life as you go or sit behind and whine like a child."
good,Great place to work and fast paced environment. I enjoyed my time at Comcast and the collaborative culture. Even though Comcast is a big company it does feel like a family atmosphere. A lot of room for growth!
good,Great company but difficult to get sales in the outbound business division. You can transfer within 12 months. Includes great B@B sales training. Good overall
good,"Fun if you want to learn a lot of things , lot of resources for you to learn whatever you want. Job itself is not complex as is with any other large corporation."
good,"Spotlight is a great foot in the door to Comcast - network. Not terrible, but not somewhere that someone progressive would work. A lot of antiquated thinking and a bit dry for a media group. Great team members that made the best out of everything."
good,"Comcast wasn't a bad company to work for despite the high churn rate of employees. The Nashville office regularly gave back to the community, and that's something I did like about them. That being said, the rate of expansion I believe was too fast causing issues in the system and not enough experienced technicians to properly diagnose and solve the problems in a timely manner."
good,Comcast-Spectacor has a fun and hard working culture.  It is an exciting place to work and has fun events for their employees.  They have good employee perks with Comcast cable and sporting events.
good,"The job was fine, that pay and benefits decent. However, there is a bias throughout the call center. Ultimately causing me to  leave so that I could have the time needed to finish my last month of school."
good,management was very up close but not pressuring. they understood specifically the individual problems that might arise. (seems like it comes from experience). sales though was one pressure point
good,All technicians work 10 hour shifts.  A common day is anything from full installs of cable services to simple trouble shooting of customers equipment. Hard work being hoisting your ladder around to get at arial cable to running new line through attics.  Id imagine in other areas this might not be so bad.  i live in florida and its hot. Aside from the heat the company has requirements that are basically impossible in some areas.  Some place are all newer houses with underground cable. some areas have historic houses with all arial cable. It can be especially difficult to do your job correctly while trying to stay within the time frames you are given. This creates a lot of stress as you can receive corrective action for pretty much anything depending on your supervisor.  The customers can also either be a joy or a nightmare. As a tech you are the face of the company. ON the other hand they have competitive pay and benefits that were the best ive ever had by far. My supervisor was also one of the best Ive had in any industry and as far as I can tell the other supervisors were not far behind.
good,"Worked here for 7 years.  Was really a great place to work for the majority of the time I was there.  Over the last couple of years, they have been going through a lot of organizational change and there doesn't seem to be an end.  So job stability is shaky at best, even for long-tenured, successful employees."
good,It's a fun place to work and i enjoy having the trust from management to work on things without excessive micro-management.  My dept. needs more opportunity for growth though.
good,You can learn career skills at Comcast while earning a decent living. You receive excellent perks and benefits. You work with people from all backgrounds and abilities.
good,"Fair hours and pay. However, poor management through leadership. Lots of preference within the company but still fair with promotions and pay raise. Good company overall."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Good people, good leadership. Great benefits, and work life balance. "
good,"great job but can be very stressful, between bad management and angry customers. Its a great job for the right temperament, but you are going too be yelled at by customers all day every day."
good,I worked for Comcast for over 15 years.  They offer good benefits and very good pay.  There was still a great deal of Nepotism in the organization but it was becoming better my last year employed.
good,Comcast is trying to change its culture with customers but the old timers were stuck in previous methods that was not customer centric.  Until the cultural adjustments are made by all employees their customer centered shift can’t occur.
good,"Good opportunities, but lacking in big picture focus at front line leaders.  This is evident in lack of communication about overall goals and interdepartmental communication. These things were being addressed before I left so I imagine things are getting better."
good,"I cannot speak to other positions within the company but with regards to being a technician in the field, there is a great lack of appreciation of the importance of that position that is supported by the low wages and introduction of more and more metrics that the tech must meet consecutively in order to advance in position and pay. The only positive argument to be made are the benefits that are afforded to every Comcast Employee regardless of position."
good,great place to work there is plenty of space to grow within the company if you are determined in working hard and meet your goals on time. they provide quarterly bonuses which is a nice way to show us appreciation
good,Comcast can be a great place to work.  As a company that is consistently trying to stay relevant they often make organizational changes which can be very impacting.
good,Ideal workplace for learning essentials but in need of better management and promotional opportunities. Work/life balance in finance is barely obtained.
good,"Budget keeping, calendar management, customer experience, employee engagement. Good management, a lot of changes. Career advance opportunities and fun working environment"
good,"Good "
good,"Comcast provided great benefits and worked with you to suit your hours. I enjoyed working with customers over the phone, but as a retention specialist I often dealt with unhappy people. Still, most of the time, people are reasonable and it's great to find ways to make their package work for them."
good,"Work here was awesome, you had other people always willing to help you. there was always some potluck and great vibes. Hardest part about the job was trying to upsell past cable."
good,Employment ended unlawfully but for the many years I was there overall iy was great. New management would not allow me to return after a medical leave of absence unlawfully. Loyalty is one of the highest paid positions at Comcast
good,"Comcast is like most other professional organizations, you are expected to preform well and are fairly compensated.  The fringe benefits such as free cable tv, and high speed internet are nice.  Solid tuition reimbursement and medical insurance is available. PTO and FMLA are encouraged if you need it.  Advancement is not particularly rapid and there are many very qualified peers vying for those same opportunities."
good,"I loved working with the team members, they were supportive and up to task always. Fast paced environment and we were paid commission for every job completed"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Comcast was talking to new people everyday and being able to win the back to Comcast. I enjoyed making the customer happy and handling all aspects of the account."
good,Had to work with members answering questions which can sometimes stressful. Don't want to pay bill but want every channel. Got free lunch and free cable.
good,"Comcast has a constantly changing barrage of products, and does a great job of training employees on each of the new assets.    The management expectation of the immediacy and level that clients will accept new products is crazy though."
good,Great job working by yourself but the overall training could be better to get you prepared for being on your own. Management hasn’t been much help when your out in the field and need a quick answer. Other techs are going to be your best bet to get through your job.
good,"Monitoring any visitors, vendors and other customers in issuing them badges to enter and exit. Routine foot patrol for inside of temperature controlled cool environment data center, monitoring temperatures."
good,"Customer Service	1999 to Present"
good,"This job is quite fun day-to-day. You get to meet new people and solve problems (eventually the problems aren’t very challenging though.) "
good,Comcast was the best place to work for. i like working with my coworkers they we very friendly plus they help each one another. When they tell you if you need help and you tell no they still help you anyway
good,"I have been at Comcast for over 5 years. I have not risen to a position that there is no where to go. I am no management. they expect weekends, nights, and holidays. The pay is worth it, if you are single. I have a family that the job pulls me away from"
good,"Good company to work for, but it changes a lot. If you are looking for long term stability may not be the place for you. Many jobs are restructured or changed in away that make things entirely different."
good,The cable package was great even though the service still suffered as an employee. We received the same type of bad customer service. I expected more but was thankful for cost.
good,"I've worked here for a long time, over 30 years.  I have worked with many talented people and have learned a lot.  I am very grateful for the experience that Comcast has given me."
good,"I was a customer account executive, providing internet trouble shooting in a call center. My schedule changed a couple times while I was there, and it was difficult to plan on what schedule I would be working as it was a seniority based system."
good,Great benefits and work life balance.  Great training opportunities and exposure to other facets of the company. This is a world class company to work for.
good,"Worked there 3 months, was hired on full time and then was eligible for advancement opportunities within the company. Very fast pace work environment."
good,It was nice working for comcast and learning more about the company and how the cable world worked. Compensation was okay it could be better but theres many opportunities for growth.
good,"Work day consists of troubleshooting and outstanding customer service."
good,"This position never stop, constantly on the phone. You must have a thick skin to listen to people's ups and downs about cable service. However, you did get a joy of making a customer's day."
good,Typical Days Work Consist Of Going Door To Door Selling Communication Products To Customers. Also Include Writing Up Sales Reports To Solve Customer Problems And Satisfy Customers Needs.
good,I had a great experience with this company. Going door to door speaking to new people everyday was a great experience in both accepting rejection and gaining more customer service experience.
good,"Recently there was a shake-up to streamline the direct sales force.  The emphasis did shift from activity to production, but its slowly creeping back to activity.  Work-life balance is a little off for direct sale,s but overall it is a great place to work."
good,Seasonal and Quarterly meetings which offered free food. The head of the call center at the time had an open door policy which allowed agents to come to him directly with any issues.
good,I liked it here I just needed different hours people were nice the management was good but constantly changing so it was like I was always meeting new people
good,Comcast provides great benefits and time off. Discounted service and great health and dental benefits. Customer support positions have schedules that don't work well with family life. Many positions don't allow for weekends off and the staffing levels aren't very good. Always understaffed and overworked.
good,"there is a ceiling at this company once you hit three years not much area to go after that.  there is no communication with corporate its al local constantly getting orders and new mandates and new company policies never reaching out to the company or its employees.  they may do small cell groups but ultimately local areas have little to no say or voice.  but benefits are good and the money is there to be made its up to you,"
good,"Choose not to answer and remain anonymous if possible. Its a very Diverse company.  Enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people who can not afford their bill,"
good,"fun place to work, good manegment, pay was good, nice place, it was good being like my own boss,even though we had dispatch,but you really work at your own pace"
good,"The only downfall is that Pittsburgh gets four seasons and the pay could be better also. It sucks to work outside during the winter, if it was further south wouldn't really have anything to complain about. It would be nice to get paid more, it seems like a basic job but you're held to a pretty high standard and deal with alot of nonsense. Other than that the job is wonderful!"
good,"overall company was good to work for, department had it's challenges - i feel this is ridiculous required information to require to apply for a job on your site"
good,"as a whole comcast is a good company to work for with decent compensation however within the last year there seems to be a huge disconnect between management and hourly staff "
good,"Good to work in diverse technologies across Comcast. The downside is a lot of routine work that offshore team want to avoid, end up doing myself. They try to push the routine work on you, leaving you less time for invocation or career advancements."
good,"Comcast offers several  opportunities for advancement, if you like to succeed, I would recommend this company. The people are great to work with and have an open door policy."
good,"This is a High-Pressure corporate sales job and Sales reps are kept happy with food and games and outings. For many it is hard to reach sales quotas, however quotas have changed since I left. Training does not properly prepare a new hire for the job and most of the practical knowledge that could be included in curriculum is learned on the production floor."
good,It is an organization where u can leverage to develop skills. Great motivation drives you gain more knowledge and utilize it in developing applications.
good,Typical day consisted of calls to new and existing customers who qualified for promotions and discounts. Attained computer skills in telesales.Culture was professional and very knowledgeable about products. Hardest part was the unpredictable markets that hindered sales.  Employees made the work place fun and exciting.
good,Fast paced working environment that has great benefits. Employee services are discounted and the health care is awesome. Job security was a concern....
good,Provide everything for technicians. Poor management at warehouse and store levels. Busy periods with some lulls. Management is loose at warehouse level and all ends side with technicians over any other department so if the technicians complain they are heard but warehouse and dispatch are very hard to raise a concern or dispute in. I learned a lot of the logistics part of the business and the free cable is great.
good,"-Great job offering flexibility, leverage of time, great pay and benefits, although limited in advancement opportunities and constant challenges and changes within company."
good,Very generous and family orientated. Great city to work in. People were excellent to be around. It's been a awhile and things may have changed like all corporations.
good,"Today’s call center leaders are routinely expected to be a combination of expert service provider, coach, trainer, mentor and motivator. Compounding this already significant challenge, supervisors are expected to put out daily fires, prepare reports for management and oversee agent performance across multiple channels of interaction. In this demanding environment, it is difficult, but imperative, for call center supervisors to learn best practices and to acquire the skills and techniques that enable them to achieve and even exceed their goals."
good,"Terrific benefits (free cable) but laid off were constant during my time there. A lot of good people, including myself were victims of it. Stressful on a daily basis"
good,"Great place to work! Handling customer accounts, by assisting with billing inquires and more. Repackaging customers into a more economical package that our customer could afford. Giving great customer service!"
good,Great job although you have to have a thick skin. Problem was inconsistency which makes your job hard to do. Job itself was great managerial not so great. Hard company to move up the latter in.
good,"Comcast encourages its employees to have a strong work life balance, providing work from home, flexible work hours and generous paid time off to make this happen"
good,"Change is a constant at Comcast, which makes for new and unique challenges around every corner. Comcast is a very diverse work environment, and everyone's ideas are encouraged."
good,It was okay not really for me some mangers are good some need more training. other than that the hours are good just long and stressful a lot of the time.
good,This is a good company to work for. just like any other company out there its has its good and bad things. I believe that  over all a good company to work for.
good,National cable/ telephone company.  not a very good compensation plan was in place for sales force.  Customer service was not a favorite for the costumers that would call in with issues with their service or billing.
good,"i don't want to write this. There is no skip option, this gets me past the minimum so that I do not have to write more. This isn't a very good summary."
good,"Very business like, professional attitude. Management is very judgmental and non professional. Manager has little formal education, no college at all."
good,I would take phone calls from customer having problems with their cable service. I would diagnose the problem and either fix it over the phone or dispatch a truck for an on siteservice repair.
good,"Great job but hard to advance or get promoted because of politics in the office. "
good,"This was my second contract for Comcast. I love working for them, although as a consultant my experience may've been a bit different than that of employees."
good,alot of work not enough pay driving all day crazy customers too far dispatch routes us all over the place jobs get put on you and then taken off you with no notice
good,This is a good place to work due to competitive pay and great benefits. I found that there were communication problems within the company as far as we were told one thing but others seemed to be telling our customers something different. All in all it is a fast paced sometimes stressful job but the friendly team players seemed to make a big difference in my happiness.
good,Ive worked at Comcast for some years with every 5 years I was going for advancement now I'm in a position  where I'm at a stand still.  I love working with  Accounting &  Finance but the position I'm currently in its changing more to customer service and the jobs are being outsourced to different parts of the country.
good,Comcast is a great company to work for and is willing to invest in its employee by offering to assist and or pay further education. My favorite part was learning to work the new products .
good,"Good overall company however, the stress levels are extremely higher than other organizations I have worked for. Sales are expected to deliver on goals and budgets, but the support groups are not aligned with the sales team goals."
good,"This is a great place to work. very innovative.  A typical day at work includes learning about  new products, improving the customer experience and employee satisfaction."
good,"As a Communication Technician with Comcast i learned how to climb ladders, attach to poles and cable wires, drop RG-6 and RG-11 cables and connect them to folks houses in the neighborhood to enable their WiFi, Cable; phone systems."
good,"great benefits, staff, product and overall experience with comcast. The company took care of its employees and i had good relationships with management teams."
good,"The dispatch position was fun and fast paced. Helped me increase my ability for working with all areas of cable industry from customers to cable techs. Also, much is involved in a dispatch position co-workers and management were easy to work with and offered assistance if needed."
good,"work is straight forward and easy to pick up."
good,Everyday is challenging with new task. Gained skills in less span of time and the work place is very interactive.Most enjoyable part of job is traveling to new places and meeting new people.
good,"Good place to work, very fast placed, plenty of overtime including weekends and some holidays, Good supervisors,very strong family culture,good pay, monthly profit sharing"
good,"I like to work for comcast ,and is one of my best job that i ever had , the employees are friendly and caring to help each other. I liked this job one"
good,"Very Good Environment & Excellent Job Only DownFall Is Pay. Plenty Hours And Less Pay! Management Was Very Well in Handling Situations. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job, IS The Happiness On The Customers Face After Resolving Issue Or Installation."
good,"Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education."
good,Management sits too far up in the Ivory Tower to know what is going on.  Senior Leadership is reactive when making polices.  They treat their sales reps like kids versus professional men and women.
good,"Environment is friendly and if anyone is planning to start the career, then this is the right place to start with. I have learnt a lot in this company"
good,"Pros - Great on-boarding and training for entry-level employees."
good,family orientated place. fast pase and lots of good people.Never a dull moment. working with prople with duch diversity a major plus. lots of hard working people who care about the customers
good,a typical day at work can be stress filled with being forced to deal customer abuse and take call after call with no breather in between unless its slow....pay is nice benefits are awesome upper management is nice and there are some perks but the customers will drive you crazy and the process is terrible and the goals are sometimes ridiculous not mention the 3-12 shift you are forced work until the next shift bid is draining and life damaging
good,"Must be willing to walk long hours daily. Must be self motivated, must be willing to work long hours or event to meet your weekly quota. If you don't meet your quota, then you will not have a pay check."
good,The environment was very appropriate for sales. I had a quota to meet and that was easy to do.  The company offered incentives  to work extra hours. I worked 4 hours a day five days a week and often worked on weekends for extra hours and sales bonus pay. I enjoyed working for such a great company.
good,Good company with great benefits and lots of lateral and upward mobility.  Sales environment is to throw mud against the wall and see what sticks. Pay could be much better.
good,"Money was great. benefits was nice. everything else not so good. I was under a quota system so you had to produce or get fired. stressful @ times but compensation was great @ the time. now that they got rid of the door to door program. the money's not there anymore , since most sales are happening within stores now like walmart and BJ's infinity stores and of course via call center."
good,"Comcast has an amazing work culture, great work life balance, career advancement options and great great benefits. The hardest part of the job is leadership. Other than that, awesome place to work!"
good,"The management to whom I reported was supportive and amenable. The call center was mostly well attended. The call center shut down and though I was offered an opportunity to relocate the especially since I didn't own a car at the time, the new commute wasn't worth the pa,  despite my being promoted to trainer earlier that year."
good,Working in a retail environment meant pursuing leads and building rapport with consumers. Comcast provided brochures and literature to provide the customers.
good,"They have a pretty good training class, pay could be better. They give you all the tools you need to be successful at the job.  benefits are ok.  Could emphasize safety more as a company.not easy to move up the ladder."
good,"Typical workplace, with a very fast paced atmosphere. Depending on the manager that you receieve this can be a great place to work for. The manager that you work under can encourage you to be the best person that you can be. Always pushing you to go to the level of promotion."
good,management gives you the tools you need to do your job. very competitive salary and great potential to make a lot of money and grow within. great leadership.
good,"Nice place to work. good colleagues and projects. Flexible timings."
good,Overall a good company to work for still have friends there now.  Free cable and internet.  Just pay the box fee.  Compensated for time with overtime from time to time.  It was relaxed and then started to take calls from all over the country and got stressed by that a little overall good for the money.
good,Analysis and development of the business critical requirements. Bug analysis and fixes to be completed in a very limited time frame and to be pushed to production.
good,As part of the technical operations team we took care of the service and installation of Xfinity products in customers' homes.  We took pride in providing excellent customer service even if they had issues with the sales team or the customer service reps on the phone.  The best part of my job was providing great products and making customers happy.  The most difficult part was acting like Comcast actually cared about it's employees when the real force behind any decision was the bottom line ($$$).
good,"Not a bad place to work.  It is a constantly changing environment.  It has to keep current with trends and technology to stay in business, so things are constantly changing.  That can make it fun because it doesn't get boring, but it can also be very frustrating because as soon as you get used to something, it changes."
good,"Fast paced, on your feet work. Keeps you busy and help the day move smoothly. People were great and trainers were very knowledgeable. Overall good experience."
good,"A typical day at Comcast consists of speaking to and resolving customers concerns. I learned skills such as problem solving, being self sufficient. The hardest part of the job is having to maintain calmness when dealing with difficult customers and quality is based on how well you read through a paper instead of being nice to customers"
good,Pay at comcast is very competitive. The work is long hours and can be very stressful. Overall it is a good company to work for if you can handle the workload.
good,The company is currently undergoing a difficult transition in an attempt to correct its significant customer service woes. This period of change has led to employment status concerns and a period of uncertainty within the our team of skilled and effective technical support specialists. The team has always provided excellent customer service oftentimes in spite of  the remainder of the company. Unfortunately this history of high quality service has been ignored by the senior leadership and our team is facing elimination.
good,"I was not able to improve my pay rate or title in the time I was there although you are told throughout training that after you start working and are meeting you metrics you are able to post out for promotions or transfers after 6 months. I posted over 100 positions and only had 3 interviews. I didn't see anyone on my team, or my floor get promoted in the time I was there."
good,"Friendly people. Quite a few benefits. The logistics system is skewed, not in employee favor. Anything that happens out of your control works against you, which is stressful."
good,I loved the work that I did. I was upset when the company decided to restructure and relocate my position. I would have liked the compensation to be a little higher for the amount of work that I did.
good,"Comcast is a fun environment and is very people driven. They create a fun work environment with pool tables, portable basketball hoops and ping pong tables available for break times. The company is very involved with the community and gives back a great deal during Comcast Cares day and has great low income programs for households with children in school. "
good,The hardest part about the job is that compensation is not like is used to be. It is also difficult to balance work and family life. Customer service needs to improve so that customers are retained.
good,Really enjyed working for Comcast..why because it really cut down one of my biggest bill i have i my home. also enjoyed reaching personal and team goals.
good,Hmmm working for comcast was great. Get to meet allot of new people from different walks of life. Using skill consistently is a great way to keep it fresh.
good,"Sold B2B enterprise class software/service licenses for digital content management and publishing systems.  Led cross-functional teams through opportunity evaluation, process/business term definition, and contract negotiations.  Negotiated content/ distribution deals, sales agreements, support levels, implementation timelines, and customized solutions. Led responses to RFI and RFP initiatives."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Comcast, the work environment was great, and there was great communication with my supervisors. They make sure you are trained and have all the help you need to succeed."
good,"The days go by quick due to it being constantly busy, however you get paid on commission as well as hourly which can lead to very nice pay checks. In totality it was a nice place to work with great co-workers."
good,"It was a good place to work. Stressful because of the customers but co-workers were awesome. I learned a lot technically and definitely became more patient. Overall, a great company to work for and I would recommend them to my friends and family. The benefits were great."
good,Great place to work but since the Florida Region Office oversees the Fort Myers office I felt more as a line on a spreadsheet than an employee as it was years past
good,"The people I interacted with were amazing, always willing to answer any questions I had. Definitely would come back and implement my knowledge I gained."
good,"Good job with a busy day and a lot of driving is included.  Great benefits and opportunities for advancement.  But if trying to reach management level, its tough.  Company is too big to run smoothly as per my experience with management.  Hardest part is probably climbing the pole, and the most enjoyable part is meeting the clients."
good,Was able to grow as a sales professional so much here. The people are professional and the product was top notch. Lead the commercial sales industry for north east Ohio.
good,The job is fun and days go by quick. Risky profession if not careful. superviors are great as well as their manager. the pay is a main concern that its not enough
good,quick paced and competitive with a very diverse culture.  everyone is always looking out for each other.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with other reps who had previously lied to a customer to try and give them a better deal.
good,"Great well known company. Management can change here and there, but the service is an easy sale due to the company's advertisement. Location is fairly new."
good,"It's great, if you don't mind knocking on someones door at 830-9 pm. Compensation plan was great, hrs were Decent and the benefits were solid. Just certain portions weren't the most ideal"
good,"Comcast was a great place to work.  The people are marvelous- and is it's greatest feature - the benefits are excellent, and the pay appropriate for the skill level required.  On the down side, despite paying lip service to ""customer service is our most important product"". Comcast insists on having every agent be a sales rep, and those in sales are required to meet quota goals that force them to manipulate customers into buying services they don't need.  That and an embarrassingly frustrating IVR are not conducive to a positive customer experience.  Specifically, sales reps are required to sell all four lines of business on every call, even though most customers have little to no interest in home phone or home security."
good,"Typical day: Makegoods, order revisions, copy entry, presentation-building, schedule-building, invoice resolutions, administrative tasks, ordering supplies."
good,meet former customer and give them new incentives to give the company another chance. Show them all the new features on our company ipad and try to beat to quality of service they experience with current cable company.
good,Company gives lots of insights on life. Helps growth throughout company. Everyone is a team player no matter what store that they were in. If you needed help with anything any no one knew the answer. Someone was bound to go find it
good,"Great company. Excellent benefit package for employees, lots of contests and events for employees. Management not very professional and not skillful in how to handle employees."
good,Comcast was a great company to work for. It was a very family orientated company. There were a lot of growing pains as they acquired more company's but always a great place to work.
good,Customer Service had it's challenging days. There is a lot of information changing day to day. PATIENCE and a PEOPLE person for this job. Great benefits and incentives. Management was great but it is a Corporate company so job security is not guaranteed since Human Resources has a poor way of dealing with employees.
good,"Worked as a graduate student researcher over the summer at the Comcast center in Philidelphia, PA.  Aided in the security examination of a series of systems and well as help developed a potential application for the X1 system."
good,"The culture is nice and the people are great. Not much in the way of career progression, though. Benefits and compensation could be better. Lots of resources at your disposal to perform your job."
good,"Good company but location was less than desirable for me due to commuting by train into the city. Other than that great place to work."
good,A friendly environment for work with a multitude of users to support. Working in several remote locating gives a lot of responsibilities for supporting the infrastructure and users and sometimes the facilities. Work days go by very quickly and extends sometime into the late night.
good,"You get to be independent and have a good team environment at the same time. You aren't micro managed and you learn a lot about advertising in regards to billing platforms, regions, and networks."
good,"Took inbound calls daily from customer with Cable services or wanting the services. Processed payments, added services, removed services, technical support"
good,"Paid training, great benefits. Excellent place to work as long as you have a flexible work schedule. Great management, and a fun job."
good,Management focused on growth. Product quality primary focus. Customer service an area that has become a growing necessity to stay the industry leader in home entertainment and communication
good,"Comcast is an enormous company.  Their are too many people making decisions who are too distant from the opportunities and issues.  "
good,I contracted with Comcast in 2015. The training is awesome and great company and career. Great Management Team.  Improvement on business etiquette need improvement. Otherwise awesome company.
good,"I loved this job and saw myself working there for a very long time, the only reason I left was because I was not able to get full time.  The team building activities and meetings are really fun too."
good,Management will go through whatever they have to help you succeed.  The work can get strenuous but is never too much for one person to handle with the flexible routing and scheduling.
good,"With all of the accounts we had to vet, we still seemed to have it pretty easy and had a very great team to work with. Too bad it was disbanded. They outsourced all of our duties to another state. It is funny because we had to teach them all how to do our jobs."
good,Worked Overnight shift for 2 months before being promoted to Overnight Manager. Worked with a dedicated grill team and later in my time got front line assistance as well. Also went to and graduated Basic Shift Management and Advanced Shift Management course as DTC in Denver.
good,"I have just started with Comcast and feel that in 2017 one should not have to cold call on both known and new customers, Other than that, the benefits are great as well as help out in the field when needed."
good,"Fun first job, easy to advance as long as you work hard. Have fun and work hard. Pay is ok for a high school student. Pay would not suffice at entry level for someone with a family or major bills."
good,"A very good company to work for. Very challenging technologically wise, and very enjoyable the fact that management allow you to learn while you are on the job. I learned a lot of new skills that were transferable to the new company that I have been working for now."
good,"At first you don't receive all employee benefits, the training was fun and nesting team was very supportive. The One thing I really disliked was that there was not enough support from floor managers when there was a very difficult call. Otherwise from management if you do well in terms of collections you collect very nice bonus pay and coworkers are very friendly and helpful."
good,I was an intern at Comcast. The typical day consisted of a location shoot. There was an occasional in studio shoot. There were also days when I was in the office doing clerical work. I learned the basics of production and how to work within a production crew. My co-workers were a great team to work with. The hardest part of the job were the boring office days. The most enjoyable part of the job were the variety of  assignments and productions.
good,I have advanced with many given opportunities and classes available through the company. My yearly reviews and subsequent raises have always made me feel appreciated here.
good,"The benefits are great, sadly the commission structure changes quarterly and NEVER in the benefit of the customer care agent I used to make 50k plus a year when I left the commissions changed so much I ended with 39k"
good,took care of all customers questions and tech issues. emplyees have to up sale every customer and be off phone in 5-7 min. First call resolution
good,"Great place to work, awesome benefits, not great for advancement or salary though. The courtesy services are fantastic. I havn't paid for cable in 10 years"
good,Fast paced customer focused company. knowledgeable management that cares about their employees. Team oriented environment. can be a bit long winded with hours but that's what you sign up for. Get to meet new people everyday
good,"This is a wonderful thing to help with expanding my career. I can handle jobs by myself in an effiecent timing. Going under houses, crawl spaces, i conducted making new outlets. With comcast climbed poles daily running aerials from pole to house. Customer sastifaction is the key to work force. Being the face of comcast, my customer services had to be adequate. This is the job for me."
good,Large company that is very professional.  Good benefits. Opportunity for furthering education within company for advancement. great benefits for the employees
good,It has great benefits. It is a good company to work for. Since it is a big company. work work environment is based on the team you work on.

good,"I started as a CAE in the call center located in York, Pa....and then furthered my career as a workplace safety specialist to use my training from my military career.  I will provide an honest review of my experience to any potential employer even if that would be this company.  I have valid reasons for this response."
good,"Great Co-workers at work place, who a ready to help out when needed. Great work-life balance. Excellent work culture and management team."
good,you have to put in the effort to get paid. Contractor technician but pay is ok. Management is easy to locate in case of issue. Will have to use your own vehicle
good,Stressful environment and highly technical work using various proprietary tools.  Limited training was afforded and analysts were left to learn many of the tools on their own.  Comcast provided good benefits and rewards for it's employees.

good,The job was very stressful and a lot of pressure to make sales and numbers by supervisors and management and very competitive (Cut Troat) co-workers.  I don't recommend anyone to work there as a Direct Sales Rep unless you really need it or you are ready to  encounter a hostile place of employment.

good,Comcast is a very fun and encouraging environment to work in. Management is very helpful and truly cares about their employees. I work in Client Services and get to resolve issues before they become big issues. We fix sales agent's work order from start to installation so the customer has a seamless transaction and the sales agent gets their commission. The pay in my department in on the lower end of the market and could be better.
good,"This was a fun place to work where I could go see concerts I wanted to go to, but get paid to work them. I would usually only work with one or two employees at a time, and we would check tickets so people didn't go into the wrong sections.

Once that is done, I am to implement a strategic plan to produce maximum sales from the night before."

I like knowing what needed to be done, where it had to be done and when I had to be there to do it. Comcast made sure that I had my scheduled appointments at least a day in advance. They had excellent management, but I never really got a chance to get to know much of my co-workers since I had to spend most of my time on the road and away from the office. The hardest part of my job was configuring a customers (outdated) personal computers to work with the equipment."

good,"Working with Comcast was although short, but  a learning experience.  A typical day would consist of interacting with service men to make sure they had the right  location in order to be ontime and also documenting information to relay to them the problem the customer had at the time.  The co-workers were genially willing to help me with any information I lacked until I caught on.  The hardest part of the job was remembering all information and not get flustered, but the most enjoyable  part of the job was staying busy."
good,"My typical day at work starts off with me getting my sales brochures and pricing information readily available at my desk. This way, I am prepare myself to sell effectively to potential customers. I then record the transactions from the previous day to our accounts receivable database.

We usually brainstorm to come up with different ways to offer our services while overcoming objections. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers who were not fully informed about their services and what it included as well as the pricing scale.

good,Comcast has great benefits to offer but the work life balance is horrible.  They want more out of their salaried employees than you can ever imagine.  Unrealistic goals that are not ramped up but set very high right from the first day you start.  Training is sub par and could be better.  In order to move up in the company its about who you know not how talented you are.
good,Comcast i a good company and takes care of their employees benefits wise. The work schedule for technicians isn't bad but you definitely have to have thick skin.
good,"Comcast is very rewarding. With the countless benefits they offer and employee feedback, they provide a level of collaboration from customer to agent to management. They care about the quality of how you feel working with the company and things that you may want to see change."
good,A company always seeking for innovation to provide a variety of service products and users friendly to customers. Challenges all employees to develop their skills and Learn to Adapt to changes.
good,"Overall the workplace environment is great, however the role I was playing isn't the role that I was willing to settle for.  The worksite I was placed didn't put enough value in the job performance."
good,"Awesome place to work if you can get in to the right department. As a technician it is a great place to work. Management is great, customers are great.. Benefits are absolutely amazing."
good,"Company culture, structure, and management styles are in constant change in an effort to make the company more competitive with online media. The environment is fast-paced and sometimes contradictory, demanding that employees be comfortable with conflict and ambiguity. Comcast Spotlight's (now Effectv) media offerings are impressive and deliver high value to customers."
good,"I work in the supply chain for comcast. Management is great and the poeple are great, but I wish they paid the supply chain more. We are the lowest paid and our annual pay raises dont reflect cost of living. One of my biggest gripes about the company."
good,"Comcast Spotlight was an energetic experience.  There are so many motivated people at all levels.  I loved my team in Illinois.  Restructures happen too often so people are a little afraid of change.  There were so many talented leaders, which is great, but leads to too many initiatives and not enough time for focus on sales activity.  Even though my position was eliminated in March, I'd still recommend the company and the tv advertising sales industry.  I wish them the very best."
good,"Busy fast pace work day."
good,"Being a company robot, unappreciated and overworked with to many things you're supposed to do at each job without having enough time to do it. But great benefits for putting up with the corporate beast."
good,"The Business environment is a normal one with job assigned , reporting to supervisor and taking instruction from supervisor. Working in a team to achieving the daily set task."
good,"Long hours, good benefits, on call required, company made you work overtime, get the job done no matter what. Very little family time if on call is required."
good,Comcast is a great company. I just don't like that I can't earn any commission anymore. Overall I've had a pretty good experience working for Comcast.
good,Great place to work with awesome people.  Lots of flexibility and opportunities for motivated professionals.  Business is focused on individuals with a learning and coaching environment.
good,I really would not like to comment because I don't have the time or strength to give you the background on my experience with this company. Therefore please respect my position.
good,"My 3 years there were extremely stressful however I would go back.  The work life balance does suck, so maybe not so great for people with families but when disaster strikes, the company will help their employees out."
good,"The work on a daily basis is demanding, but with the right boss everything is balanced. The PTO, 401k, and other benefits are great, however the pay structure from internal promotions is poor. When they hire internal the person will be paid lower than an external higher."
good,It’s was good job and fun environment. Meeting new people. Installing service calling customer ahead. Fun learning  experience. Someday were challenging other day was not bad.
good,"I left after almost 2 years at comcast, at the highest level a residential technician could achieve, and my hourly wage was 15.40 dollars an hour. Overall the work was rewarding but the compensation was not equivalent."
good,"Great company to work for, but management varies depending on your location. Able to transfer to different locations within the company. Work place culture is also dependent on the area you live in."
good,"Meetings and forecast conversation. lots of meeting with leaders and constant accountability to make sure salesforce is doing what needs to be done, and appropriately."
good,"Loved helping customers and troubleshooting issues. Great benefits and perks."
good,Great company but managers weren't always the best and I feel needs to be a real extensive selection in picking them. They offer great benefits and opportunity for growth.
good,Here is a great place to work very face passed. Have to he on top of all the changes going on. Ready to make changes and move the changes along to the customer.
good,Great company and products and are the industry's best. Essential to have a successful career at Comcast are having solids skills and the ability to adapt.
good,Very poor upper level management that is more worried about PC culture than doing the right thing and stepping up for their employees  They are too worried about the public image and not how their employees feel
good,Good paying job where you can advance to good positions whenever somebody dies or retires. Nobody ever leaves the good positions. We are always understaffed because we cant keep the people dued to either competition or they weren't good enough. There is always OT so that's a plus and the benefits are great. The people here are great to work with. And my job is pretty easy. Easiest job I ever had I believe.
good,"The upper management that are corporate tend to lie and it is easy to tell. I do not respect liars. the local management are great, they are very hands on and willing to help you. the place is good if you do not mind being beat up by angry customers on a daily basis and are okay with trying to sell people new products while you cannot help them fix their current problem. you do get a really good discount on the services and they do offer good benefits."
good,"Diverse fast-paced work environment, with the typical office drama, lower than average salaries paired with great benefits and plenty of site locations."
good,"They spend a lot of time trying to evolve when comes to technology only to drop that technology and the customers suffer especially the Sr customers, It can be a good place to work but metrics tend to bring out the stress in agents"
good,They need more floor supervisor to help the new employees that way they become better sale's person. That's for people that like telemarketing it was a new experience but I won't do it again. I appreciated the opportunity you guys gave me.
good,"Who you work with and for is excellent. You feel supported. The promotion system is ridiculous and somewhat unrealistic. The metrics they require are difficult to obtain. I’ve been working there for a little over a year, working very hard toward a promotion, and haven’t gotten one or a pay increase. I was told that promotions and raises come quickly. I have yet to see that for myself or my coworkers. Comcast tries to justify it by saying that the benefits and courtesy services makes it so it evens out as far as pay goes against competitors. Not accurate at all. I did the math."
good,"Good job point system for the day is unethical, its like a quota that cops get. your alone with a stranger at their home which makes me feel unsafe since its Florida"
good,"Comcast can be great in some respects and poor on others. Advancement is difficult as jobs open up, first choice is usually a transfer from the same title in a different FMA.  It's difficult to compete against people that already have the same title and experience, as well as the share number of applicants.  Comcast can also be very clicky, they follow the open opportunity protocol but usually interviews are for show and someone has already been selected for any given position regardless of qualification comparisons."
good,"With almost free service and access to many benefits, its a great company to work for. Almost always there are great programs available and many different networking options for individuals."
good,"It was overall a good compay to work for. There is a few things I would have changed, but I really enjoyed some of the people I worked with. If they had kept the virtual program (working from home) I would still be with Comcast."
good,"When I joined up it was great - lots of very interesting people working on fun, innovative projects with loads of passion. As time went on it seemed that the main office was shutting down or shelving a lot of the ""riskier"" innovations people were hacking on. Seemed odd to have your Innovation Center get its funding cut for research and development."
good,Fast paced environment to help customers calling in for services and products and also installations of Comcast services also to help customers with their problems
good,Comcast does a great job at providing good wages and competitive benefits.  They have a wide variety of employee perks for discounted services.  they now have global opportunities.
good,Not applicable. It was life learning experience .. metrics were never fully together & the pressure was anonymous but over all learned great sales ethics
good,"Call center sales position.  Goals and commission structures continually change.  Good pay if you can maintain monthly scorecards.  Continuous changing of packages, offers and constant learning."
good,"Make sure arrive on time and ready to work, and be flexible on shifts. Take calls from multiple customers a day, having to troubleshoot connection issues with tv,hsd,home phone and still upgrade or sell products to customer"
good,"Been there for 13 years, it's a respectable place of work. The workplace culture is fast paced but everyone is collaborative, which makes the tasks doable."
good,"Had work from home a few days a week but was taken away.  Org's are always changing. Uneasy feeling based on the changes. Not a ton of growth opportunity. However, the leadership is flexible and understanding. This has made the 10 years here great.  I also have a great team that works hard and I have been given the flexibility to manage the way I'd like. It has been great to be a part of a business that went from a handful of customers to hundreds of thousands."
good,"Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now... I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen, I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth, but it's up to you to make it happen. Not only this - it's pretty exciting. We're busy and we have big jobs to do. My salary is in the top percentile for my industry but not only this, I again get the continued education (which is ~$6K/year) plus free cable/internet, top health care benefits and a truly balanced lifestyle - which is rarely the case within the Tech industry."
good,great company with great culture and bounces. Benefit starts day 1 including healthy and while package with free internet service and cable and discounted other services. Culture is great and mostly depends on which department since it’s a big company in Colorado area. For me personally retail isn’t listed in my long term plan anymore.
good,"Unlike my internship at the Philadelphia headquarters location, the West Chester office was a little more laid back and casual. I was a member on a team of about 10. Given that I was only on a 3-month contract I didn't get as good of a feel for the place as I would have liked, but I enjoyed my time there."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking payments/ up selling customers on current products, and setting up new customers for new lines of business. I learned how to deal with push back when offering services. As far. as management goes, there was slight favoritism shown at times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with childish drama going on in the office. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to demonstrate products and services to the customer."
good,"As with all companies, certain departments are better to work for than others."
good,"Great place to work with  many changes on a weekly basis for the purpose to make services and convenience to customers."
good,"My typical day began with setting up the company systems to answer customers' emails. I learned about a new industry, which was fun, however the hardest part of the job was not receiving additional training related to my job when requested. The best part of the of the job was the relaxed work environment."
good,"Good 6 week training program, fun atmosphere.  Culture is all right, people are friendly, perks are very good.  Gym and Café in house.  Management is inconsistent - your experience will depend heavily on who you have a as a supervisor."
good,"The work place culture is diverse, and people are very nice for the most part. They offer differ incentives and they recognized employee who perform well"
good,"stressful"
good,"The Job is easy but stressful at times, Supervisors don't care about technicians. All they care about is the darn numbers and there bonuses. Looking for a raise is like digging for gold. You work hard and your not appreciated"
good,"8hr work schedule, days when overtime is offered.  Lots of fun training. The loved working for Comcast like family environment folks are always willing to support you on the job."
good,"Everyday at Comcast is different, but challenging. There are multiple inspections and field observations to be completed each month on each technician. Each day supervisors are also tasked with going to specific calls, referred to as Chronics (3-5 per day), with his technicians. We also have to complete 3 Quality Control inspections on each technician per month. There are also daily, weekly, and monthly conference calls and meetings with upper management. Additional administrative duties include quarterly assessments, mid-year and final performance reviews and any disciplinary action."
good,"I loved  my job in Danville, IL but they closed the office. No other positions to go too.  Comcast now is totally different than what it was when I worked there. No set schedule, average pay, Hours are now early am to lat pm.   Store/sales instead of customer serivce on accounts"
good,"Comcast taught me the value of a good days work.  The job was stressful but very fulfilling.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with various personalities, not direct reports but co-workers.  The most enjoyable part was developing my direct reports and becoming a part of their lives"
good,"Very team oriented, lots of opportunities to advance career. Great benefits and discounts, inbound and outbound call center. Handling customers’ inquires while using negotiating skills to collect delinquent balances and retain the customer. The hardest part of the job was the angry customers, the most enjoyable part was the reward feeling for helping your customers. Management was great and really personable, it helped create a family rather than just another job."
good,"Comcast has a very positive environmnet and features a full suite of multimedia product for Sales Agents to sell, offer to Customers. Every day is dynamic and exciting."
good,"Great place to work when first starting with company. Always challenging, ever changing.  Training support was always lacking but if you know where to look you were able to find the information needed.  For being a major Telecommunications company, the communication wasn't always timely and forthcoming which hindered the ability to effectively support our customers adequately. Workplace culture was friendly. Management as a whole was effective at delegating day to day duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with but most of all being able to successfully support and assist our customers with all of the problems."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was being with the people that worked there at the time and resolving customer issue in a fast and timely matter. Although I felt restrained in my current position (because I was good at it) I felt I didn't get the career advancement I needed to become better at the time.
good,"It's a great place to work, just no job growth for me. Great people to work with. I learn a lot from running huddles and meetings. Gave me a good idea how to run my own business."
good,For the most part I enjoyed my job at COMCAST. The only reason I left was due to a relocation issue. I really liked the people I worked with and learned many new programs and was able to explain them to others.
good,"Managed a group of sales individuals promoting the Comcast products such as Telephone, cable and internet; job entailed coaching, motivating and rewarding sales excellence."
good,"company provides good benefits, paid time off and sick time, schedules depend on each department."
good,"Comcast was very fast paced.  Long hold times and call volume most days, and the shift you chose to work, followed you for a year. Fun workplace and they try to do a lot in the sense of team building."
good,"I have been with Comcast for 11 years. The benefits are competitive and nice. The stock option is great and the longer you work there the more time off you are allowed to take. The experience here is similar to most large corporations in that with the right supporters, the sky is the limit."
good,Comcast Treat the employee well. Management is relaxed and typically not as effective as it should be. They have no idea how to hire people that have been pres creened to add tot he success of the daily operations.
good,The hardest part of the job is : that there isn't a real retirement plan.  It would be nice to know that after 20 years with the company you would receive a retirement check.
good,"Fun  and diverse employees  to work with. Great benefits come with the job as far as 401k, cable, internet , phone, home security discounts. Conmmission is paid with sales positions."
good,"I loved working for Comcast. However, I didn't make any more as I did as a basic laborer in construction despite all the diverse skill sets required.  Similar position for competing companies start higher and advance faster."
good,Some days can be intense with work and meetings and other days can be half the intensity. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. My co workers definitely make hard days easier.
good,Comcast was an OK place to work and everyone was very friendly.  The downside from my point of view was a bit of unrealistic work practices.  I worked a full long day during normal business hours and a couple of hours in the evening in scheduled meetings with offshore resources.  Everything was very high paced.
good,"Cable TV advertising puts your brand front and center with the people who matter most. With dozens of demographically targeted networks and thousands of shows, we can find the right audience for your message, all day, every day. Your customers will see and remember your name during the programs they enjoy most. Comcast Spotlight unites the prestige of TV with cutting-edge technology, giving you a branding platform that puts your message in front of your audience efficiently"
good,"great benefits. good pay. its like school. need to contact a third party just to go to restroom if youre gone for 2-3 minutes. doesn't recognize creditability, more negative than positive feedback"
good,Great company but poor salary you work really hard for your money. Very less or no increment. Poor quality of resource management. Poor process of skill development. No transparency. Client is given highest priority on cost of employee happiness and satisfaction
good,I enjoyed my Time with this company.  I had three separate roles in my time with Comcast and was able to grow.  This only stopped when i was held back by a particular manager who had his own ambitions and ideas.
good,"Incredibly huge corporation where technology and protocol do not change yearly it sometimes changes hourly. An incredibly well run profitable company that is very profitable.The company does not listen to its employees in the field but by accountants and management that some days turn the company in a direction that makes no sense but it rolls on and it adjusts.The technology is cutting edge and you better be on top of ones game as it will change.Beautiful facilities.I was fortunate to start there when the company was called AT&T Broadband and it was taken over by Comcast who then bought out Time Warner in Minnesota so I was definitely in the right place at the right time .For some reason I was consistently not only a Top Performer but the Team that I was on was the consistently the top team in the Midwest Division which covered 5 states in metrics,sales,customer service and technical support.Kind of the Tri Fecta Comcast and so many companies strive for .It was alot of fun and I had and made alot of friends"
good,"Great benefits, very flexible. Managers have always been great, but opportunities to grow meant more travel or even re-locating. "
good,The management was only trained for managing employees not so much for actual accounts and how to use the system so if you need help you are kind of on your own if you can not find another employee to help. Management is quite friendly besides lack of education which has nothing to do with them personally but everything to do with comcast for not allowing them to be trained properly. overall the pay was decent benefits as well you work mandatory 40 hours a week and often have overtime
good,"very competitive in the door to door environment, many people not willing to change services or just don't want to be bothered with you coming to the hous e unannoounced"
good,"I spent 8 hours on the phone recruiting sales reps and setting up personal interview."
good,"I worked for Comcast for a number of years, then our department was sold to a Contractor.  It was a good experience overall. The environment is typically fast-paced and never boring."
good,"A typical day at work was answering inbound calls and making outbound calls. I learned how to calm down angry customers, because most customers were angry and i also learned how to work with metrics and meet goals. The management was okay. The managers really didn't like to help workers. A lot of customers called in because of management. It was a nice workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is learning what all the error messages mean and how to by pass them. The most enjoyable part was being able to calm the customer and overturn a negative into a positive."
good,"good company to work for . nice benefits, as well as commission program. There are opportunites to transfer and relocate if you so desire. The only setback is promotions"
good,"Comcast always had work for us to do. So I new we had job security. I enjoyed that type of work but I unfortunately had a sick member of my family to be with. I had no more leave time so I had to resign. Family always comes first, don’t get that misunderstood I am a dedicated worker and I will be a great asset to this company"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Comcast. They care about their employees, much of the bad opinions of the company are unfounded. The employees there work very hard to try and make every customer happy. "
good,A fast paced place to work. What I learned was to focus on the positive aspects on the job and learn to have fun as well. The contests were always great  incentive.
good,"For all it's bad rep for customer service, all the agents I dealt with on a daily basis were extremely dedicated. Management was accessible, all the way up to the VP"
good,Inbound and outbound sales.i learned to use a multiple phone line. Training was great at Comcast.i learned a lot about sales and how to close a deal. I worked from home as well.
good,In todays times this would be a great place if you are able to get hired full time. The issue will be location. The service center in Alpharetta  is not on a full bus line and the bus service stops while the office hours go longer. Other than that fast pace always changing place of business
good,"Must be at work at least an hour before your shift in order to get through security, wardrobe, and shuttled to you job location. Then after your shift, repeat the same process"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Comcast.  Excellent benefits.  There do seem to be a lot of opportunities for internal advancement, but you need to be in charge of your own growth and development.  Lots of options for employee resource groups to join and help with networking, cross collaboration, etc."
good,"Recommends"
good,"Things change at a moments notice, must be able to adapt and overcome challenges. If you have a good sales background and self motivated to do well, Comcast will be a good fit for you."
good,"Great salary if you're just starting, but not good if you're looking for a stress-free environment. Experience depends on your direct superior. You are lucky if you will be under a good one."
good,Comcast has many opportunities for sales and technical field work.  Many levels of advancement are open to those fields.  Bonuses are given out to all employees of different skill levels.  Vacation and PTO are very generous.   There are strict metrics to maintain and are changed regularly to meet company goals.
good,"This is a great company, but the recruiter who wanted me on board never let me know the true details of the sales position.  A lot of people like the company."
good,"I have to say I didn't work for Comcast Cable, I worked for The Results Companies. I don't know why it keeps saying that I worked for Comcast Cable. I did enjoy working for The Results Companies, it is a great place to work, very laid back environment. With plenty of room for advancement and growth within the company."
good,Traffic department was fast paced with little room for breathing.  I preferred the role of Master Control Center.  Excellent onsite team who shares information to succeed in your role.
good,"Turnover rate was pretty high, so management changed a lot, had to learn to handle a lot of my own issues or concerns, other than that I loved the job"
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for because of the benefits and discounts, and paid time off, vacation days, and sick days. However, if you are a Comm Tech there it is almost impossible to progress to a higher pay grade. The company makes it really hard for the technicians and are steadily increasing terms on which a technician can progress to a higher pay grade. I would love to stay with Comcast but not as a technician. The only reason why I am leaving the company is because they currently do not have any jobs available in my degree field, if they had I would stay with this company indefinitely."
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for. Good benefits, decent pay, but the call center environment is awful. Liberty Lake was good, but Lynnwood is terrible."
good,Fast-paced environment that is constantly changing.Good working relationships are important for growth. Office culture varies from location to location.
good,A day in the life as a Tech. Get in your van by 8am and head to your first job. greet the customer and assess the job. your day to day activities are hands off by management.
good,"Awesome job. But things get old after awhile. Good Benefits, awesome managers, but there are favorites with the company. Love paid maternity leave, hard to re-adjust when coming back. Awesome benefits, and free cable( almost free, just pay a percentage)."
good,"a typical day at comcast is typically pretty laid back, you get to work. sign into your desk and begin your day. the management was always there to help and it was very much a family environment"
good,"The culture is from within, not many outside hires and in the short time there enjoyed the environment and co workers. Company provides full services with employment."
good,"Strong visionary leadership team. Work culture, work life balance and challenges vary by team and function within the company. Good company that offers a lot of opportunity for growth for talented individuals"
good,"Overall the job, pay, and culture is good.   The workload balance adequate.  Management, can use more people management training.  The company offers great benefits."
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for that offers good benefits and discounts to its employees.  The store I worked at was a friendly, family liked atmosphere."
good,The overall company was great to work for.  My local manager was very cutthroat and he didn't care for your work/life balance.  I would recommend working for Comcast.  Just don't work for my manager.
good,"Competitive environment. Management would work hard to make sure you have every training and chance to succeed. There were plenty of bonuses, spiffs and competitions to keep the sales teams engaged. Overall fun."
good,"This job is not for the thin skinned person. You deal with irate customers all day and the company doesn't really care, just save them. But how do you save a customer when you don't have the promos to give customers? The great thing is once you master how to talk to people and get them to listen to you then you'll make a lot of money."
good,"working in different weather condition I've work well with customer service , my management  team was very nice  work culture was perfect . the hardest part of that job dealing with rude people but i made it through the day"
good,Its alot of experience on troubleshooting all the time you get alot of experience as you go and its fun because you get to know the city this job requires to focus 100% every single job.
good,"Working at this role for almost two years, I've learned that everyone learns at a different pace. Some are quick minded and other not so much. But at the end of the day, everyone needs to see eye to eye. Although the company has a high churn turn around, it's great to see those who stick around and grow."
good,Comcast is a competitive market with competitive wages. Comcast rain and develop employees. Comcast provide discounts to their employees and also provide vehicles to technicians.
good,"Good, culture is good and place is also good"
good,There are many opportunities to grow and expand your skills with all the different department. They incur gage you to strive and expand your personal self.
good,I work and come to work on time everyday that I'm scheduled! I open to taking on extra work all the time! It feels like working 40hrs or more is burning me out but not increasing bank account! I have to look for a challenge!
good,They offer excellent benefits for employees. The organization is constantly changing in an effort to improve customer relations. This leads to constant change for employees. The job is fast paced and can be extremely stressful.
good,"The facility and benefits were great, but the daily stress of handling irate customers can quickly outweigh the benefits. overall someone with a strong backbone to verbal abuse from the customers would do well."
good,Comcast Spotlight is a wonderful corporation to work for. The benefit package is amazing and the flexibility to balance work/life has always been accommodating.
good,"I was the sports director for a daily regional news show.  I was responsible for all aspects of the daily sports segment, including producing, writing and on camera performance"
good,sell new service to customers is the only thing that management wants from their csa staff  if your not selling then your not working for Comcast which is stressful way to live
good,Have worked there the last 13 years.  Amazing group of Management.  Very high pace sales floor.  Comcast is a ever changing company and have gone thru many changes throught my years there.
good,"Great Company.  I enjoyed working for ADP. Definitely employee appreciation shown.  "
good,"A typical day at work included planing your day and developing a strategy of acquire new business. Extensive prospecting and follow up."
good,Enjoyed working at this location but it was very far from my home and the winter was brutal. I was offered a job closer to home with a better compensation package.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Comcast, I learned how to communicate effectively. The most enjoyable part about my job was my co-workers . We all enjoyed what we did .  I enjoyed making our customer happy."
good,"Great benefits, vacation, sick and personal days, the health insurance was also very good and having the best cable and internet service was great, and still believe is one of the best in the industry."
good,"great company to work for. great benefits as well. Only con is billing department residential does not pay as well as other departments, particular business and job requirements and metrics don't match up to salary given.  However, there is a lot of room of growth in company. Just find the right department!"
good,Worked with a lot of smart and creative people. Great management. New product roll out was intense but overall good experience. I enjoyed the job very much.
good,"Easy and good job. Temperature is a factor! Pay was not great. If you have time to grow within the company, this is the place for you. Within 10 years, you can be in a good position within the company. Your progression is up to you."
good,My experience at Comcast was new different and fast paced I learned something everyday agendas changed everyday i got to learn the business behind Comcast
good,"Love Comcast as a company, there are some great people in the company. It has been a good starting point for me bring new to Georgia been here two years"
good,Comcast was good to me over the years. The culture was overall good although it is changing. I met a lot of good people in the company over the years who taught me alot. The strength of this company is it's workforce. They do need to change their business model as the industry is changing but management is a little slow to respond. But overall I have good memories of Comcast.
good,Pretty cool place to work.  Great for new college grads.  Learned a lot from last manager.  The salary is not competitive at all.  Upper management is hard to communicate with.
good,I've worked here for 15+ years.  If willing to relocate to the main office there a a ton of opportunities and different avenues you can take to build your skill level.
good,"Comcast merits high marks for it's benefits, compensation and bonus programs.  "
good,"Comcast is a steady place to work with good benefits.can be a very stressful place to work as all they care about these days are metrics,we have all become numbers the family atmosphere is nothing more than a memory."
good,typical day when I get to work make sure there is no escalated issue and if there is get it resolve as soon as possible help with billing question do training when necessary open and great environment to work hardest part when we have outage knowing customer will be out of service for hours or days enjoyable when you able to resolve customer problem
good,"Great job but once you reach top no advancement pays well but management is poor no communication to what's going on, excellent benefits overtime available"
good,training for x1 is fun but you require more than a month of training which they do not give you. allot of benefits with healthcare and travel benefits with various of discounts
good,"Working in manangement can be difficult as the road is not a clear path to progression. Flexibility in working helps the worklife balance."
good,"Well a typical day in my experience is to answer calls and attend to customer concern, from this I've learn about different cultures, issues, characters and most important of all offering assistance using devices and programs at my disposal. Management is quite fair, except for a few scrupulous regular employees. Workplace culture is somewhat opposite to what the company actually aims, the company need to interview personally the disposed employees. "
good,I have no comment.  I think it's a personal question and individual opinion.  My views of the company may not be someone else.  You have to work for the company and make your personal opinion
good,"Overall this job has great perks, floating holidays, flex time and green time. They treat their employees excellent when it comes down to the holidays. If you have to work a Holiday, its double time and a half and they cater food to the job. Green time was awesome as well. Only thing that i did not like if the customers were rude/racist, we cannot hang up on them properly. We had to take the insults and remarks."
good,The  company has great benefits. Work was or the phone in sales. Taking up to 40 calls a day. Very fast paced environment that keeps you on your toes. Manager come and go.
good,Nice company to work for. I am in a small market and there is no room for advancement.  i am willing to relocate but the company does not offer this to often.
good,"Working at Comcast has taught me alot such as multi-tasking, working through multiple systems at once, also being able to create a relationship with the customers to be able to better assist them. Working there was fun they definitely made it fun to work there with all my co workers."
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. They helped me grow and expanded my capabilities. Comcast has created a great culture with its employees. I will miss my job here.
good,"My experience at Eastern was working for collections call center for Comcast, besides the horrible staff and management the job was overall good"
good,"Lots of different things to learn. Learned to install cable t.v, internet and phone. There were many great people to work with here. I felt like I needed a change after a while"
good,"Customer interaction, co workers great team work."
good,a really good place to work. they give you everythin you need your by yourself in a van...noboss trying to micromanage you. you get an ipad and iphone.and you get to meet and make happy new people everyday.
good,This company is a great company to work for! I loved everything that   Comcast stood for in theory. The company's credo was spot on but employee engagement was lacking.
good,"Work days are redundant and it is difficult to move up, management positions are few and spread out geographically."
good,"It was a fair and enjoyable experience for the most part, local management was the only let down.  Direct Supervisor was great but the individual in control of our tech ops division was a difficult at most moments.  Otherwise, it was a great company to work for."
good,"It was very nice to work with at&t and comcast. Got to learn many new opportunities. Friendly environment and a nice team to work with. "
good,"Con: Politics"
good,"It is an interesting, occasionally fun, and seemingly well managed company.  There are many good people there.  I would be very happy to work there again and have re-applied recently."
good,NIce to work here. You get to learn many things as most of them are started from scratch. Developed an automation frame work for the project which in turn needs you to have time to learn about the flow of the project.
good,"Accepting incoming calls from customers who wanted to set up new services, helping customers troubleshoot cable and internet issues and providing knowledge of products"
good,"Great Commission"
good,It was a call center job like any other mad customers everyone has better things to do than wait for a tech or pay their bills. job could be fun on some days like most places to people at your level aren't bad some of the supervisors were cool and knowledgeable  I cant say i experience any type of culture here besides the let me make these sales so i can get my money and not eventually be fired culture.
good,fast paced sales environment with few reward but Great for someone looking to get their feet wet in a sales. Upward mobility is very difficult but not impossible and customer base is not always friendly based on this industry
good,Hard to make your numbers aleays changing the way business is run pushing reps to cold call instead of networking which is better use ot time
good,The company was very next to work at.Then the manager and the employee was able to get along.I work and and temp to hired but unfortunately the contract ended before getting hired premit
good,"A typical day at work is at least a 10 hour day mon-sat. On call for Sundays and evenings. The most enjoyable part of the job as a manager is developing  employees and solving customer issues. I have learned so much in my 15 years mostly  on the administrative side, creating new processes. Co workers have been the best we worked very closely and always encouraged each  other. New management was brought in and our department changed very drastically to a pure sales environment which caused a lot of turnover due to the fact that team was hired mostly for customer service and could not really grasp the sales environment."
good,"Good close up management, but marketing metric shifts are less than good.  Is prone to building up stress.  Not good for a long term position."
good,Good co workers and it's fun place to work  technically we can advance  more and balanced lifestyle which is rare in tech industry
good,"Very good, but continuous change makes for an unstable work environment. If you are not accustomed to continuous change, this is not the company for you."
good,Was a technician for almost ten years with them.  Good benefits for a company.  I worked with a good team there we tried hard to give the best customer service that we could.
good,"Overall the company is not bad to work for depending on the department you are in. Most managers care about your needs, people take feedback seriously, and they really are trying to improve the customer experience, at least where I was at. Some work days you will be working long hours, and polices tend to be slow to change. The biggest problem is the company is massive, so management has no flexibility for your work needs and even about your pay. Make sure to get hired in at the wage you want as they have no power over what you make really."
good,Pleasant co-workers overtime was always being offered was allowed to swap with anyone if need to swap as long as it was approved by management nice supervisors
good,"Fun place to work with very supportive training. I liked working here for the simple fact that its Comcast and I got my cable, internet, and phone all for free while an employee. My work load was usually a combination of customer service, sales, retention and training. Office is very big so it stayed very busy all day long."
good,"Company is adequate in regards to making a living, I would noy recommend Comcast as a long term career. I would prefer a more secure established Business company."
good,"great environment, great co workers, benefits somewhat good, the camaraderie were very good..I developed my interpersonal relationship greatly, my skills level dealing with someone else issue is very high."
good,If you apply your self you can grow and learn  new skills and have more knowledge thru the companys non stop training. management support very good in helping you develop your self in to a better tech.
good,"Fun work place  to work,  Supportive management, & team leaders"
good,"Fun fast pace environment, continuous active on the job learning, knowledgeable management and team orientated. Pleasurable/personable co-workers but also very productive(work hard play hard). very little office politics if any at all. overall great experience with no complaints."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the store, greeting customers, signing people in, assisting customers with payment kiosk, organizing line, taking returned equipment into stock room, stocking new equipment. My co-workers were very team oriented and fun to work with. Management was very tough but taught us to become more independent. The hardest part of the job was handling aggressive and angry customers on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was spending time with fun and easy going co-workers."
good,"I have enjoyed the culture and friendly work environment."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Decent amount of red tape and politics, this is expected of a big company.  Job security is not so positive, this company continues to eliminate local jobs and move to other states."
good,"Constantly had to adjust to changes, ones previously discussed and ones of the unknown. Cannot ever become content, being contents throws you off track."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers, but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Professional Summary:"
good,Scheduling events with each property manager in order to present how cable can improve the apartment complex positive image to each new resident. Created new accounts from door-to-door sales. Able to coordinate sales and installation appointments for each new client. Received the Top Video Sales Performer for the month of January thru February.
good,Productive and busy work place.  Team environment with lots of change.  I am looking to do something different with my career.  I have been doing customer service/phone jobs for a while and I would like to do something other then answering the phones.  I am grateful for the job I have.  I do feel it's time to go to the next level and grow.
good,Pretty good pay and work/life balance...typical day starts out with communicating with customers and carrying out my route.  Days normally end pretty good...
good,"A typical day at a call center is to expect the unexpected. At Comcast you will develop unique sales skills through a pretty decent training program in order to retain customers and build value with the business. A lot to learn with this company as it's business model is forever changing. Management can be hit or miss sometimes, but overall not too bad. The company welcomes a very diverse culture. You will meet and make plenty of new friends\connections. The hardest part, as with any call center type job, is the stress of long hours on the phone with some not so pleasant callers\customers. But that is to be expected and there are brief occasions where the conversations can be quite entertaining which helps lighten the mood through out the day. The best part of the job of course is the satisfaction that you have achieved your goal buy assisting customers to the best of your ability."
good,Was a position that I learned a lot of information regarding Virtualization. I enjoyed the challenges that I encountered at the position.
good,"A typical day would be fast, fun, and lots of customer service because it was a call center. Co worker's were fun and easy to get along with."
good,"Company hires and lay people off depending upon some whim all the time.  I can understand that people need to change to adapt to the change in environment but this company seem to do a lot of hiring and firing all the time.  "
good,"i worked out of my bucket truck,checked my computer online for jobs and worked on them as needed,working with other team members-the hardest part of the job was working in adverse weather,the most enjoyable was fixing customer issues"
good,"This position was primarily involved in data entry of the political advertisement air time schedules. This also involved the reconciliation of pre-purchased air time support. In addition, this included the scheduling of online political ads throughout the Comcast networks."
good,"For the most part, it was a great corporate culture with great employees but the construction process is not well defined and that leads to lots of cancellations and lost commisions"
good,Train classes for 3-4 week intervals; Learned the inner-workings of Call Centers; Outsourced management is nearly impossible unless focused well on each client; Great co-workers illustrate the need to work together to overcome challenges; Finding balance amongst the different personalities at the workplace is typically a challenge for even the most experienced managers; Worker unity and team-building make the job more worth it each day
good,"A sales focused organization that has great thought leadership.  It continues to evolve as an organization.  Good work environment and atmosphere.  "
good,Comcast overall is a great company to work for and they provide great benefits for their employees. The managers that I have worked under have excellent leadership skills and strive to see their employees progress.
good,"A typical day would be answering back to back calls due to an extremely high call volume. I learned that although I'm not into sales, excellent customer service always sales products. Management was good as well. I enjoyed my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was being cursed at and having to apologize to the customer while yet being cursed. The most enjoyable part of the job were the bonuses!"
good,"Very laid back company. Supervisors are helpful and actually care about you doing well. Customers are... well, you're dealing with the general public so you know how that goes. Training is 8 weeks. They do their best to prepare you for when you get out on the call but of course the best experience is hands on."
good,"a lot of people but fun to work with"
good,"Great atmosphere"
good,"Loved working for Xfinity, worked in retail sales until program ended 4yrs later. Serverance pay accepted. Sales of cable,phone,internet and Home security. Benefits were awesome, pay was good alos."
good,Good company to work for. Promote teamwork. Management is fair and looks out for their employees. Good people to work with.
good,"I learned the recruiting portal for SAP, the system was very organized and easy to manage. The company bought CBS and the job security became low."
good,I started as a direct sales rep with Comcast but soon moved into Business Sales rep. to take advantage of my expertise from doing business to business sales while at Coca-Cola. My typical day consisted of any research on new or existing businesses to contact owner or operations personnel to match their needs with Comcast products. I had 2 good managers at first that were very supportive and then a director was brought who restructured our department and made a lot of false promises. The hardest part of the job after this was feeling comfortable with what you were being told would take place or the directions you were being given. The most enjoyable part of the job was signing the chain partners with multiple locations and being referred to other customers.
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for. Had good benefits to offer and free cable. As for the system, the management was hard to work with. You were just a number not a person no matter how hard you worked. New management came in and changed the way business was done. Many employees that have worked there for many years had hard times adjusting to their way of working and many left or lost their jobs due to this"
good,Comcast is a great company to be apart of.I have truly learned how to become a better sales consultant through their devlopment and training programs.  This is a company that you can use as a stepping stone to create a career.
good,When it comes to management it's one of those place where it boils down to who you know and that determines how far you make it within the company.
good,There was a very positive and upbeat culture at Comcast. It was a place where people tried to find a solution rather than continually gripe and not make changes.
good,answering multiple phone lines and entering the information in the system. Helping customers process payment plans
good,I would come in sit at a desk. log into the system and receive about 100 to 200 calls a day. my job was to sale the phone or internet
good,"Been working in this company for almost 6 years . for that span of time , I learned a lot especially when it comes to handling crucial type of call, importance of patience and giving out the best of your service  which  believe the reason why I worked for that long in just one company."
good,"My typical day not only consist of the management of expected client requests, but anticipating the unforeseen tasks.  I create strategic cable schedules to support my client looking to promote their business, services, or products.  "
good,met many talented people...learned many new skills...great benefits
good,"Close to home "
good,I have learnt a lot with this job it completely change me from who I used to be to who I am now.
good,Comcast is a good company but that pay but when its time to budget they will find any reason to let you go.
good,learinging different ways to deal with customers issues with their services. De-escalation of calls from upset customers. Customer satisifaction when issues are resolved.
good,Comcast brings together the best in media and technology. We drive innovation to create the world's best entertainment and online experiences.
good,at the comcast connections center a typical dat would consist of fast pace work in a retail enviroment selling comcast servises. I learned  i was able to manage a team of 8 employees so make sure they all hit goal each and every month. management was not a great part of the job but i had great co-worked that i build great relationships with  the hardest part of the job was keeping up with all are sales we had such an abundance of sales on a day to day basis but the most enjoyable part of the job was competition from my co-workers
good,"A typical working day like any other day of success."
good,"A great job, As an introduction to the call center experience, provided a great foundation for the pace and required metrics expected in a call center settings. The company offered great benefits from day one. Comcast provided opportunity to grow with in the company"
good,A typical day at Comcast began with a customers service not operating as it should. I would begin by calming and reassuring that customer that I could fix their issue. I learned how to listen and not react to negative comments. I also was held to metrics such as Average Handle Time which is quite challenging when dealing with an elderly person who does not or can not help you check connections. The hardest part of this job was being verbally abused by customers cursed at called names and being told that I was stupid and Comcast was horrible and still show empathy to that customer and not loose my temper or take the comments as a personal attack resolve the problem and move on the next customer
good,Working for Comcast has been enjoyable for most of my employment. I would recommend this company to any young person needing a good job.
good,Good company to work for I have no problem recommending to someone.
good,Overall Comcast is a good place to work.  Nice co-workers and great team players.  Unfortunately Comcast pushes sales too much which discourages customers and workers.  There are great opportunities at Comcast if you love pressure sales.
good,loaded tech trucks and stocked cabel controllers fun work environment with training available upon request good bosses but very low pay
good,"Great working environment.  Coworkers always willing to help.  Constantly trained to acquire new skill skill sets and hone others.  "
good,"Typical Call Center atmosphere. The possibility for growth in the current department is non existent for the last 4 years. Good place to start off at, do not expect to move up quickly."
good,Great place to work but for an IT Pro there is very little to no advancement. Expect to have a dead end job. The benefits are fantastic and that helps a lot. Its a company that you could spend years even decades at but don't expect to move up unless you want to move.
good,loved working here. great team work. management was easy to talk to. fun environment. store can get real messy so recovery can be a task.
good,Got to work events and experience a lot in the complex marketing department of the Wells Fargo Center.
good,The ground floor to my current career and where I began to learned what it meant to work in a business environment.
good,"Typical day: get in the QUE/take calls (1st shift), convert incoming calls to opportunities, close deal, team meetings or individual call review, 1/2 hour lunch and two 15 min breaks, follow up to close deals that were not closed on the phone, take more calls (2nd shift). "
good,Great company with promising future especially with the purchasing of Time Warner Cable and NBC
good,"Loading truck with parts, and figuring out most productive route. Installing internet cable. Hardest part of the job was meeting the on time guarantee when I ran into technical difficulties. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer satisfied."
good,"A typical day would consist of getting to work, determining the equipment that may have been needed for each job, and then leaving the shop."
good,"I learned that customers want to fill valued as a they are assisted in any number of issues on opening greetings to empathic listening, and how where our standards for your services for the month or date of services. "
good,My typical day at the office i would take about 300-400 calls per week. Great work environment and excellent co-workers. i loved helping customers with their cable related questions and billing inquires.
good,"The only thing i enjoyed from working at startek was the extreme Little amount of customers calling in everyday. "
good,Hardest part of the position is getting through the cold winter and snow.
good,"My responsibilities at comcast included scheduling appointments, keeping track of the technicians daily schedule, and collecting payments. This job included filing paperwork and keeping track of inventory. The hardest part of the job was having an unsatisfied customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxed working environment where everyone would get along great."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Comcast Spotlight.  I learned a lot and strengthened my skills.  The people were energetic, worked hard and played hard.  I appreciate having the opportunity to work for such a great company."
good,"A typical day at work would be to answer incoming calls and answer customers concerns about billing, cable, phone, or internet."
good,"Like talking to people to see what they like to watch for entertainment and to help them understand the services of cable,high speed internet and home phone service."
good,"Working with Customers face to face "
good,On an average day my co-workers and I work at a high stress level capacity with a serene attitude.  I identify anomalies and engage the appropiate personnel to conduct and investigation and produce a resolution.  The most enjoyable portion of the job is the co-worker relationship.  The hardest part would be the lack of communication with other departments to produce a resolution.
good,"At Comcast I assisted customers with trouble shooting phone, internet, and television services in a fast paced Call Center.  From setting up home & business networks, to resetting modems and routers, to configuring the cables during the installation of television cable boxes.  I enjoyed Comcast because unlike many other Call Centers I have worked for, every call was entirely different from the call before it.  Call Center jobs tend to have a lot of  monotony involved but as a Tech Support Specialist with Comcast that was not the case.  Every call was completely different than the one before it.  I enjoyed the commission bonuses we would receive if we ""up-sold"" to customers during the process of assisting them.  The hardest part of the job was avoiding a technician from needing to go to the customers home in order to fix service issues that could not be fixed during the short time frame we were allowed to stay on the phone with our customer.  That mixed with poor Management is what truly made working for Comcast go from an amazing experience, to a mediocre one at best."
good,I enjoy going to work. Its a different experience everyday.
good,The hardest part of the job was finding solutions to help assist customers because the proper training wasn't given. I had the best supervisor she was always willing to help NO MATTER WHAT even when most of the time she may not have known the answer.
good,"I take calls 8 hrs a day assisting customer with their technical issue pertaining to internet, cable tv and phone service."
good,"The pay is good and u have vacation time available, but your schedule is set with no flexibility, leaving u to work every Saturday unless by some stroke of luck your request is approved for that day off. Management don't care about your concerns, and treat the employees like school children."
good,"Management and co-workers were great to work with, and i enjoyed being around them. The hardest part was having customers yelling at you and calling you down because there TV isn't working.I learned that I'm not meant to drive a desk, I'd much rather be moving and working outside."
good,it was a great working there while it last place closed down and relocated
good,"Talk To Customers About Bill, Plans, Channels, Internet, Cable And Phone."
good,"Nice place to work, relaxed environment. I enjoyed working here part-time."
good,The benefits are excellent.  High call volume at times.  If you can sales the pay is tremendous.  The company tries to keep the atmosphere light by having friendly competitions and great food days!!
good,"I like working at Comcast but the only thing that I dont like is that you really can't advance in the Company, and when you get into one department its hard to reapply for another department. It seems like you have to know someone to get ahead."
good,"I started working for Comcast in 2001, which at that time it was AT&T Broadband.  At any given time I have worked tow to three peoples job.  I learned a lot by doing this, but on the other hand worked a lot of hours.  "
good,"I worked in Retention, which is, customers who call in to cancel their service, I had to retain as paying customers by any means necessary. As far as customer service, there were many frowns I was able to turn upside-down. In addition, I grew a bit in the company and took a lead role. I would deal with escalations and supervisor calls throughout the day. The hardest part of my job was making my sales quota (3%) which means selling to customer who are calling to cancel. (A customer with cable and internet, I would have to sell them phone... somehow) Not as easy as it sounds, since most of the sales were Digital Phone, and not many people have a use for a landline, or the customer is so angry they are offended at the fact you tried to sell to them. It was very difficult because not only was i taking my own calls, but dealing with escalations as well. So it hurt my Target Sales Close rate.  However, the management is fantastic. They are very personable. and during coaching sessions, they give great feedback to improve your overall performance. "
good,Structured work environment. excellent Customer Service training. Company was not employee-friendly. Great co-workers. 
good,"Typical day consists of operating phone and assisting customers with billing, sales, and technical inquiries. "
good,Loved working there till my job moved. loved the people i worked with. Wish the management was more forth coming.
good,a typical day is when all the comcast sites go down. then day will be hectic with all high severity issues. everyday there was something new coming in in the website. management were helpful and always had good opinion on the task taken up. The hardest part of job was managing a shift alone with so many high severity issues. i did enjoyed each and every day of my work.
good,"A typical day at work was calling customers about escalated issues. I learned cable data, S.R.G, Routing, ER. Management was okay. Some of the co-workers was really hard to get along with. The hardest part of the job was working with the employees. The customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Good Company to work for fast paced call center"
good,"A typical day on Monday was to get in early, assess the emails and tasks for the week. Write down a too due list for the day, along with three goals I wanted or needed to achieve for the week.  While I was at Comcast I learned how to project manage my work load and deadlines, while working to help others with there's. "
good,A great place to work with many verticals which allows exposure to various supporting elements of the business.
good,Was fair but not enough support by management when needed. Depend more on peers for direct support mostly. Too much focus on sales rather than focus mainly on service issues.
good,I was in control of a company truck with thousands of dollars in equipment. Also i had to manage my time slots to finish my route without any complications. fun and challenging workplace.
good,Busy call center environment. Learned a lot about the business. Management was available for questions and review. Co-workers were avaialble to assist. Enjoyed meeting new people every day.
good,"As a retention agent I took 60-75 calls a day from customers who wanted to downgrade or cancel their services. It was my job to convince them other wise. At first I loved my job, the environment was fun and energetic and my pay was great. 8mos down the line the company changed the commission structure to where commission only paid out once a month. The metrics for stats had changed from being a ""saves"" goal to a ""sales"" goal. I'm not a sales person in the least so with this change the job was no longer a fit for me. The one area that I loved about the company is the fact the hired from within prior to going external. I think had they kept their metrics the same and attainable the turn over rate wouldn't be so high."
good,"always interrupting one project to start another. always changing procedures and software tools, instead of focusing on production and quality."
good,Best job i ever had. Everyone is Helpful and nice and easy to get along with.
good,Too many people involved in selling process. Great co-workers and supervisor. Prepare to work long hours and forget about days off. (Even though as a DSR one gets two days)
good,Comcast is a good stepping stone for a better career. The daily workload at Comcast can and for the most part is very stressful. Some of the supervisors are very good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job for the employees is maintaining their attendance.
good,"My previous job gave me a lot of experience in project management, editing projects such as MSDS sheets, PowerPoint presentations, technical advisories, collateral rebrands, and etc using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop."
good,"A typical work day consist of logging on to the phones and immediately taking calls. I worked in the Sales Dept. during my last year so, I mainly received calls for new service or upgrades to existing service. Management was very driven by the advancement of the company and the products we sold. However, the execution was not very organized to me at times. For the most part, it was a great place to work. I enjoyed my co-workers who are now long time friends. I loved the fact that if you applied yourself and your skills that it wasn't very hard to move up within the company."
good,from the phone and use of the computer troubleshooting different television and internet issues. enjoy helping to recover customer service of setting appointment for a repair tech to come out. Handling the customer billing issues or internet issues. adding of upgrading service where needed.
good,"You recieve lead sheets of previous Comcast customers that were currently with Verizon. Your job was to win those customers back to Comcast(Xfinity). I learned a great deal about sales and am a better sales person as a result. The training was great. Management was great also there really cared about each individual and would do anything you needed them to do for you to succeed. My co-workers were great I met alot of life-long friends. The hardest part of the job was when you didn't get any sales because we were paid 100% commission, no sales no pay. the most enjoyable part of the job was you could basically make your own hours. You essentialy are self employed."
good,"Long hours, learning about cable and internet, management was out of touch with the current work load. Coworkers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with time limits on when jobs had to be completed. Most enjoyable part of job was helping customers."
good,"I liked the fact i dont have to go to the office,i actually log into my job via a PDA. The dispatchers would send me my jobs.Iget to work on my own. Alot of time other techs would run into a problem and call me for help.Some time the supervisers get upset when im trying to the customers help and it is taking longer or you cant find the problem."
good,"Third level tier support for Comcast software and hardware for both home and office computing, from setup to ongoing problem determination and solutions. This is a customer service position with direct customer contact on diagnose issues to solve customers problems. High speed internet support from sub-station nodes through fiber optic all the way to customer’s homes and office wiring, Also microwave satellite feeds from head end through cable to data retransmission analyzer TV boxes.

Which also includes Blackberry, iPhones and all other wireless devices using TV, internet and email. I also support video set up and sustain picture quality from analog to digital high definition. I also support sales, equipment install while also support billing."
good,"I enjoyed working for Comcast for a couple of years. I enjoyed helping customers who called in for help. My fellow workers are good people to work with because they wouldn't mind taking there time to help. Mangers and Supervisors are very hard to find when you really need help with helping a customer problems. They come down at you when you take to long to help a customer who is frustrate and is in need of helping. You have to keep a good Chart for your performance and time on the phone with customer. They say you don't have to sell, but they keep on pushing and pushing to make the sales. We were told to just "" ASK "" the customer if they want to upgrade or side grade there products; a product that already giving them problems in the first place."
good,"very fast paced. dealing with customer complaints was not fun, but when you can help a customer find the right package for entertainment purposes that makes it all worth while."
good,COMCAST provides a safe and healthy environment to work in. There is a diverse mix of people working in this happening place. Even though it is a large company it is an innovating company and you feel like you are part of a startup.
good,Excellent job for beginning a career!! Excellent benefits and discounts with many local and natiowide companies.
good,Responding to incoming calls to evaluate customers issues. Deal with extremely irate customers.
good,*I would diagnose modems/cable boxes to Comcast specifications and fill orders for sub-contractors
good,A good start job for entry level support experience.
good,"This was the best job I ever had. I checked in a few times a week for meetings and to turn in paperwork. I wasn't on a clock, didn't work by the hour, and pretty much managed my own time as long as I made my numbers. I loved the freedom. I gained some life -long friends over the years and what I learned is that selling fits my lifes purpose and that I really am pretty good at it. As with any other job, there were some co-workers I preferred and some just worked 'around'. I went thru alot of managers over the years and some were friends aquired and others I don't care if I never see again, in life, especially one who threw me under the bus, after authorising me to do something then lying about it when a customer thretended to sue the company, which cost me my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people, gaining and retaining new customers and I made a decent living at it."
good,"You will learn much about how to sell and account acquisitions. However, there is no guarantee of jobs seeing as though a massive layoff is coming up."
good,I enjoyed working for this company they had very good management as well.
good,Its a good company to work for as a whole. However the managers and supervisors who are out of touch with the job description and position requirements only specialize in paper pushing.
good,Answer phones for new services and help customers with existing accounts.
good,I wouldn't recommend working for Comcast if you have a family with high demands.
good,I worked for this company for 10 years and advanced without trying. The benefits are really great and pay was good but I don't know what it is now. The problem is they have layoffs. I got laid off after 10 years and they won't rehire me.
good,My typical day at work is to go to the field and go door to door and sell to potential new customers. Over coming objectives to why not to go with comcast while convincing them to become a customer. I have learned alot about people and time management skills with this employment. The hardest part of the job is to get customers to pay thier deposits on their accounts. The most enjoyable part of my job was my managment team and the freedom to make my own decisions.
good,Is a very good place to start in customer service industry where there is enough training and guidance to learn in about sales and products that is offer to assist customer needs.
good,Comcast as a communications company has many great attributes and services. This company continually seeks to add to the customers experience and selection choices.
good,"I open all applications, review any emails that require assisting first such as follow up on Accounting, technician trips, corporate escalations if any, kudos. Then I receive sales,repair, billing inquires calls and try to accomodate the customer in 6 minutes or less while smiling and trying to please the customer and company at the same time."
good,Accessed customer issues regarding billing and technical issues.
good,A typical day at work consisted of answering phone calls all day. The work itself is pretty easy but it can become mentally stressful at times.
good,"too number driven, too many department changes.great incentives"
good,"Typical day at work consists of angry customers and you not being able to say anything except ""i apologize"" or i understand"
good,"When you come into work, most days, you are taking calls left and right with no breathing room until breaks or lunch. Your calls need to be under a certain amount of seconds but you have a lot of information to put in those few seconds along with all the troubleshooting. It's not bad taking calls back to back but you are graded each month and your metrics count to what shift you get and what days off you get and how much money make. So if you happen to have a bad couple of months then you don't get a good shift."
good,As a communication tech with the company you learn the dynamics of the cable industry.The company also relies on teamwork and communication to be productive
good,It is a great place to work but unlike most jobs you must produce daily.
good,Large Company with large company goals. The workers there are nice. The local branch is over few local employees now and most is ran by division.
good,Job very stressful. day can be so bad that you end up bring work (bad vibes ) home. It's not the company that makes its stressfull its the some many irrate customers.
good,The company has good pay structure for hard workers but the call center environment is full of drama. The level of professionalism was quite low. Opportunities to move up within the company were more about who you knew than the caliber of your work.
good,Compensation was performance driven so that was good. Training for new positions could have been better. Manangement needed improvement.
good,"This employer provided an incredible benefits package, It also provided job stability however there was very little room for growth and it was also very difficult to balance work with a family life. There were shift changes at least every 6 months."
good,"Comcast is focused to make the ""customer experience"" their best product. In support of this, Comcast has been working to make sure the employees enjoy their work through annual surveys, supportive management, and competitive medical benefits."
good,Great company. I am in Sales and the goals are high. There are many different departments and opportunities. For the right candidate this can be a great career.
good,Do have to say there is very little communication on certain changes in policy and procedure. Tools do have a low rate of success. The culture is the biggest benefit meetings lots of fun and diverse people.
good,Comcast is great place to work but it is not a family friendly job. Hours are long and if you have emergencies you have to have the time to call out or shift switch with someone who is nice enough to take your shift.
good,"Not a bad place to work. I can assure you, you’ll grow from the experience. Benefits are great, the people that you work with, makes it even better. It’s very inclusive and diversity there is wonderful. Who you chose to love or the color of your skin, does not matter. "
good,"Typical day consists of driving to areas and maintaining and fixing hardline cable issues. I enjoy helping customers, but dislike how physically demanding the job can be at times."
good,Comcast was a very nice place to work for years ago but as they got bigger new policy and changes were made that made working there very difficult. And the new management did not make good decisions therefore making the work place stressful.
good,"Management, fellow employees and general atmosphere is friendly, inclusive and almost like a family. Everyone is willing to help out and work together. I thoroughly enjoy the work itself. My issue is that advancement opportunities are much more limited than promised and compensation is not adequate."
good,Comcast is great as long some managers are terrible and make you wanna quit. It’s a fun relaxing place your team is like your family be prepared to talk to at least 40-150 people a day. Most days back to back calls
good,Comcast had its ups and downs. i enjoyed learning new things and helping the customers to solve their issues along with earning the bonuses. i trained others to do a great job and how to land a sale.
good,"Great place to work with game room, sleep room and fun special events all the time. Another example is the top 10 preforming associates get what's called the ""Golden Ticket"" meaning you can build you own schedule. I won one last year!"
good,My Tenure with the company has been worth while. I have had the opportunity to network while meeting some great business minded individuals. This company has a culture that outshines its name.
good,"Great Company , work hard and they will reward you. However , my reasoning is more in detail I have been there for over 4 years and resigned due to how bad my calls were getting , it wasn’t really sales at that point more customer service."
good,Company offers great benefits including discounted services that they offer. Job security is a concern as nost jobs have been regionalized. Employee interaction is very good.
good,"I worked here for three years. Management was great, though the workload was heavier than some because of the size of area of responsibility. Jobs are in a pool and assigned to individuals. if Individuals fall behind for a time frame their remaining jobs are added to the pool, if you work had and are ahead, those jobs may be moved over to you with no reward or recognition, it then just becomes your responsibility. I personally didn't have a problem with this, though others were vocal. this Job is as much customer service as it is anything else. you will enter homes from hoarders to extravagantly rich and are required and expected to treat every customer with the same amount of professionalism. Overall, I enjoyed my time with the company. They try their best to keep morale up with prize give aways, (televisions and yeti coolers), and meals, (lobster boils, breakfast on meeting days), and it works for the most part. though you work alone it can be very team oriented, as you work as teams within areas."
good,Strict target rules for selling. It may seem reachable but not all calls will be related to sales. This brings down your score & effects your income d
good,Great benefits... not much room for advancement. Working from home is nice. Communication across departments could improve as well as escalation procedures
good,"Management, in many cases, lacks the willingness or ability to be effective leaders.  Personal goals outweigh company and group needs.  Products are often sold to customers before engineering and development are really complete."
good,Comcast as a whole is a great company we follow a very specific plan but the opportunity for advancement leaves something to be desired becoming a supervisor is difficult because rather than looking for talent with in they prefer the outside sector where often time the agents have more training than the supervisors managing them
good,"I worked at Comcast for over 12 years, in the 12 years it took me 5 years and a degree to move up in the company. The reason they gave me for to be able to move up was because I did not have a degree, so I went and got one. But I was unable to move up after I received my degree."
good,Comcast is a good job. pays well but the hours are crazy and you have to deal with the elements year round. you also cant be afraid of heights because you have to climb telephone poles from time to time maybe once or twice a day depending on what side of the city you work in.
good,"I have spent almost 8 years here at Comcast. I was given many opportunities and had exposure to cultural and educational events. The benefits of working go beyond just discounts, it has given a comfortable lifestyle and help support charities and communities I grew up in."
good,"The culture at Comcast is amazing, they strive to offer all the benefits and support needed to advance your career. Mentorship programs, employee relationship groups are some of the perks I took advantage of."
good,Good place to work. Sales Rewards are very nice. Typical day at Comcast Business consisted of ..Reaching out to potential customers by phone and door to door in order to reach the decision maker and discuss solutions to their business concerns. Close deals.
good,"It was a 8-5 ish style, where you drive around and constantly give support to different people. I learned customer facing service and w how to defuse issues. The different locations i have worked at havffedie rent managment. The hardest part of the job was being treated like an ant just making numbers look good to upper managment. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with and meet"
good,"Comcast has a lot of room for growth if you are flexible on where you work (travel). I was able to work several departments other than one, it was the same with upper leadership minimal effort in developing the direct reports. Communication is limited with a company that size. With that said my time at Comcast was amazing and I was able to navigate my career until it was time for a change."
good,"Comcast is a fast growing company with a great culture."
good,Typical Day: Team Meetings to get the team motivated. Discussed results and plans for the day. Learned the real value of team work. Comcast allowed for the culture to grow depending on location and role. I enjoyed helping team member succeed.
good,My location was in a call center environment. Comcast will assist with education related to positions at Comcast. The most enjoyable part of my position was assisting my internal customer's...the employees.
good,"Great guys to work with, always helping each other. Doing charity work twice a year. BBQ once a month. Very strict protocals for hittin your numbers with no call backs each week."
good,"Comcast was a nice place to work but management was questionable in certain departments.  There was definite favoritism, gossip, and drama on a daily basis but if that is something you can ignore, it pays well."
good,"Working at Comcast has had its ups and downs. Many of which eventually corrected themselves. However one of the key things I've found working for this company is that the higher you go more dysfunctional it really gets. They have been trying to change but it all still comes down to money. It makes sense they're a for profit business, but they are willing to sacrifice the Employee and Customer experience for a few extra cents."
good,"Great entry-level place to get into the field and grow so skills can be taken elsewhere.  Comcast is the lowest paying company for the field of network engineering, by a surprising margin."
good,"Being a member of the Leadership in a Comcast Call Center was a great experience.  The pace was often referred to as ""changing the tires on a moving car""."
good,"working for the call center at comcast I learned a lot about sales, such as talk points, relating to the customers, and addressing questions and/or concerns. For me the hardest part was following the call flow that we all have to adhere to. without the call your scores for quality are low and according to the management you are losing sales. Other than that the work culture is pretty friendly and can be fun at times. Pay is great. I'd definitely recommend this job for those who are sales driven and patient."
good,"They hire anybody  willing to work for the low pay."
good,"I would say Comcast is a very diverse place to work, a typical day at work would be to answer at 9 or more calls per hr, troubleshoot cable, internet and phone service with the customer."
good,"Comcast was a very interesting place to work at, and while I wouldn't say it was a bad place to work, it certainly didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. The company treats it's employees pretty well and has a great product for sale; the problem comes in the execution, and the competitive nature of sales. There are many people who are willing to do shady things in order to increase their own sales goals at the expense of the customers, and even fellow employees. Different branches of the company are often at odds with each other. For example; Call centers and brick and mortar stores often compete for each others sales, even stealing them from time to time. Technicians and Sales Consultants play the blame game on each other when a customers service isn't working properly, giving  customers the runaround, etc. And while this may not be a company wide issue, my store in particular had many management issues. As a part-time employee, there were many weeks where I had to work 40 hours because we were understaffed. I went through 3 managers before leaving my store, and for a period of time we had NO MANAGER for about 3 months. The duties of the manager fell upon our ASM and other team members, raising the stress levels of the entire team to pick up the slack."
good,"This is a good place to work if you don't have a college education.  The pay if fairly competitive and there are plenty of other departments you can transfer to if you don't like your current role.  However, you have to remember to be aggressive about your pursuits in the company because if your not you will be forgotten."
good,"Comcast is a solid overall job. The starting pay is below average, but it can climb as long as you do decent work. Benefits are quite good compared to other employers. Dealing with customers can be good and bad. The culture overall seems to lack direction. It seems like we are jumping from problem to problem randomly."
good,I worked hard at Comcast but efforts and results appreciated by management.  I loved the workplace culture.  Great opportunity for those coming straight out of highschool:  tons of employee and leadership development.  Those on the technical side of the business could definitely grow their career if they wanted to.  Comcast has a great partnership with on-line universities and tuition reimbursement program as well as a leadership grant.
good,"The people working at Comcast in the local markets are a good team and focused on the customer. The Corporate people have a clear vision for leading the company and being focused on the customer too, however that focus seems to get lost as it works down through the layers of management to the front line.  If Comcast as a whole truly understood what good customer service a care is, then they would become much more successful."
good,Comcast is a great company to there employees with the exception of advancement opportunities and there pay scale. I have never known of any cost of living increases since I've been here.
good,When I left I felt like I was being pressured into quitting due to not getting pay raise. I went for 2 years not getting a raise for due to needs improvement.When I asked for more training from my supervisor I was given some short term. I was told this isn't cable 101.
good,"Great place to work, however, there is no job security.  The company is constantly doing re-organizations and layoffs are always a possibility.  They do provide good health, dental, and vision benefits and great discounts on services."
good,Overall Comcast is a good company to work for. Great benefits and opportunities available as long as your willing to relocate. Workplace environment is highly dependent on the market you are in.
good,"The people that I worked with were great, The jobs where great and you learn a lot. The pay was ok but could have been better. I would work at comcast again.  It was not the company, it was the supervisor"
good,Contracted employee. Do not receive any benefits from Comcast. Those that I work with and work for are great. Overall the people in the company both contractors and FTEs are very good to work with. A professional though relaxed atmosphere.
good,The work was difficult dealing with angry people for 10 hours straight but the pay was decent and my supervisor was awesome. The team that I was on made sure that everyone went home feeling good.
good,The facility was great and in a great location.  The benefits were great but as a leader the environment was very stressful.  You had to be a certain type of leader to lead their.  Management was not as friendly to the leaders as they were to the agents
good,"Job has good benefits and pay. The perks are very nice, great amount of time off, great discounts. On that note, this job is highly stressful and it is definatly not for everybody. Company has very strict attendance policy which adds to the stress of it's employees."
good,"A typical work day is fast paced. I created orders, created PowerPoint Presentations and cofirmed that all options are up to standards whether it is financially, socially and overall confirm the great options of qualite control. I confirm items that are supposed to be dispersed accordingly."
good,very stressful job troubleshooting customer s internet and phone services. almost all the calls are irate customers and you spend half of your day apologizing for things out of your control
good,"Good company to work for.  Enjoyed working with the employees. "
good,Great place to work at. Each tech at my location has a locker that I can put equipment in for their service calls. Each day I fill these lockers with new equipment and take back the used equipment from the techs. I utilize the company's software programs like Oracle and EIS to process everything.
good,"Arrive at work, clock in, Get my register, count the bank bag, order change, open XStore, check Kiosk, stock, open computers, open doors, Sell all day, end the day, close all computers, remove Kiosk cash boxes, count drawer, count kiosk, close store,clock out"
good,"Paid training, hourly pay + Comission, benefits, Scheduling sucks until you get to be one of the tops performers so you’ll be stuck in a bad schedule for a while."
good,"Culture has was good, well rounded group of people.they kept the diversity of the company very open. Gave you the opportunity to really expand your horizon."
good,Comcast is a great place to work for with room for growth.staff was great .the education in the telecommunications field was interesting. And very challenging
good,this was  decent company to work for.  It was pretty standard for a customer service job.  Nice people to work with and supervisors were there to lead us and cheer us on when it was busy.  They kept our spirits up in many ways.
good,"A fast paced company, Technicians make good pay and can progress up the Tech path pretty quickly if they're good. the perks are good like free cable and internet, lunches, quarterly bonus'. The job can be demanding at times, a mandatory weekend day is required unless you are a manager."
good,"review projects, possible customer affecting issues, plan daily duties for Technicians."
good,"Safe work environment as long as you follow rules, you’re able to start your day from home. Pay is ok at start, but as you progress through the ranks you are able to earn more."
good,"Before the CEO of Comcast died, he culture and job that I was performing was fantastic.  Shortly after his death, major changes took place and we were turned into a call center.  This was a bad change.  Couple that with the ridiculous customer satisfaction questions that were required on every call, the job became a place I did not want to be."
good,Good place to work in the telecom industry. Employee group is generally focused and hard working. The benefits are strong. The size of the company offers opportunities.
good,"Comcast provided good pay, sufficient training, good benefits. The work environment was decent but the work atmosphere was not always the best. Customer Service training and standards were not addressed enough for me, hence, Comcast was always listed as poor or in the bottom rankings in Customer Service nationwide."
good,"Everyone seems to be out for themselves (management included). As with all call centers there are clicks within each team and there are people that will throw you under the bus for something that they did but won't give you credit for what you have done for them or assisted them with. Overall, the company has great benefits but lacks in the communication area. When there is a system issue or outages upper management does not communicate this with the front line employees to ensure that they can assist customers better."
good,"•	Makes outbound calls to existing customers to sell products such as xFinity Internet, xFinity Voice or xFinity Video."
good,Good company with solid performance.  Comcast Spotlight is the advertising side of Comcast.  Very competitive business and requires employees to work independently.
good,"Good Company For opportunity for Jobs People Inside Integrity all Company . Good Payroll for Year, Benefits Health , 401 K , Vacation Pay,Days personal,"
good,Job requires you to make on job decisions for completion of work to spec and requirements of the company. Installation of services and troubleshooting of individual and system issues.
good,"Without commission I don't see anyone working at comcast, that's the only way you can survive and keep your insanity, it will be stressful for many because goals are set as a Center and not individual and its all about revenue and meeting metrics set by the company to survive"
good,Ive learned alot throughout my years/career at Comcast. The position i'm in allows me to interact with my internal and external customers with providing excellent customer service at a fast pace
good,"Door to door sales of cable tv, home phone, internet and home security. The sales strategy and compensation changes often. You will be assigned an area and will be responsible for acquiring new customers."
good,"Good Place to work on the leading edge of technology!! "
good,"The workplace culture at Comcast varies from somewhat cold and formulaic to warm open and friendly, depending on the department that you are working with."
good,"The people you work with each day are great, however local management is poorly involved and even less supportive of daily needs. There is a disconnect between departments."
good,You have to put in what you want to get out of it.  Make sure you treat others as you would like to be treated.  Allow yourself time to get to know people and make sure you have a clear understanding of the job you are there to perform.
good,"in bound call center for billing department of Comcast. Also had to do sales to meet monthly goals. 8 hours work days,5 days a week. Set schedules with some flexibility options."
good,"A typical work day involves dealing with customer reported issue and trying to address those issues in a timely fashion. "
good,Money and sales targets lead this business.  For management can lead to long stressful hours but the compensation available is fantastic.  Comcast is trying to be an organized engine but missing some key corporate training abilities.
good,Comcast is great place to launch a career in the telecommunications field. There is tremendous head room for advancement and movement within the company.
good,"Fast paced, stressful phone sales.  High pressure to sell something every call.  Very scripted in what you have to say.  Meetings and coachings get cancelled so there is not opportunity to be coached."
good,"Decent job with reasonable pay and benefits. Great management team, but don't go in expecting much career growth potential. Promotions consist of rearranging those already in a higher level position with the occasional bump up to supervisor for the person working there for 10 years plus. Its your typical office job, expect to come in to random last minute workload responsibility changes. Hope you enjoy clicking left and right a few thousand times a day!"
good,"I worked for a contractor, who was contracted by comcast to install business class wifi modems an telephone systems to sell comcast business class  customers"
good,"Welcome place to work with daily door to door sales, ability to meet a vast amount of different people. Never a boring day. Hard to work through inclement weather. But a good place for employment"
good,"checking you're route, getting there on time and providing the best customer service for the customer. "
good,"Customer focus was at the heart of everything we did at Comcast.  Worked for a VP who was stern, stoic, intelligent and allowed growth assignments and supported his employees."
good,I was with Comcast for 4 years. The call center was great but management has gone downhill. They pull calls and coach to all lines of business. Even when pitched all lines still finds the negative out of the call regardless of how well you are performing well. Shift bids come once a year and then you are locked into a schedule. I started with nights and still currently working nights.
good,Really enjoy the randomness of the customer issues to resolve. Being able to provide the best services make it an easy job. High turnover rate constantly having to train new people.
good,Great place to work with great benefits. The schedule is not bad and you are able to get rewarded for being a top performer. The job is always changing which keeps the job interesting.
good,"Assist customers with applying their payments and placing orders for cable, internet, phone etc., balancing receipts to batch and maintaining inventory. I learned to be a very good active listener,strong problem solving skills, excellent interpersonal, communications and relationship building skills. The hardest thing was the selling part because I am more of customer service person. The most enjoyable part was helping people solve their issues/concerns."
good,"A typical day would include importing, reviewing, and scheduling advertisements. There is a lot to learn but it can be interesting if you are into advertising. Management is hit or miss and can be a long process for someone in management to be removed if there are flaws. The hardest part of the job is when there is a lot of work and short deadlines. Also, some of the work is monotonous, which can make some employees extremely bored with the work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits of free cable/internet. Sometimes the office treats the employees for food/snacks and hosts annual dinners/outings."
good,Good and dependable . The day is very stressful buy pay is good. The hardest part of the job is long hours. He enjoyable part is the great benefits. The management is fair.
good,"I was in Direct sales with a base pay plus commission. Benefits were amazing.  Great 401k plan, medical was awesome and incentives were good. But sometimes, you had to work long hours to get a sale.  you have to do a LOT of walking and face a LOT of rejection.  But the high you get from closing a deal was worth it and when overdriving your goals, the sky was the limit and so was the money!"
good,"Very fast paced work environment, yet very fun. The employees are what makes it so much fun.Very good benefits like 401K match and awesome Health Insurance."
good,troubleshoot customer issues had on the job training and management was ok.  the culture was fine and i don't think there was a hard part to the job liked dealing with customers
good,"employees are great to work with, but you don't always feel supported my management. benefits are very good, but are kind of expensive for such a large profitable company."
good,A good place to work... just be very paint with every customer because every customer is unique so is every problem you encounter out in the field. the supervisors will always listen to you
good,This was a place where you can grow but it's a numbers game.  I am willing to strive and compete.  I love meeting goals and excelling in finishing work assinged to me.
good,Work as a Chat PF from home. Flexible schedule but working as a contract position. Great company for advancement as long as you put in the training . Working as a contract position you have flexible hours.
good,"Bosses are great! Compensation manipulated by finance dept. Sell products, get them installed in a timely manner, fight to get paid properly on sold items cause by finance dept process. Unfortunate, but seasoned vets and newbies have no clear indication of what they are making each month."
good,Comcast is a great place to work. It has great management and employees that are always willing to help one another. There is also plenty of training to improve job skills. Comcast offers different events and incentives to keep up employee moral. Comcast also offers the opportunity to work as a Virtual Representative for those who are comfortable with making decisions and can work independently.
good,"Working at Comcast had its pro's and con's. The micro management was over the top. I understand wanting to stay on top of how productive your sales team are, but in my opinion the management team needed to spend more time training and less time placing their thumbs squarely on the backs of the most productive reps. I believe the high turn over rate of the sales representative was a direct reflection of this management style."
good,I love the dynamic of half office work followed by a half of a day of warehouse work. In a addition three days out of the week I have the opportunity to run a delivery route. Ensuring all items are scanned going out and coming in is most critical aspect of the job.
good,Great training and compensation to keep you and the company competitive! Every tool & resource are  available to assist you with pleasing  the customer and closing the sale of an awesome products.
good,Doesn't reward for hard work. Very laid back. Because of team goals allows for hard workers to pull the weight of more laid back employees. Flexible on time needed for non work related events. With the right group of people on a team can be a fun and enjoyable experience.
good,Fun place to work and grow. Management needs to be more responsible for their actions. Fluctuation in commissions and employee incentives. Team builders at restaurants and BBQ at home base.
good,Great company to work for. Atmosphere is fast paced. Can be stressful with quotas and saturation of market. Very flexible with scheduling and client contacts
good,"The benefits are great, and the hardest part of the job is sales. I go in I wait for customers to come in and process payments, try to sell them internet, cable, home phone, or home security."
good,"Great place to work with excellent compensation, good supervisors and fun co-workers.  My present supervisor and some before him really take the time to help and develop their team"
good,"A very competitive, face to face environment with internal & external customers. Teamwork was key & easy since co-workers did not mind helping. Everyone was crossed trained to help out with various duties."
good,The job can be stressful but the people are great. The metrics are ridiculous because they cant move work making you late to jobs and that is part of the metrics. Also repeats kill you which is mostly bad equipment. The pay is a little lower compared to other cable companies in the area but you do get to bring your van home and there are other benefits that even it out. I would recommend working there.
good,"working at Comcast was a good way to show you what you want in life due to the variety of people who come in you get the taste of what you can do and it is stressful out times but its up to you on how you approach the situation, management is good on where you stand, work place is hectic there are rushes and reaching goals sometimes gets hard due the off months but like I said its a good way to start. and I would say try it out if you get the chance but there is a learning curb with the system you work with and its complicated because they don't really help you in depth you have to figure things out on your own and as you go."
good,"overall good job with benefits learned alot of worksource information, some days were easy and others more difficult."
good,pay is not enough they way things changing all over the world and cost of leaving getting expensive day by day. we are not only cable technician anymore we are fully IT professional deal with all kind of device new technology we don't just install cable or TV we do a lot more then that.... for my point of view pay is not enough
good,average place to work. Great teammates.started at 7am worked until all work was completed. plenty of overtime this what your looking for. helped other members at the end of the day.
good,Back to back phone calls from customer and Comcast techs to troubleshoot services and connectivity. Created trouble tickets to document call and resolution.
good,"I worked in three different departments there.  Sales and retention were sales metrics-based.  I then became a go to expert and support role for years.  It was stressful taking many escalated calls, but coaching and developing people offset that experience.  Overall this was a very good job.  The problem is there is so much change it is hard to latch on to a lasting culture which seemingly changes every month.  The company needs work on ethics, but has made major strides in the last 2 years to meet this objective.  Too many reorganizing forces each member to change career path every 2 years including a forced decision to accept severance or take a demotion."
good,The ability to move within the organization definitely exists and management encourages us to look for how we can move up the ladder.  Many opportunities to educate and move to other departments and good benefits.
good,A typical day at work is fast-paced. Sales is highly competitive and sometimes stressful. Never a dull day though. Management listens to the employees. Things are always changing.
good,you can be a hard working employee that turns customers minds around that think poorly of the company. you can bring lots of business to the company even receive lots of great letters from customers. but if there is a small incident they will get rid of you before they know if its serious.
good,Very fast paced job with many ways to create money and earn more. The employees are great and so helpful. typical day at work is fast paced back to back calls not alot of in between makes day go by which is alot.
good,"a really great place to start and grow a career. Always evolving and growing, But just like any other large company the communication from management to employee need work."
good,Can not say too much....Try it you might like it is the best way to say it.....I enjoyed my team. Meetings in the mornings then review best practice at end of the day. Many changes.
good,"While still a ""good"" place to work, with a great benefits package, it is not nearly as fun and relaxed as it was 8-10 years ago. It has gone much more ""generic corporate"" where once it was a stand out exception to the corporate grind. I am sure the employees were much happier before and it made going to work more pleasant as opposed to being a chore."
good,Good place to be if your just out of college or high school to get your feet wet. It can be tiresome and tedious work at time but honest living  to get you stated in the workforce.
good,"The job benefits here are incredible, outstanding, I have never seen how amazingly great the benefits are. This is the most stressful job I have ever had. Once you are out of training you are basically on your own. You have places to reach out but there is no one really to help you with difficult customers."
good,"Service oriented Industry, doing installs and service of Cable tv products. Also did maintianing of FCC mandated system maintenance. However because of a service oriented business long hours no matter the weather."
good,Horrible management. If you can get past the sales managers trying to talk to you like another sale then its great. They act like they are concerned but in the end its not about your well being at all.
good,A typical day at Comcast can be stressful. Customers can be extremely rude and irate. With the right skills and training you should be able to make it through. Have a goal in mind in reference to career development.
good,"Comcast has the best Benefits. It is just stressful to work for Comcast. There is an unbelievable monthly quota and 1 customer every 20-30 mins. If you don't make you quota 3-6 months in a row, you will be terminated."
good,You really have to be built for this kind of job. This is a call center job where you take inbound calls from customers that are typically unhappy for some reason or another. If you can tolerate this type of work then Comcast might be a good fit for you.
good,Working at Comcast is a joy and a pain at the same time. A joy because I love my peers and management. The values at my center are strong and as long as you're working smart then you will get paid accordingly. It is a pain because of the high stress sales environment and lack of job security. Honestly the culture of the job use to be that your job is secure if you do the job right. However they just recently announced to all of us that our Center is closing so now we all are going to be with out in April. The thing that bothered me was that Comcast announced a string of $1000 bonuses the next month. I would of rathered kept my job than received that money. I am dreading having to look for other employment because I like this job so much.
good,The environment was changing and on line advertising was taking over.  Saw the writing on wall and moved on.  Great people that I worked with.  Somewhat fun environment but changed over the years.
good,"Busy company with multiple products to learn about and support. I have learned a lot about network operations, RF and video during my time with them. The workplace culture needs to improve but management is working on that."
good,The work as a communication Technician was a good challenge and you got lots of support from your supervisor. The pay was lacking slightly for the knowledge you should possession to do this job effectively.
good,"fast paced, highly matrixed, good opportunity to learn a lot of different business practices and opportunity to make a significant contribution.  growing pains"
good,"Put my body and soul into Comcast. My first year: ROOKIE OF THE YEAR which is pretty significant for a company of this size."
good,"I learned how to manage my personal time around always being on call for my customers and available for any new customers that may have called me after I left my contact info on their door."
good,Working for Comcast was not a bad experience. The pay was a bit on the low side for the amount of information and systems you have to constantly re-learn. The atmosphere was comfortable & friendly!
good,"I was impressed with the amount of sick pay, paid days off and benefits."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work, I would recommend if you are looking to gain industry knowledge and experience. The benefits are excellent and the pay plus commission is great."
good,"If you can do collections, it's an amazing place to work. Great culture. Management kind of sucks, but it's better than most call centers. No desk sharing."
good,Thankful for the opportunity to work there.  The opportunities for advancement  and my career goals did not align.  I chose to pursue other opportunities elsewhere.
good,Work life is the only life that you will have. The  benefits are good and the morale their fluctuates. Say you can elevate concerns but rarely get address
good,"I had responsibility to meet challenging goals and impact employees lives.  I was encouraged to lead employees and delight customers.  I learned about leadership.  I learned to focus on employee's personal goals and help them achieve their personal goals through meeting company objectives."
good,"typical day included knocking doors educating and promoting comcast to create or generate sales. I learned that you had to catch people at home.Management were great but were very restricted bc unrealistic sales matrix. Culture was great overall and I always felt welcome. Hardest part of job was driving around all day and not getting a sale, or being chased by someones pitbull, or balance of sales vs compensation.Most enjoyable part of my job was freedom to work freely and be my own boss and meeting new people!"
good,"fun and exciting learning something new everyday"
good,"Greats benefits at Comcast, plenty of paid time off. Drawbacks come with management and work-life balance. Especially work-life balance. You get paid training and up to 12 weeks paid maternity or paternity leave. There are lots of tools to help you learn and organize your work. There are groups in opportunities to get involved in the company and the community."
good,"A typical work day at Comcast was great, I loved coming into the office and getting my day started with all of the Good Mornings.The culture was really welcoming and great."
good,"Good company to work for. They offer many benefits, discounts, 401k, time paid off. As a communications technician, there are long days and plenty of overtime. The starting pay could be higher."
good,"days would consist of trouble shooting or installing new services for customer.learned a variety of things from new equipment and services to how the internet and cable really works. Management not so great if your not one to be lets say a ""teachers pet""to get where you want to be.Hardest part of job would be trying to complete a job in the time frame they want you to complete it knowing it takes more time."
good,I like working in Comcast I really did made great friend in management and regular coworkers fam oriented place to work for. However I always felt like I was going to lose my job all the time not sure why a lot of warning in meeting from management to everybody it was not cool sometime and some position was just gone for no reason great people lost there job a lot it was crazy.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company in multiple locations. The environment was good however very competitive. Over time I felt less autonomy was given as the processes and management became more centralized."
good,"All the days are pretty standard for a call center. I learned a great deal from the experiences I garnered and from the advancements afforded me. However, sue to low pay rate, lack of incentives and substandard benefit packages there is a High turn over rate within the company. Upper management cares little for the opinions of those under them which often causes friction. In spite of that I found a family here and I have no regrets about my time with the company."
good,"if you take misery home with you daily, this is not a good job. if you can look at the big picture and deal with stress, you may like it. benefits and pay are ok if you are able to move up quickly."
good,I love Comcast I want to continue working here. I would suggest others apply I want to learn other areas of the company and try new roles/postions. Comcast has made lots of changes to improve its work life balance for their employees and have listened to our concerns. Comcast does not get the acknowledgement it deserves in many cases. I think it is a great company with great products and simply needs to continue hiring great people who care and want to do the work.
good,Comcast was an overall enjoyable place to work at.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement as well as other benefits and employee perks.  There are continuos process changes throughout the year for all positions.
good,Comcast was my first call center I work for so  training was long but knowledgeable and helpful.. the company offerer very good benefits and starting pay  and good perks.
good,"This is a very fast paced and always changing"
good,Comcast is a great company to work for as far as people go. They are kind and caring. The benefits are pretty good. However we are severely underpaid for the work we do.
good,"Fast pace, goal oriented. Take technical support calls,  Troubleshoot customer issues with cable, internet and digital voice services.  Made account adjustments and upsold additional services."
good,"A typical day at work consist of picking up supplies, checking your route,making sure you have proper equipment, meeting  diverse amount of customers."
good,I felt Comcast was a very nice place to work. There are a lot of different opportunities and chances for advancement or just changing your job is attainable.
good,"Great culture and benefits. However, working in traffic is driven by teamwork and deadlines. So if that isn't for you, you may struggle in that enviroment."
good,"Good place to work in my role the hours were long, not enough time to fulfill all of the requirements of the job."
good,"Great company to work for, have to be strong minded to deal with the tension. Great culture oriented, Lots of recognition for great performance. Family oriented company"
good,Do to the fact I really enjoy solving customers issues being a Level 2 Video repair tech gave me the option to tackle and resolve a multitude of issues relating to their Comcast Video Service. I also became extremely proficient as a Cablecard technician allowing my customer the opportunity to supply their own equipment and still allowing them to connect to Comcast services through a device known as a cablecard.
good,I worked for Comcast for 12 years. I was a good place to work. Competitive in pay and benfits. Made lots of friends. I would say that corporate politics and micro managing could be a problem. To many chefs and not enough indians.
good,"As a Manager I have grown through out the years and one thing stayed the same and that is the satisfaction I get to see my team succeed.  Typical day is one on one coaching, observations, assisting customers wishing to speak to a Manager, inventory and admin responsibilities.  Hardest part of my job is when I have failed in developing a customer service representative. I do enjoy working with our customers especially those who were pleased with the service that was provided to them.  I have a great team who work extremely well together."
good,Great place to work. Great job culture and great friends. Comcast is a job that is very competitive with multiple contest and perks. Comcast is also a great place to advance if you want to take your career further. I had a great time there and I will love to stay there but unfortunately I have to relocate.
good,Overall great company workplace culture is friendly and staff is diverse. There is tremendous flexibility in scheduling and time management. Salary compensation is competitive.
good,"I liked working at Comcast, but as an ISP they just were not a great company. There were far too many issues with their services.  A year after I left, they also closed down."
good,"This job gave me a lot of experience first hand and face to face with customers ,and up selling the company's products . I also challenged myself to do a lot of things I didn't think I was capable of doing ."
good,I would classify Comcast as being an enjoyable place to work .  A fun group of employees and helpful.  We did have a stressful job at times but management did take part and jump in when extremely busy on the phones or out in the field.  I enjoyed working in smaller offices more than corporate office but all in all nice place to work.
good,Good management for the most part. Comcast is always keeping you up to date on the new technology too. The pay is not that great if you're in the ad sales part. the salary is very low and the commissions are good as long as you sell 10k plus a month.
good,"Very difficult place to maintain a consistent income.  Comcast makes changes all the time which unfortunately includes pay structure and tools to make sales.  Having high expectations due to the way the recruiter or manager sells the position during hiring process will definitely kill your momentum.  Don't expect to much and definitely, don't expect to make a six figure income."
good,"Overall great company to work for, but if you get the wrong manager or supervisor, it can be difficult.  Benefits are awesome, great discount on cable / internet bill.  Treats employees much better than customers, but they are working on the customer piece..."
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for they offer good benefits, work van, all tools needed for the job. "
good,as long as you are an employee and not an independent contractor you are taken care of very well by this company. I would recommend being hired out right only.
good,The people you work with are fantastic. However the management doesn't provide much support. You have to take a pay cut if you want to advance and even then there's no guarantee you will. You are empowered to go outside of their guidelines and still be negatively impacted for doing so. The verbal abuse is something you just have to get used to in order to collect payments from customers that don't want to pay who will then take surveys on you. basically the customer decides your' paycheck. I learned patience.
good,"Benefits, compensation and work day great"
good,"Good as call centers go, at the time was in a major change in way Comcast handled customer service and there were many changes in how the center operated."
good,Enjoyable experience overall. No complaints. Management flexible with schedules.  Annual increases are exact with cost of living. Good for college students young people.
good,"not very flexible schedule Working an average of 100 hours a pay period, so no shy to put in the long days Mentoring New technicians Self Motivated and Patient with others"
good,Comcast benefits are good.  It seems a little difficult to get promoted timely but overall it's a nice place to work.  Job security is a little uneasy as downsizing occurs every year.
good,"It was a very exciting place to work with many ways to make as much money as you like. I have learned a lot in terms of selling, how to not involve emotions and quickly move to the next possible opportunity."
good,The company treated their employees fairly and encouraged growth and development. I was part of Comcast Spotlight. They offered tremendous training and coaching.
good,"part time work, part time pay. full benefits.. its worth it if your schedule wont allow you to work full time. Comcast offers extra hours and uncapped commission, so there is potential to make full time pay only working part time hours."
good,Plenty of opportunity to grow through multiple organizations. Decent earning potential. Many highly tenured employees (15 yrs +) that speaks well for the company work environment.
good,working outside only downfall was the weather. the people were great to work around and the pay was good.moving up in the company was very obtainable .
good,the typical day is coming in and sitting in your desk and handling a very high call volume of calls both in and outbound. going to daily team meetings and weekly coaching with your sup. most of the management is very positive and nice but they could a touch of reality when they are setting our expectations. the hardest part of the job is the customers and the guidelines we are expected to follow for customer service. other than that the job is pretty easy and very fast pace.
good,"Customer service as always is a structured environment and as long as you're okay with that you will be great.  The benefits of the discounted cable, internet and phone service is great."
good,"Early morning start from some people. Being a Cable, Internet, and Phone provider. I've learned it's crucial for the business to make their quotas. With installations and products.  There job was never hard always fun people to be around."
good,"The different people I got to meet everyday. Some of them were really neat. The networking opportunities are were endless, cause you never know who you would meet."
good,Learned latest IT skills.  Hardest part of the job was heavy lifting.  Always had latest equipment.  Constantly upgrading equipment.  Training was offered occasionally.  Tuition reimbursement was available.  Great health benefits.
good,The benefits are excellent and there is always something new to learn.  The people who work there are great and everyone cares a great deal about what they do.
good,"Working in the Data Entry and Research dept was very pleasant most of the time 16 people working together different jobs for a common goal.  Corrections and Entering customers information of all"
good,"I went ti work,  Did my job,  Had a lunch break Went back to work and then left.  Came back Monday through Friday and did not work on the weekends.I received free cable."
good,Great pt job only issue was the distance from my home to work. The management was excellent family felt environment. Pay not great but its ok for someone for part time unless you're in a different dept. The telesales pay was average
good,My overall experience with working with Comcast has been satisfying for the most part. The benefits are excellent! The pay rate isn't the highest starting out but  they do offer bonuses and annual raises.
good,"benefits are great, free services, cable internet, phone and security.  Pay is not good compared to what others are making in the same field.  Often will spend time to train there employees"
good,"Good job to have, but difficult to advance upward. Good benefits with special perks with other companies (i.e. cell phone discounts, etc.).  Inclement weather conditions warrant better wages."
good,The job is ever changing. When they say to the needs of the company that's what they mean. This is an at will company added on duties sometimes changes your original job description.
good,I was employed at the busiest location (Beaches). There was never a dull moment.  I learned something everyday being as this was a hands on experience. The job itself was not difficult at all.  Everyone worked together.
good,"A company full of hard working, dedicated individuals. Plenty of room for advancement. Looking to lead the telecommunications industry in not only products, but in customer service."
good,"Technical support is a hectic job, no one calls in to say how good of a job Comcast is doing. The Comcast office in Houston though tries and make it easy as possible to work under the very stressful conditions. With TV's near most work stations and an actual quiet room to relax in on break."
good,"its a great way to meet all different types of people all races, cultures, some of the management people are not entirely truthful some will do anything to get a sale which includes lying about promotions"
good,"Great job opportunity , day to day operations were ran smoothly. Gained a great ordeal of knowledge in WFX and CSG as well as understanding the quota portion of Field operations. A huge lack of management assistance at times we wouldn't have any management on the floor or during shifts. Hardest part of the job was having to figure things out by trial and error or by spending some time with other departments . Enjoyable parts of the job were the hours 4am-1pm early start to the day although had plenty of time  afterwards to be able to get personal things accomplished (ie. Doctor's appointments , errons etc.)"
good,"They mass hire for outbound sales, a numbers game, and the turnover is very high; therefore their training costs are high. In a group hire, there may be several persons who might be qualified for other positions within the company, but by the time they are eligible to transfer after six months, they're burned out and resign or quit as the outbound sales is very stressful. I have met some very nice people there."
good,"I work as a contractor for this company, have been since 2010. I love working with the customers and helping them. As for me, I also had the pleasure of working with some great people as well."
good,"Unpredictable day, chasing customer and making sales, meeting different people. Can get a little stressful if you don't know the in and out of getting a sale and being ahead of quota."
good,The minute you learn one job responsibility & become comfortable with it something new is thrown into the mix. Working for this company has taught me exceptional time management and multi-taksing skills along with the ability to be adaptable to any work environment.
good,"The most enjoyable part about working for Comcast is the difficulty of keeping up with all of the changes in policies, promotions, productsZ"
good,"This company offers excellent benefits, security and interesting work.  I have had the opportunity to work there twice.  Once on the Cable side (Cable customers) and the other on the Sales side.  Both experience were very enjoyable!!!"
good,"Enjoyed working with my team of 8 staff members. Enjoyed running my department with no interference."
good,Great work life balance but very little job security. Learned sales opportunities. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and the misinformation from management. The best part of the job is the opportunity for sales and the knowledge to propel an career with the company.
good,"Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be."
good,"No job security"
good,Good place to work but it is downsizing because of technology. I was able to learn as much as I wanted and use all the equipment that I had access too.
good,"Arrive 10 minutes prior to taking customer calls to check emails and do whatever could not get done the day before. (95% Inbound calls).  Take calls and provide supervisory input when necessary with scheduled breaks, and scheduled lunch."
good,"I enjoy my job.  the people are nice and the benefits are pretty good.  it doesn't have room for advancement like the promise.  it is a good work environment,"
good,Cold calling and setting appointments to close deals was the name of the game.  I enjoyed being in front of customer's developing a long term communication plan for their business.  I also enjoyed our sales team. We all worked great together.
good,"Great work environment if you like working independently."
good,"I worked for Comcast for a long time. Benefits are great. I learned so many new things. I worked with many great, smart fun people. When Comcast merged with NBC many good people got laid off."
good,Drive innovation to create the world's best entertainment and online experiences.  Work culture is very unique and they have a lot of great opportunities within the company
good,"Excellent benefits. Management supports employees. Team members are like family. On going training keeps team members up to date  on products , changes. Cross training options are readily available."
good,"Upper management is great ( Directors,VPs) .. lower management on supervbisor level is quite micro managed . good perks and great working envrironment though"
good,Good company. Great benefits and room for advancement. Management is helpful and supportive. Rewarded for job performance and given opportunity to develop as a leader.
good,A typical day at work would involve utilizing and applying analytical skills to solve technical issues. Being in this field also enables interacting with customers to build good relationship for both ones self and the company.
good,"Over all good company, does actually support the work life balance so many larger corporations talk about. "
good,This company was great for enhancing my customer service skills however the management was very childish and did not represent the company well. The benefits were great.
good,Management is a bit one sided. Benefits are good  it can be a bit tiresome working door to door. A lot of rejection. Aaaaaasaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
good,"Insurance is exxcellent. management changes sales targets and has raised quota limits twice. If sales are not achieved in all 4 categories, then put on sales plan for 30 days. Turf assigned by performance not geography and centered around office not home locations.compensation is fair."
good,"Early to get to work prepare for flexability wonderful coworkers,managing customers,saving customers,great benefits"
good,"La succursale a fermée, aucun avantage a donner"
good,"Fun place to work constant employee interactions, Employee training  ,and safe working conditions. Unlimited growth potential good balance between personal and professional life. very understanding management"
good,In my time at Comcast I was able to advance into a multitude of positions.  They are very interested in advancing those individuals that are already employed within the company.  I am very thankful for my time spent with Comcast.
good,this is a great company to work for. Great benefits. No complaints. good job work/life balance with competitive salaries.
good,"Ended my career following 20 years of service."
good,"We are a very micro management based customer and technical server type of company.  If you do not like change in your work place, hours, or type of work, then this is not the place for you."
good,"Well organized but small.  Is efficient, but slow to grow within company.  Limited advancement.  Would have liked to stay within industry."
good,"The job is highly focused on attaining the best customer experience. During my 12 years at Comcast I have had several positions. At each position I was given high end training to preform my duties. Management shared daily and weekly performance measurement to help achieve goals. Management gave clear goals and expectations to achieve year end results. Company offers monetary incentives, quarterly bonuses and luncheons. Co-workers have a spirit of cooperation and are willing to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is dealing constant change of procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job is the comradery  of co-workers, the periodic luncheons, the satisfaction of our clients."
good,"Outstanding people, great benefits. Well balanced work/ home environment. would recommend company to anyone looking for a healthy work/ life environment."
good,"Very good company to work for, competitive salary and benefits, regular educational training for employees.working environment is always acceptable and managers are always very helpful."
good,"Typical day is you getting a minimum of 2 angry customers in your ear but overall you'll adjust and get use to it and learn how to handle people.Its a call center job,people feel bolder when they don't see you face to face so you must learn how to be mean in a subtle way to that the customer understands and you don't get a low alert as well.METRICS METRICS METRICS! Can't stand em,no matter what you do it's always gonna be a lose lose situation with the metrics.If you upsale on every call(Which is required a.k.a. another metric) then you potentially may make someone score you bad on your survey which you need good scores to succeed.If you tell them all the info they need it may take too long and not getting them off the phone fast enough you'll have a hard time with.It's a job built for only certain type individuals who can put up with the ever changing metrics but if you can mold to finding the best method to complete the job at a decent stand point.You'd be okay here."
good,"Answered phones in a fast paced environment, troubleshoot service problems, reviewed bills, posted payments or adjusted bill if needed."
good,":Love my job, but its not boring after doing the same thing for 5 years. I need to be challenged."
good,"Overall Comcast is a good company to work for. Awesome benefits, great incentives and great atmosphere."
good,"Inside Sales Executive"
good,Loved my job.  Enjoyed working with the employees as well as dealing with the customers.  Supervisors were always there to talk to or to assist.
good,"great place to build selling skills, Each month there are incentives and ways to earn more money and win sale trips.  Each customer is different and you're representing Comcast when you're on the phone. Step outside of yourself, be honest and human, treat each call how you'd want to be talked to and you will be successful."
good,"This was a great company to work for that had excellent benefits."
good,"Installing and trouble shooting cable, phone, and internet. The hardesr part about the job was a difficult customer. Co-workers was helpful when needed. I learned alot in the cable world that i didnt kno how to prep wires, run cable line from electric poles to a resident home, how to troubleshoot and fix issues with cables, i learned cable signal, and whats good signal and what level of specs numbers should be in when dealing with cable. The most enjoyable part with cable was seeing a satisfied customer when you fix their issue they were having."
good,"Arrive at the work site at 7:00am. Do a physical inventory check of your equipment pick up additional equipment and materials needed for the day from the warehouse. Clean out and organize your work vehicle. Gather my work team together and have a debriefing about the performance numbers, repeat trouble calls and escalations. Meet with the rest of the employees then head to the first job of the day. I learned how to multitask, troubleshoot, time management and how to effectively lead a team. There was a disconnect between management and the technicians due to lack of communication. My co-workers were great, we worked well as a team and helped each other finish jobs. The hardest part of the job was working in all of the elements and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction."
good,"I love my job as a hadoop admin. It gave me the opportunity to build clusters, implement various eco system components and did do great deal of map reduce."
good,"If you get the right manager, Comcast is an amazing place to work! Co-workers, for the most part, are helpful and great to work with and overall, it really is a very  fast-paced, exciting and  team oriented place to work.  "
good,This is a great place to work.  I have enjoyed working there for the entire time.  The only complaint I have is there is no upward movement available.
good,"Every day is a different day at work. never a boring day."
good,"I very much enjoyed my employment with Comcast but I am ready for a career change and my best friend in Austin, TX has always told me I would be a 100% great fit for this industry and she has been in this industry for over 10 years."
good,"Although I was a project contractor, my time at Comcast was very positive and productive. They provided lunch on Friday's and had a fast paced environment."
good,"Inbound Call Center assisting customers with business orders."
good,A great company to work for and the job was very enjoyable and the co workers were very good at helping each other out. I learned a lot in that environment about electronic funds transfer and direct deposit. The hardest part was not being able to get overtime. The best part was the learning experience from other workers.
good,When you work for Comcast it will repare you for any Retail environment. Great Job teaches you all of the ends and outs of Making sales and running store in retail. You will be set to work for many different jobs as well as in different positions after working for Comcast.
good,"Receiving in material from vendors to ensure we have stock on a daily basis. Any item low or out of stock, I run a report to check, and then make vendor contact to order the necessary quantities. Perform cycle counts on a daily basis to ensure inventory accuracy. The hardest part of my job is picking up added tasks when we have challenges with staffing. Management is not always consistent on providing help in certain areas of the Supply chain department. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that my communication  with my team and vendors allows for us to have stock on cable drop material, safety and non-safety items too. I feel good knowing that my hard work pays off as it shows through all of our spokes in the North East Bay."
good,"Nothing special, just a job. It will get you by but it is definitely not a career. I was making 18.50 an hour as a tech 3. The job wasn't bad but for how much Comcast makes they can definitely afford to pay their techs a little more especially considering the training and qualifications that go into it."
good,"You will learn how to do a opening and closing in their sales pitch. The rest is up to you if you are strong in cold calling then this position is for you, if not then you may struggle due to lack of developmental leadership."
good,"Great day to day environment"
good,"A typical day at work consist of setting up 2 computer screens, logging into the computer, and phone.  making outbound calls to previous customers."
good,"A typical day at work include logging in to my computer making call to customer to confirm, schedule and reschedule customer appointments, and to send info technicians. I learned that its in the delivery and the tone of your voice when delivering  not so good news to customers about appointment they are more receptive. The hardest part of my job was not being able to please customers with appointments being rescheduled. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers get issues resolved"
good,Work on a very good team in marketing department and learned a lot about competitive offering across the National.  I manage the Value Add budgeting and device procurement.  Pain in the behind getting contract approval but very rewarding when all deadlines are met.
good,"A typical day includes interacting with customers to fulfill entertainment needs. The environment calls for a self motivating, goal accomplishing, exciting individual who's there to listen to customer needs and make the  best recommendations."
good,Place was a very friendly environment to work at. Everyone seem to be helpful and team players.  Only problem was the company outsource
good,"During the time I was employed there I met a lot of nice people. A typical day at work is going in and taking phone calls from people who have problems with their phone, TV and internet. We did everything from resetting cable boxes to scheduling service calls, taking bill payments and selling upgrades to cable services. The hardest part of the job was the frustration level when you could resolve a customers issue, but on the flip side of that, the most enjoyable part of the job was resolving their issue and getting them back on track."
good,Taking in calls will not tire you because after helping every customer you will feel satisfied with the experience.I have learned a lot of customer handling skills and communication techniques in the span of time I worked with Comcast.
good,"This job offered a variety of learning opportunities interfacing with external agencies, business partners and creative professionals. The importance of deadlines, legal language and branding guidelines were highlighted and skills upgraded in this position."
good,it was a great place to work very professioanl. I learned alot from working with comcast. before them i had zero experience and now i feel very experienced and only after 2 years of working with them.
good,"Responsible for on time log in, schedule adherence, metrics maintenance, customer care, questions, billing concerns, up sell products and services, one call resolution, time management, multitasking, multiple computer systems."
good,I use to love the freedom of this particular department. Managers were great to me and we did have quite a few perks. Learned new programs with this department and was given opportunities to grow.
good,I enjoy working for Comcast they have great benefits. However career advancement is not something I have been able to achieve even though they helped to pay for my college.
good,"Being at Comcast is great to have the experience of being a better customer service agent. I  have a great supervisor I don't have any complaints about him or any members of management. The only big downfall of the job is the hours, you don't really get to live your own personal life."
good,"I speak to customers throughout my day, resolving technical issues as well as sales, billing, escalations and retention. I've learned how to balance taking care of the customer the 1st time as well as being productive as it relates to the needs of the company and the business. My supervisors and managers are great, they really admire and respect that I am always at and above what my expectations are and they call upon me for many special projects such as holding team meetings, discussing numbers and how to improve them for the team, as well as handling escalations all the way up to a corporate level. My co-workers and I depend upon one another daily because we have the capacity to resolve issues on our own. There is no hard part of the job if you have the correct attitude and give a good effort to use the tools provided to get the job done. What I enjoy most is resolving the issues with the customer and knowing they left with a good impression of me and the service I gave, as well as a good impression of the company that I work for."
good,Back to back calls try to sale and save revenue on every call while trying to provide exceptional customer service in a timely fashion and sale sale sale sale. The hardest part would be back to back of complaints and keep a positive attitude. The most enjoyable was some of the events they hosted for the employees.
good,Was with the company for six years.  This was an inbound sales postion that had potential for growth.  Awesome peers with great attitudes.  Wonderful incentives and cash prizes.  On a day to day can b very diffucult depending on the types of calls that we would recieve. Because we were given many different products to sell to the customers could sometimes be overwhelming but over all very good job.
good,"Inbound sales position with added perks in sales of various products throughout the year. Co-workers were fun to be around, with a lot of team building opportunities."
good,"Great company to work for, excellent work/life balance and company benefits are great. There is not much room for advancement and depending on department the company culture is lacking."
good,Great company to work for. I am unfortunately leaving in order to relocate to another State for personal reasons at this time.
good,"A very busy call center, I've learned how to quickly multitask between trouble shooting and looking over accounts with billing systems, the hardest part of the job is when certain systems malfunction which makes it difficult to solve cx problems. Overall a great place to work."
good,Metrics and hitting your ever changing goals. Having to hear the reasons why your compensation changed every quarter while your job didn't less less then less..
good,"working a 10 hour 4day week"
good,A typical day a COMCAST consited of High Volume inbound calls from customers who wanted to cancel there service. Management was very helpul and eager to guide you to suceed. My co-workers were lovely and I enjoyed our daily conversation. The hardest part of the job was irate customers. The enjoyable part of the job was overcoming obstacles and saving and making customers happy!
good,"My job requires me to work quickly and accurately, meet daily deadlines and help our Account Executives manage their clients cable advertising contracts."
good,Comcast is a nice place to work.  They offer a lot of great benefits. I enjoy the phone calls when I get to help the customers and they are happy at the end of the call.
good,Great job during my undergraduate career. Everyday was a new adventure.
good,I worked there for eleven years and the pay was awesome. Being laid off was rough but my time spend there was a great learning experience and it helped me to become a better customer service person as well.
good,comcast was and is a good company to work for.  You need to be ready to take calls and able to handle the calls even though a customer is upset with the service of the company and they start yelling and screaming don't take it personal cause at times it can hurt your soul.  Usually can take up to 1000 calls per month also can get the customer taken care of answered and seemed pretty happy within 8min or less.
good,Comcast Telesales Dept is not a bad place to work. You have to be focused and be a true go-getter in the dept. You have to make sales in order to make your check. If you make your sales you will have a good check. Some of your co-workers are willing to go the extra mile to help and others aren't. The hardest part of the job is getting people to see the savings when switching the products. The most enjoyable part of the job was only working 4 1/2 hrs a day so I had the rest of the day to be with my family.
good,"Great company, great people, care about the employees lots of opportunity to advance"
good,"Comcast has great benefits to offer to its employees such as discounts on cable and internet, 401k and health insurance...however work requirements change significantly from day to day. Metrics are implemented without considering how they will affect the work of employees. It seems every day more work is added but less time is allotted to complete said work. One technician is expected to rewire an entire home by his/her self regardless of the size of the house essentially doing the work of two or three men sometimes, yet still expected to complete every appointment on time."
good,"afforded the opportunity to learn the industry and advance"
good,"Business development executive with years of experience in technical sales, sales management, team leadership, and business growth and expansion. Proven ability to generate sales and revenue."
good,"Open door policy and able to communicate ideas,concerns, and daily issues openly with management.  Able to share ideas. There's a culture of unity among the co-workers."
good,Inbound sales i took over 35-40 call a day.  I've received many training classes on building and sharpening sales skills.  The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting different people and offering great products.  My co-workers over my eleven years working there i met many great people.
good,"* Sold cable products, helped with billing questions"
good,"Working for Comcast was a demanding job with great payoffs. i was able to use my ability and knowledge of computers to help customers on a daily basis. To be able to diagnose and repair anything commercial and residential networking and cabling issues was very gratifying. I worked long hours but went home feeling good of what I accomplished for the day. I learned leadership skills and technology skills that helped me excel at my job. Once Comcast purchased NBC, I was one of the techs that was laid off. I still would be there today as a manager and loved every minute of my job."
good,Cable business is one of the largest and most profitable businesses and we are at the advent of new era using cutting edge technologies to an organization where technology was mostly on the video streaming and cable delivery services
good,"While at work you answer calls and troubleshoot customers problems. While troubleshooting taking the opportunity to build rapport and promote the benefits of Comcast products."
good,"I love the people I work with, they give it their all everyday. The clients are what makes the job fun and challenging all at the same time. It was a great opportunity to learn and grow in this culture and I appreciate the opportunity."
good,"Comcast is a great company! A typical day at work is pretty flexible, is the place where I've learned the majority of my skills in my resume. The management is ok in general, the co-workers are really nice and helpful. The hardest part was staying late for the month end close, and the most enjoyable part of the job for me was every time when I learned something new."
good,"I loved my Comcast family, due to relocation I'm no longer there."
good,"Excellent benefits but, mismanagement which led to closing of sales dept.."
good,I has been 6 years since I worked for Comcast but it was a great place to work with good insurance and valuable perks.
good,Comcast was a wonderful experience and the benefits were awesome. Wish I stayed longer there instead of taking another position at another job.
good,"Good company to work for, needs to have more management training for new supervisors."
good,"Typical day started with a number of jobs on your route. throughout the day it would change due to scheduling, location of techs and tech skill set. Schedules would always change to meet customer needs. The hardest part of the job is working in all types of weather and then getting the difficult customer. The most enjoyable part for me was to work independently and nor have a supervisor standing right there looking over your shoulder. I was able to think outside the box and implement my way of thinking to resolve issues in a timely manner to suit the customers needs.,"
good,"Overall comcast is a great company to work for if you have everything in your life structured. Comcast had hardly no flexibility for things outside the workplace, management changed so frequently and was hardly any connection between them. If you are a fast learner and independent you will advance very quickly. Get ready for horrible hours until a shift bid is done in which you can get better ones like i did if your performance is great :) They're closing the Alpharetta call center in 60 days FYI..just incase you work there or are thinking of transferring."
good,learned on how to install wireless handsfree kits in different cars.
good,"Hit the office at 11 , get out and knock doors until 8pm. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people!"
good,"It was a productive busy and mostly fun work place. Everybody got along and worked well as a team. Management would often reward us for hitting our monthly numbers. Such as lunches, bowling, game days. However I think management could have been on the floor more and communication could have been a little better."
good,"Once you get your foot in the door, this is a great company to start a career!"
good,I closed the dining area and took customers orders and cleaned
good,I worked on all service/trouble calls for the communal accounts in the North GA area and also the repeated service/trouble calls on residital
good,"Job was a 8-10 day shift, Mon - Fri., Morning Shift."
good,"Atypical day at work was inbound calls, regarding billing, product information, updating accounts, applying payments, conflict resolution. Co-workers team players fun participating in games for competitive incentive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with high stress call volume regarding lapse in payments or equipment not working. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing information and assisting clients in understanding their bill and getting them on the right package for their income level."
good,"Comcast helps technicians grow with technology. As the years go by and technology transform to be more efficient and convenient, Comcast teaches you to adapt to  the new and updated world of technology.  Comcast gives you the most updated knowledge of the upcoming changes to technology and communication."
good,"4 day - 10 hours a day shift with an hour lunch (7:30-6:30). "
good,"A typical day starts at 8AM by logging into our workforce application on the company iPhone. Throughout the day you go to jobs assigned to you, fix/install their services and complete the job, then move on to the next job. Management claims that you HAVE to take a 1-hr lunch, however, sometimes you have to work through lunch to make appointment windows (only about 5% of the time)."
good,"Responsible for support of all telecommunication services for Comcast customers.  Also best fitting them into the right plan to fit their individual needs. "
good,"Excellent benefits and pay (if you meet at least minimum goals), especially without a college degree."
good,"There is a 3:30 pm production meeting, ideas are discussed for the 6:00 pm show.  After a half-hour sports news show, the next meeting is 7:00 pm to discuss what should be in 10:00 pm show.  Hardest part of the job is getting idea across or getting the proper access to let those ideas develop.  Most enjoyable part of the job is you are covering sports"
good,"Decent company to work for. The main thing is that you get pretty good perks.  Stock buying, free cable, decent 401k are the real gems here."
good,"At work at 730  am pick up my van and look at my route on computer   "
good,"inbound/outbound calls, set up payment plans and processed credit card and check payments"
good,A typical workday was very busy handling upset customers that did not have any services working. My day would be answering escalation calls and setting up trouble house calls or trouble shooting with the customer over the telephone. I enjoyed helping my team mates acquire good customer service skills and handling each call to the best of their ability. I advised my co workers that they must listen to the customers issues and allow them to vent.
good,Provide tech support to a high volume of inbound calls to customers for Voice and Internet services. Solve customer's problem in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job was when I could not get a tech to the customer's home within 24 hours.  I enjoyed the job because it was never boring.
good,"a typical day of work consisted of, logging in and reviewing jobs at hand, gathering equipment for the day, drive to each residence and perform professional installations. The management was very understanding and were able to answer any questions. All of my co-workers were very knowledgeable of our products and the troubleshooting processes."
good,"Inbound sales and customer account management. Answering the calls of new and existing customers providing the most superior quality of customer service I could. Troubleshooting and resolving account issues in the most amicable way possible. I worked in a work environment that made my co-workers into my family. We learned to depend on each other for various situations. The customers though they may be difficult at times, they do provide you with a day full of adventures and challenges."
good,"I don't normally mind having to work on the phones, but considering that people are usually calling you very upset and yelling at you all day was mentally draining. The commission was very good and my supervisor was awesome, but it's a very high turn over job."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of arriving to unpack, stack, and prep new cable box material, converse with employees and management on daily tasks, and load computer work station for diagnostics. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting unknown tech problems. "
good,"Hated every minute of it, the employees there were great but the management had no clue what they're were doing half the time. Spent 7 years working there only because of the great benefits"
good,"productive and fun workplace .... handled all types of customers in all types of settings. calm to irate (busy call center, the hardest part of the job busy busy busy most enjoyable part pay/commission and loved my coworkers"
good,"supervisors were very helpful and fun co workers, but job very challenging. have to keep up with technology. technology moved to fast for me"
good,"On a typical day I will go to multiple customers homes to fix cable, internet, phone, or home alarm problems they may have. I also install all of the products that Comcast offers."
good,"This has been a very unique experience, it has helped me at every level professional and personal. It's a very challenging and rewarding field. Through my experience I have learned a new respect for this profession."
good,"I enjoyed working at Comcast, it was a great experience for me and I got the chance to learn a lot."
good,I have spent most of my life with Comcast and I have grown in ways that I can carry my skills into my future and it allows me to be a very contending candidate in various jobs.
good,"I would find a new community to solicit for business.  I would present each business owner with a brief introductory of our product benefits and services.  I learned that first impressions are lasting impressions, build trust and a strong partnership with every client."
good,"there was no typical day at work, work changed every day. It was fast paced and very demanding. I enjoyed it a lot."
good,Good work days self controled.  Some days your off super early some days super late.
good,Glad to have had the opportunity to work for a company as established as Comcast. I enjoyed my tenure there and would recommend it as a great job for an aspiring Technician.
good,"Great benefits and perks, but there are far too many thing that they judge the technicians on that are outside of the technicians control. Also advancement is nearly nonexistant after the first 1-2 years."
good,"The company was amazing to work for. I was, however, a contracted employee through a staffing agency. I worked with Comcast for almost four years before they had to end my contract due to lack of resources. I thoroughly enjoyed the work that I completed there and would recommend the company to anyone looking for employment. The hardest part of the job was knowing that at any moment my contract could end and I could be out of a job but while I was there, I was a valuable part of a team. They never treated me any different than if I were an actual ""in-house"" employee."
good,"Good pay, do well with a good evaluation of your review for call handle time, sales and 1st call resolution and pick your shift in a 24 hour environment"
good,Being door to door sales it was a great learning experience.
good,"Comcast has grown significantly over the years but one of the knocks on the organization is the constant state of reorganization that seems to impact employees tenure, career progresssion and job stability."
good,a great place to work!!! Training a variety of technical levels within the company. From New-hire to network 5 technical levels
good,Comcast has a great market and many databases to be managed. It was a privilege working there.
good,"This position was the coolest job I've ever worked. Working at  Comcast Corporation, is where I was rewarded for my hard work."
good,"I am working on the RDK emulator for the RDK stack - 1.3"
good,Fair company to work for only time things became challenging was when irate customers call in because once again their services aren't work.
good,"Terrific group of team players."
good,Providing technical support to Comcast customer's using Comcast Digital Voice services.
good,enjoyed working with customers and being challenged to work in the field 
good,A typical day at work was productive and fun. my co-workers are all professional with a good sense of humor.  The most enjoyable part of  the job is knowing that you helped a customer  get through a difficult task.
good,You will have the ability to learn a great deal and are taught to think outside the box.
good,I enjoyed working in dispatch but this department no longer exist.  All employees were let go and the job is now farmed out to Comcast in Michigan.  I left many years before this but had many friends that worked there at that time.
good,"Progressive company not a dull moment. I work for Comcast form 1999 till 2007. I was a part of transition from Intermedia to Comcast. I think Intermedia had lots more bonuses and promotions and a better relationship with the movies networks then Comcast, and that made it fun me to come to work."
good,"This is certainly not the job for everyone, but if you think that you have the ability to push yourself to succeed and are a very self-motivated individual, then this may be the right job.  Direct sales is door to door sales primarily.  You will knock in all weather patterns, in all neighborhoods day and into the night.  There won't be a manager breathing over your back, but Comcast does take precautions to know where and when their sales reps are in the field.  The quota numbers are not extreme by any means.  They are completely achievable and they do have a nice ramp up program, but this is by no means an easy job.  You will encounter all types of people in all different situations.  There was a time when it was ok to walk up to a persons door to sell products.  These days however, there are a lot of people that are not comfortable with door to door sales, and you will encounter these people on a regular basis.  Mental toughness, positive attitude, and self-motivation are all going to be huge factors for success.  This isn't likely to be your favorite job ever, but you will be financially rewarded for your time and your drive."
good,"A very professional enviornment to work in, w/ great managers who kept you on your toes."
good,To call existing clients to upgrade their services in the home and or business .I learned how to use a high volume of productivity to keep sales numbers above quota. The most difficult part of this job is selling to people who already have service so they may not be in the market to purchase and produces. The most enjoyable part of the job is the close of the sale . I makes me feel good to sale products t people who may not have wanted something but i was able to help them find value in a upgrade. 
good,"Working & being successful as a Sales Rep with Comcast Business hinges on a person's activity level.  Moderate activity equals moderate compensation, but high activity equals big pay days.  It was here where I learned the activity mantra, & after putting it into practice, resulted in high levels of success & compensation within only a short period of time."
good,A typical day at comcast is handling about 40-63 customers a day with internet and dailtone issues while also trying to upgrade the customer services. What i have learned is i am very good at troubleshooting over the phone with any age group of people and upgrading there service to better fit there needs. My co-workers love my knowledge of support for how to fix the customer issues and how to enter orders in the systems. Honestly there's noting hard about the job at all cause my back ground is computer networking. The most enjoyable part about my job is hearing the customer say ( Miracle u are a Miracle cause i have been dealing with this issue for weeks and u fixed it in five minutes. Thank u so much and i will like to tell somebody how wonderful you are at your job).  
good,"I really enjoyed Comcast, and I would actually go back if I had to. Management was pretty good, and they pushed you to reach your potential. I do not like the disorganization that came along with us combining with the other regional  call centers. They wanted us to become one, which was great, but it was very crazy during that time. The pay was pretty good, because you get quarterly bonuses, plus commission. You are expected to take 8 calls per hour, and at least 2.5% sales on those calls. If you fall short they give you plenty of opportunity, so don't get discouraged. They will work with you. I rarely made 8 calls, but I had good sales. So, nice place, I miss it somewhat, but it is VERY hard to grow, or advance. Example, If you start in customer service, you probably will remain in customer service.  "
good,Nice place to work could be paid a lite more the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction
good,Comcast a good company to work for. A typical day at Comcast would start with logging on to the computer so we can keep track of our jobs and making sure customers receive what they ordered. Customer service is key in my position making sure the customer is truly satisfied. The management at Comcast is ok due to the fact that escalated issues are not dealt with timely. I have learned many sales skills and organizational skills at my time at Comcast. The most difficult part of the job would be the fact that after a customer is sold we have no control whether a sale gets installed or not. Overall the job is very exciting and there is a lot of interaction with people face to face and over the phone.
good,"Fantastic benefits. Great company overall. Not for the faint at heart, must be driven and committed. Very structured. Management can be very direct and have very high expectations. Very goal driven and competitive environment. Must be about the numbers, they are driving force."
good,Comcast is a good place to work but there is no room for advancement.
good,"Overall Comcast was a great company to work for. The supervisors and mangers were always available to help you succeed and grow. The hardest part of the job was dealing with personal attacks from customers, although if they were using foul language we were allowed to warn them, and if they did not stop, we could disconnect the call. The most enjoyable part to me was helping the customers and my peers resolve their issues."
good,This job has a lot of opportunity for advancement in the company. The most enjoyable part about the job is talking with all of the different ethnicities of people you can meet through the call center business. The hardest part of the job is learning to balance the job as well as other things going on in your life.
good,"its overall not a bad place to work. As long as you are content with staying at the same paygrade the whole time you are there. There is no opportunity for advancement but the job pays decent, the benefits are great, and overall is a fun place to work"
good,Boot up my computer make sure my phone is working. Dial into the system and start collecting overdue payments.
good,"Comcast is a HUGE corporation. Their training was comprehensive and thorough. It's a standard hectic call center. No matter how much customers complain about Comcast or their perceived issues, it's a great product and a great service and an excellent company to work for. Employees are given a lot of tools to help achieve the company's goals of customer satisfaction. Support within the company is good, but due to volume sometimes could be difficult to get quickly. Overall a good company to work for and allows call center employees a lot of opportunities to bring their own spin and personalities to the customer service experience."
good,"I'm a former twenty year employee of the Federal Reserve Bank here in Philadelphia, Pa. working in check operations in various capacities. Having the chance to be hired by Comcast was the start of another career in Collections and more heavily involved in Customer Service. The training I received was mostly sitting and listening to calls but mostly I developed my own style and verbage with customers. Comcast also gave me an opportunity to use my Bachelors of Business Administration in a entry level capacity."
good,"This was a great place to work. The free cable, internet, and phone service was nice."
good,"Good company to work for however, as a communication company the message is confusing. The reps have a 9 minute talk time but sometimes have to deal with customers who know very little about trouble shooting and this takes up more time."
good,If you are looking for great commission and a positive environment this is an awesome place to work.
good,I recieve my route every morning and thats when I find out what kind of jobs I have that day. Then I pick up the proper equipment for each job. I then load my truck and im off into a area where i will work. I work alone every day and that can be the hardest part of my job but I dont mind it. Iam in contact with my managers if there was a problem at a home or if they want me to pick up work(another job)
good,My typical day at work was pretty busy and enjoyable.
good,"Answering calls from new and exsiting customers reguarding thier accounts. I learned to listen to what a person is not saying to better assess thier needs.Working with a variety of people, helped me to better understand diffrent cultures. That and the bonuses were the best feature for me. The hardest part was working the weekends and not being able to have family time."
good,Good experience for a part time job. Everyone was really nice and flexible.
good,Must be able to multitask on a team with little supervision.
good,The sales job itself was one of the best!
good,A typical day at work would consist of logging into the phone where customer were always waiting to be assisted. Wether it was for tech support or just a simple billing calls Every call different from the last and still requiring your full undivided attention.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work! Fun and challenging, great employee and leadership. Kitchen and ping pone table as well as hockey."
good,Very fasted paced. Must be able to handle irate customers. Sales goals extremely important.
good,"Great company to work for. Benefits and perks. Typical day is loggin in. Checking email. Exchnaging equipmnet, sales, return equipment, issue billing and also reaching quoatas per month"
good,"I assist customers with all service issues. Assist technicians in the field with line problems, porting problems, equipment problems, work orders that needs to be revised. I assist with various escalations and corporate escalations."
good,"I have worked at Comcast for 13 years. It is a big company, and your experience will vary greatly depending on the specific area you work in."
good,An enjoyable environment. The management team is fair and hard working. A typical day is being on the call center 7 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of the job are the contest and rewards.
good,good company benefits
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. You have to buckle in and enjoy the ride because they are always striving to keep their products up to date and satisfy their customers with excellent service. Therefore, change happens fast! Great team atmosphere, unbeatable benefits and lots of opportunity for growth."
good,The company has a lot of options for acquiring new skills and career advancement.
good,"Great company to work for overall. Great benefits, excellent pay and great people to work with."
good,"It was great place to work, lt had lots of room for advancement, great people and management."
good,"I enjoyed a day at Comcast with great co-workers! A typical work day would include assisting incoming calls from customers for computer support. I attended many focus groups, developed best practices, and assisted in coordinating events for the Company for their employees."
good,Fast paced ever changing environment. Great place to be recognized for hard work. Very diverse environment. Work life balance recently became challenging.
good,as for typical day at work there isnt such a thing except everyday you will deal with different people ... same as with most places some managers are better than others to work for but overall management is good to work with and the co-workers make the day go by faster. the hardest part of the job truly is the red tape and unessecary rules... the most enjoyable thing is definatly the ability to work hard and fix problems either on your own or in a small team.
good,"A typical day at Comcast includes logging in the computer and the automatic dialer by 10am. As I start recieving calls I attempt to upsale existing customers by offering home phone and internet services. I have learned differnt things about myself through telesales. As a sales person and utilizing my rebuttaling techniques I completed various sales throughout the day. My co workers were friendly and willing to assist anyone who may have needed help on a call. The hardest part of my job was convincing elderly customers to buy into out promotions. Alot of time, they usually have a phone service through another company and are comfortable with it. The most enjoyable part was the recognition for over achieving sales goals for the month."
good,Was a great opportunity but I feel it ended to soon without an opportunity to redeem myself from one mistake
good,"Metrics, metrics, metrics..."
good,Comcast was fun to work at. The people was nice and Free Cable is always a plus. This Job was most challenging because we were dry calling and some of the customer was very angry all the time
good,"A typical day at work involved over the phone contact with customers to assist billing questions and video repair issues. There were always something new to learn because mostly every customer had different questions and issues. You have to have the ability to become accustom to change as processes/procedures, troubleshooting techniques, promotions and product are always changing at Comcast. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with the customers and being able to fix there issues and making there day a better day after providing effective/beneficial customer service."
good,"Working for Comcast is great! Unfortunately I am only a temporary employee, and my assignment will end soon."
good,"Although the company locally is going through a realignment, there are many opportunities to advance or see the company from a totally different perspective. They are striving to better understand their employee and encourage engagement in the product , service and company."
good,I enjoyed working with management and coworkers to complete my daily tasks assigned
good,"Followed up with customers, called new prospects. Improved people and communications skills. Team got stronger during the time we did not have a manager/supervisor -learned to depend on each other more and become self starters."
good,Handling customer complaints and solving billing issues.
good,Comcast provides excellent customer service and a great work enviroment. Managment should be a little more orginized though.
good,Being that Comcast was a 24 hour call center there was times I had to switch shifts from working days to working at night to get the days off I needed at the time.
good,comcast is a good place to work as every comes with it's challenges and it builds your experience. I keep busy all through the day and this helped shape my career.
good,The job was a a big call center. My hours were from 2:30 to 11:00
good,"Typically, just take calls, and assist subscribers with any technical support problems they may have with their internet service. I learned a great deal about how Internet services work, as well as, how to correct any problems that are encountered. My management was a mixed bag. My supervisor worked closely with me, and my trainer and I formed a solid relationship. Other than that, most supervisors gave the impression that they didn't care too much about you. I enjoyed the majority of my co-workers, though we went through training together. Others, simply weren't interested in socializing, which is fine. The hardest part of the job was being unable to show others how to fix things physically. Sometimes, it was difficult to give instruction to certain individuals. I enjoyed helping my subscribers, and getting their services up and running was always a very good feeling."
good,"Great pay and benefits, but the shift work can be time consuming."
good,"Many opportunities to move up and nice people to work with. Good team leaders, always educating and updating about new products and services."
good,"Answering incoming calls from customers and getting them setup with the right bundle package for there family. I learned how to ask probing question in order to get them setup with the correct bundle package which would be either tv cable, internet, phone, or home security. Management was ok. My co-worker were very nice and very helful as well. Trying to get people to buy the home phone service because everyone had a cell phone and really didn't want the home phone. Being able to take care of the customers needs and give great customer service"

good,"Friendly staff and great building to work in, new cafeteria and gym on site to make work/life more convenient."
good,"Focuses on promoting the hard working, interested individuals and offers great benefits"
good,Comcast service centers have an enviroment of being very fast paced. While all their employee perform at their highest abilities the high ups do not recognize their employees hard work
good,This was a bennificial work expetience in the way of learning a career skill that was 90% on the job training. My experience in this possition allowed me to grow as a proffetional and a responsable employee.
good,same thing you'd hear about any other fortune 50 company honestly. Corporate greed wreaks around this place. But store managers are normally fun and make your day to day not as horrible as it really is.
good,A good place to work.  Other employees/team members make it more enjoyable.  They have great benefits and fair pay. There are a lot of metrics to reach for advancement
good,"I love working for comcast... but expect as the salary grow, the job gets downsize. Usually most people end up getting laid off base on salary. that is very disappointing."
good,"Good environment that grows daily, and  creating a challenging task to keep you motivated. This encouragement and felt by management who encourage to ideas and innovation to help you the best you can be."
good,"If you work hard and get the job complete Successfully and on time, you will be rewarded. However at times, you won’t  have great home / work balance when trying to complete a project on time"
good,"A typical day at work starts at around 6:30am where we log into our customer fulfillment app to see our first job."
good,The culture at Comcast really emphasises the collaboration between the various departments. Work-life balance greatly varies by department. Overall it is a good company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed my job at comcast once I was able to reach my monthly goals. I wish I had a better understanding of the point system, I would definitely still be there had it not been for that."
good,"Comcast was an amazing place to work. It had great benefits, great culture and  plenty of room for advancement If you're willing to put in the time and hard work"
good,"I set up new customers with comcast services, help existing customers understand billing, processed payments. The hardest part of the job was dealing with and satisfying upset customers."
good,"If you like a job were you don't have a manager on your back and love to work. This is the job for you, travel around city and suburbs communicating with people from all different walks of life.  I loved the experience!"
good,"I've been working for comcast for over a year now.  The company is very flexible.  In the first year I was able to work from home.  Right now I'm going for leadership training.  It's a tough job, you deal with a lot of disgruntled customers.  What I enjoy most is working from home and getting a good amount of time off.  The part that I don't like is its metric driven.  That can be difficult, because your scores can vary if your supervisor doesn't like you."
good,Typical day at work consists of non-stop customer service with a smile and positive attitude.  Resolving issues of customers and lending advice on how to maximize their services.
good,"Be confident, fun, professional, no matter what always be professional with customers, and co-workers and always says  the truth, and be patient customers like attention."
good,"The management team is wonderful, they really care for your success and well being. Overall it's a great company to work for. In this position, you never really get time off but the company makes sure to commend hard work. The job can be stressful from time to time."
good,Good company with excellent benefits.  Nice to work with people who actually care about their performance.  You can expect to be challenged depending on what department you work in.
good,"Advancement for ghose with an interest in the field, way to complex for so.eone mot familiar. I find the micro management very annoying, one was treated like a kindergarten kid."
good,"Great leadership, good opportunity for growth, and a desire to want to learn will all help the career path that you choose. Be kind to other employees and they will help guide you on a path to success."
good,its a good place to work especially if your fresh out of school you can grow with the business and there are a lot of areas of opportunity. I would recommend
good,"This job will test you over and over again. In patients mostly, but everyday you keep learning something new everyday. Its a tough work environment due to the load of customers that need attention, patients is key, and knowing the system well is very important. The job constantly changes and being able to adapt to the new changes is highly important."
good,"I learned a lot working at Comcast. The initial training was excellent, the supervisors were supportive, and my commission was consistently $3-5K/month (top twentieth percentile). Tuition Reimbursement is $5750/yr for any accredited undergraduate studies and almost $8k/yr for any graduate studies (no approved majors list since 2018). Fully paid 12 weeks parental leave for primary caregivers (mom or dad)."
good,"The stress came from the targets, which I felt put too much definition on you as a person. Otherwise, the environment could be quite good. If you were accepted as a person it was great. If the numbers/goals drew too much focus, not so much."
good,Comcast takes very good care of you. I just feel like I am stuck in a position that I'd like to move out of. That is the only reason I'm looking at leaving.
good,"Very structured work environment. Performance, merit increases, promotions are metric based. Once you make it through a year, more opportunities are available."
good,"Full gym with locker room available.  Fun atmosphere, quarterly incentive bonuses for non- commission employees based on the companies overall performance,"
good,"Very good company, hours can be difficult for families. Working past normal hours. Working out in the weather most of the year. Good benefits. Pay is alright"

good,"I have worked with comcast for 2+ years. It's a great place to work and learn stuff. I joined as a fresher, I got all the support from the team leads, Managers. Compensation completely depends on the role and responsibilities of the job you're applying to."
good,good place to work with room for advancement u will work in all the elements u are given a company vehicle to take home and upkeep and maintain meeting new people everyday
good,"Fast pace meet new people everyday, Driving all over the City, from County to County, everyday is was A great Job, as a leader I had to teach train the new guys how to do the job in a timely manor."
good,pay is pretty good for the field. paid 3 months training in the beginning. 4 10 hour work days but that doesnt mean you are working 10hr you could be working 10-13 hour days
good,"Great environment a lot of pressure for sales goals, work schedules 😩😩😩 sucks so if you have small children not the place for you!!! Don’t really have control of schedules."
good,"Prepared for to be a part of a close knit, and diverse team. This is a dynamic workforce comprised of goal oriented people. Comcast is fun, exciting, and ever changing."
good,"Typical work day would include: handling customers accounts regarding escalations, billing, discounts, starting and disconnecting accounts, xfinity mobile. The work culture was good and had a lot of diversity which opened up my mind set with the different types of customers we would get in the store. Management was poor, they often liked to push people out of the store and didn't support the team. There was miscommunication daily with management and the team, but the team worked together to problem solve issues. Management was not very professional and often discussed personal issues with reps with other team members, HR department was often diligent about handling the issues."
good,I love my job. I would not trade it for nothing! There are many nice incentives that the company has that will help motivate you to do your best. Again I love this job!
good,This is a great place to work if you have a flexibility. Free snacks at times. They do work with you as much as possible. Your numbers mean EVERYTHING! If you do come to give 110% don’t expect to grow.
good,"This company allows for growth with many available shifts. There are stressful parts of the job, and it is extremely quick-paced. For individuals who don't like much down time and are good with people, this is the job for you."
good,"Not just installing cable and internet. This includes carrying and climbing ladders, crawling through attics and crawl spaces, lots of troubleshooting and physical work. Great benefits, but lower pay for what it is. Also insurance is high because of risk factor."
good,The job was very high demanding starting from 6-8.Whenever we were present at a job site we couldn't leave till it was finished and cleaned up. The job was really difficult once you had to go in the attic. the heat combined with sometimes scattered cables made this job physically and mentally demanding.
good,Great training offered and benefits. Management could be nicer and more understanding with newer employees. every thing else with the company is pretty decent and fair.
good,I'm a dedicated employee and enjoy my job...The day to day operation leads you to interact with team members on a regular to meet deadlines.  I'm a better team player than I was when I first started working at Comcast.
good,Company is finally catching up to some overdue reorganization issues. I'd expect a lot of changes over the next few years. Great place to apply if you are just getting out of college.
good,Management needs to improve but it's a good place to work. You'll have to do your best if you want to continue to work here since they are very strict with call flow and making upsales
good,"Handeling and troubleshooting calls each day,via telephone.  Perform multi task while on phones. Logging info into computer for company record keeping .  Great management, workplace culture ,  Hardest part, very stressful with company deadlines to meet company  numbers on a weekly / monthly  basic."
good,"I enjoy working here. There is a lot of room for growth. The location is nice. Everyday is a new experience. There are great co-workers, who are very helpful there."
good,"A nice career just things change every day. you work with little to no supervision, everyone is kind and friendly and there is a great open door policy"
good,"Most Diverse , its great company to work provide full benefits to employee , helps to maintain  work life balance  ,provides assistance to develop career  ."
good,"My position in the retention department required the ability to reinforce the benefits or comcast's products, saving customers from switching providers as well as selling or reselling the price and service points. While working there my skill level with sales and overall communication was definitely increased. It was a call center environment which was always busy."
good,Direct supervisor had his own way of management which did not match other supervisors of the same job. Made it difficult and more stressful than it should have been.
good,"Comcast is a dynamic place to work. The technology & benefits are amazing. Depending on the department that you work for, your work/life balance varies. Working the Retail Space is a challenge but it is rewarding as well. Overall a great place to start a career."
good,Best sales division I have ever seen. Management changed alot in the Door to Door division but well compensated. I would definitely work there again..
good,Comcast pays well and has good benefits. Working in the call center there is a lot of time on phones and sitting. Some management could be better and their values.
good,"I did enjoy my 6 years at Comcast but it got to a point were I couldn't advance any more from a level 4 agent and with me seating down for long periods of time, it took a toll on my body plus a bad car accident force me out of employment after the disability period ended. It was very stressful and was affecting my health otherwise I still be there ."
good,Great place to work if you are single or like long hours as well as the stresses of the micro managed metrics. Great pay and benefits along with free cable and internet.
good,Working at COMCAST was very challenging and rewarding while working with customers on the phone can be challenging at times depending of the circumstances if their but was allowing me to grow all the time.
good,Seeks to provide outstanding customer service to all customers.  Encourages employees to provide feedback regarding ways to improve customer and employee experiences.
good,Comcast Spotlight hires from within first and foremost. They are constantly restructuring their employee roles so it's important to make yourself indispensable. Management and supervisors encourage employee growth and understand work life balance.  All about who you know here.
good,Family work balance good many perks. Take home company vehicle. Free gym. Travel opportunities for family . independent work and community involvement not stuck in an office all day. Good pay and room for advancement.
good,"Excellent discounts and health coverage but lack of career advancement and fair pay for the diverse amount of work is drastically underpaid. My supervisor was amazing great people to work with, however upper management is very disconnected from frontline workers"
good,You must be tech savvy and not afraid of heights. Don’t get frustrated with all the services you have to learn your fellow team members will help. Stay positive and you must be a people person
good,good place to work . teaches you how to manage your life . and any skill set you lack they teach you . you begin to realize you can do things for your self . self confidence is what i got out of Comcast .
good,"There are lots of opportunities to advance to the manager level, but after that, if you don't have a MBA, CPA, or other credentials, the company won't even give you interviews for director or above positions.  Management can be a bit ""elitist"" in that regards.  "
good,"This is a sales position. Be prepared to sale products and services ti every customer on every call. If you can so this you will do well."
good,Fast paced environment based on sales and learned a lot through training and self education about the company structure and workplace environment was good.
good,"It’s a good place to work, stressful and high paced but friendly people. .............................................................….................."
good,I enjoyed my time at Comcast. Spent a lot of time outdoors and meeting new people. I learned many of the skills I have today while employed with Comcast.
good,Comcast is a great place to work and is constantly changing and evolving.  Being on the Spotlight side we get to bring solutions to local businesses and help drive customers to them.  People are great and it is a rewarding career.
good,"Various assignments, with instruction or any update changes are accessible. I have adapt to new programs and products to assist in all assignments as needed. Teamwork"
good,I learned a lot about how the company works while there. All of the management I met there were nice and knew about the departments there were running. Most of them worked their way up or have been with the company for years so that is a positive.
good,"- Structured schedule "
good,"Analyzed consumer accounts and implemented necessary products to meet customer needs . Communicated and solved customer billing issues .Cash handling .Reconciled daily deposit sheets, archived balance sheets, Cross-trained and provided backup for other customer service representatives when needed. Worked with direct chain of command in order to take on some business related tasks. Mentored 4 new hires in order to best prepare new teammates for intended roll. Learning new methods on improving team morale / metrics every day"
good,Comcast as an overall company is an great place to work.It's a great company to get customer service and troubleshooting experience. You just need to find the department that best your personality and skill level.
good,"The company tends to be on the bleeding edge of technology, giving persistent opportunities new things. Benefits are great. Culture at times, tends to be challenge at times."
good,"Great place to work always concerned about their employees. Comcast offer many leadership courses. I was able to take online software courses paid by Comcast such as Excel, PowerPoint. I was given an expense card to purchase supplies for sales team as well as managed salesman's assigned routes. I enjoyed supporting the teams the most."
good,Worked at the company may years.  To continue my career I would need to move to another state for advancement.  Company offers great benefits and pays well over the years.
good,"It may not be for everybody, but i will say there is never a dull moment working with comcast.  All companies have ups and downs but mostly positive experiences for me."
good,I am very grateful for the opportunity to work at Comcast. I have learned a lot regarding RF signals and what affects them.  Also learn the different cable types and which ones to use depending on the environment.
good,"Good working environment good scheduling based on location assigned pay definitely needs to increase and be on par with AT&T, they do same job but get paid better"
good,"Aside from medical/personal issues I had during my time of employment, I absolutely enjoyed the atmosphere. Management/supervisors are very involved with advancement at Comcast."
good,"I was excited for trying something new as far as sales go. I have never had a job where I was assigned a sale goal to maintain my job so this was a challenge for me. The company offers many great benefits, they match your 401k contributions and provide ample pto"
good,"Great job, very challenging work in the beginning. The issue is instead of dealing with the issues that plagued our department by a person by person evaluation, they closed the whole department. Throw out a lot of the good with the few bad."
good,Need to stay on yours toes easy to fall behind if you don’t adapt.  New products always introduced.  Policy and procedure change constantly.  Must stay focused.
good,Comcast is not actually a bad place to work.  Benefits and pay are competitive.  They have paid for training and management is understanding of work/life balance.
good,Whether you choose to stay in the company and work your way up or use your experience and move on to another company starting with Comcast will put you on a great path to succeed.
good,"Pay and benefits are the best thing about Comcast. Management is not the worst, however, You are pushed to do a lot in a short amount of time sometimes. There are windows for work to be done and sometimes those windows do not include all the possible factors that take place in the work environment."
good,"The benefits are amazing. It is hard for me to find another company that can come close to match their medical, 401K and time off benefits."
good,"The following are the main highlights for work environment at Comcast:"
good,"I liked working for this company, they had a lot of incentives and benefits to keep us interested in working but in addition, had a lot of challenges as well in offering the best support to disgruntled customers"
good,My department was typically the first to initiate change and in turn was expected to accept changes in responsibilities short of notice. Can be fun and relaxed. People are very friendly.
good,"I really loved working for Comcast, it was very friendly and fast paced which for some can be hard if your not used to change for me though it works because I catch on quick. The people are amazing including the managers and I was learning something new every day. The benefits are out of this world and I hated the fact that I had to leave but due to safety reason for my children and I unfortunately had to make that move. I was also going through mental health issues as well as my son having a very rare disease that got a lot worse, which required my full attention and care. Overall I loved to make the customers happy and that they all wanted my personal extension."
good,Great company to work for.  Several managerial changes and H.R. was too involved in daily operations.  Very stressful if quotas are not being met daily
good,good  place and very busy great opportunities  and customer focused  employee driven - too many changes with management great products for customers to choose
good,"I truly have nothing negative to say about Comcast.  I had a blast working for them.  The only reason I had to leave was due to a family issue I had to address.  The pay was reasonable, management was helpful and the culture was always fun."
good,Typical day is you coming in signing into your phone preparing for the current promotions of the day. Hardest part of the job is selecting the right bundles because if you don't you don't get paid for that order which isn't fair at all.
good,Was a great place to work. Had strongly supportive and cohesive teams. The hardest part of the job was the rotating schedules and strict PTO usage guidelines.
good,Comcast is a decent place to work especially if you are good with Retention service they do pay decent with the commission however it could more... but
good,Great place to work and awesome culture. I would recommend working for Comcast to my peers. Customer experience is key how ever sometimes lost with higher leadership.
good,Good opportunity to learn new skills comcast promotes and enviorment that encourges you to want to learn new things and they have a fun way of teaching you these new task
good,"Comcast can be a wonderful place to work due to the people. Being a top 50 fortune company, they are always looking for ways to remain competitive and therefore always looking to enhance current services or come up with new ones. This means that things are often changing which is one of the things I truly enjoyed!"
good,"Lots of training and the benefits are great.  Obviously not a job for the faint of heart since not all customers are warm and friendly.  But if you can block out the bad, the good ones will out way."
good,Great company to work for. Retention is a lot stressful when trying to meet the metrics and customers verbal and emotional abuse you from time to time. I would recommend any other department over retention. Retention pays better though and has more perks
good,I encoded TV ads and uploaded them on to Comcast's network. I also monitored all the local zones making sure there was no issues with the ads playing.
good,it was overall a good job. But as with any job there were pros and cons. A lot more pros than cons....................................................
good,Great place to work . The technician position is very challenging and can make you question your choice of job. At the end of the day its worth the trouble. You get lots of benefits.
good,"I love my job! I love my peers! I love the products we offer! I like my leadership! I do not like the pay. I have worked very hard for this company and asked for a raise due to cost of living in Colorado and they told me no because we are just in a sticker shock. It has been this way for at least 3 years now and I can barely afford a 2 bedroom apartment for my family of 4 with rent being $1,700.00 per month. When explaining this to the powers that be with a business plan backed by numbers they scoffed at me and didn't hear it. A fortune 50 company can afford a cost of living raise to its 9 trainers living in Colorado and won't even hear an argument for a raise."
good,"This department started  new, and with in the first year I was promoted to team lead then the Commercial Business for Business stated and promoted, We started out with 13 people and now were 160 strong. We have tried several formats over the past five years and were competing with two out side vendors as a new branch in Florida and were going strong. I was a pleasure to be with this company to watch them grow, but my ultimate satisfactions has honestly been the amazing customers who I've been able to help make life less stressful. That I'll miss."
good,The supervisor position is a very demanding and high stressful job. Management will keep you pushing your team for more with little to no let up. Work life balance is a true issue to maintain and juggle. Long hours and days. 10-14 hour days. This job can be great if the stress was less. Comcast benefits are great and maybe one of the greatest part of this job. After working for the company 10+ years you receive 4 weeks paid vacation time off.
good,Comcast gives the opportunity to be independent while at work at lets you use your own leadership skills. There is always ways to increase pay and to increase your position in the company.
good,The company as a whole is amazing they just have poor choice of management. It would be nice if the management team actually took the time out to try to solve an issue instead of telling employees if they don’t like it they can leave.
good,Comcast can be a great place to work. Great benefits right away which is awesome. Extensive training about 3 months worth  managers vary either really nice and professional or ridiculous. hardest part of your job is keeping your cool because Comcast customers are intense.
good,"Working for Comcast for the past 2 years, I have learned and gained a lot of experienced working in a team environment.  Overall, working in my current job is very relaxing and sometimes stressful.  The people I work with, however, are great.  Much like a family environment here and that is why I love coming to work."
good,"Excellent employees The company offers great benefits such as health care, 401(k), cable, Internet, phone service, cell phone service. Also paid time off."
good,"At the time of my employment, the workload was too high for the number of people staffing the department.  The workplace culture was open and enjoyable."
good,"I have been a Comcast Employee for many years and have seen the Company grow in their Product development and their Technological advances."
good,"Great benefits, some of the best in the industry. Some products are launched early to compete in the market, but pricing structures and customer knowledge are thee yet."
good,A typical day at work includes logging into your phone at the designated time. You're given 10 minutes to access your tools and be available to take your first call. You are at your desk 6.5 hours taking inbound calls. I've learned you must stay focus and multi-task on each call to be productive. Management is willing to listen to ways to improve the Customer experience. The Culture is inclusive. The hardest part of the job is not taking angry calls personally. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we're in meeting where ideals are shared but more importantly assisting Customer with their concerns.
good,"Good job if you like a desk, office environment with busy phones and dealing with people and solving technical issues. Can get stressful but if you have temperament for high volume customer service work it can be rewarding."
good,It’s alright. The management could be a little better. Seems to be an issue where the company takes up for the customer more than they do for their own employees
good,A typical day at Comcast Spotlight was to manage client accounts for advertising on Cable TV.  I have learned a great deal about the Sales/Advertising business as well as an introduction to Marketing.
good,"Xfinity sales associate"
good,Benefits are good. Great place to work with opportunities to advance. Management is supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and making a difference.
good,This job can be very competitive and fast paced however they train each new tech coming in giving them a great opportunity to excel.  Their benefit package is very well set up with all the premium benefits that are available
good,Although very stressful; if you can talk to people this is the job for you. great pay and benefits. Always room to improve and advance your career. Recommended!
good,"A typical workday is fast paced, hard work, and challenging. Ive learned time management, tech support and installation, management could be better but ive seen Supervisors give techs the support they need, hardest part of job is having multiple jobs to handle at once with little support, the best part of job is the tech advances we enjoy before customers."
good,"It was a good place to work, received lots of benefits working for this company, good bonuses, management for the most part was fair and easy to get a long with"
good,"Very competitive environment, if you don't watch your sales another representative might steal your sale from you and nothing gets done about it by management even though they know it happens on a daily basis."
good,Great company. A lot of folks have been here for decades. The benefits are great. They are working hard to improve customer satisfaction and employee moral.
good,"Great introduction to sales if you're ready to expand job career options like I was. Very stressful because its sales, and sales is always stressful. Management can make it better, or make it worst. Depends on what type of supervisor you have. The environment is friendly competitive, their are monetary incentives on some days, pot lucks, GREAT give-a-ways, ect. Just have to make your 80%, or higher. None of these things will matter if you struggle to make sales point blank. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers to stay customers and not disconnect. Also, the team building process is outstanding. The culture is enjoyable."
good,Comcast is good place to work. The hourly wages are too low and commission metrics are not easy to meet. Management is good but the attendance policy needs work to make it fair and reasonable.
good,"This was a great role, I worked as a door to door sales associate. You could (prior to 2017 lay offs) Make a handsome amount of money selling the products. This was door to door so you are very much working outside soliciting business in all weather. I have worked in rain, and shine. This was a challenging position with a very stringent quota."
good,working there was okay worse part was dealing with people who didnt care about your feelings and did not care that were a person as they were other than that it was okay
good,The company takes good care of it's employees. Benefits and pay are good. lots of perks with the job. door to door sales allows you to be your own boss. you can choose to make more money depending on you. it's not an easy job because you will have people that will take anger to company out on you.
good,"I am currently still employed with Comcast, however i am looking to advance my career into a sales management role, with a little less time spent in the field and a little more time on the development of other sales professionals."
good,"Scheduled are fixed and difficult to change. Other than that, better than ok environment to work in. Success is dependent on the leadership of your team."
good,"Comcast invests in the training of their employee's. Need to be a little more diverse in the Sacramento Market, otherwise really nice place to work :)"
good,"I worked in this call center for almost 6 years. I love my co-workers and the pay is really good if you don't mind working hard. I wish there were more work-life balance but pto is good. New employees get 64 hours of vacation, 24 hours of floating holiday and 8 flexible days."
good,"While working at Comcast, some of my best experiences were my face to face interacting with customers and establishing trusted and key rapport in order to sell trusted products and services. Just knowing that the Xfinity brand and products were superior to our competitors was a breath of fresh air and working side by side with some of the best managers and other sales professionals really made my day. We worked hard in order to achieve our sales goals by building a strong team which strived to overachieve budget goals--which is always the case in Direct Sales. The benefits and salary was top notched. The hardest part of the job was knowing that I could not tell each and every customer that I helped that I was being laid off.  I relished helping and troubleshooting any concern that they had and I will also thoroughly miss enteracting with the technicians and my mentor. I miss them already."
good,"It was fun and stressful working at Comcast, they offer great benefits and pay also they offer many of activity to take part in on your breaks and lunch."
good,Great place to work. Anyone with a desire to grow and have fun helping customers this is a good place for you. If you get a chance to work for this company go for it
good,"Good working environment. You get to learned the business of telecommunications and you can have fun and make money."
good,"installing cable for customers was really exciting , when you can help a customer with the problems at hand,or when you get called to do a special project ."
good,"The people willing to learn will be successful."
good,"Full Life cycle recruiting- High Volume recruiting , responsible for recruiting  IT corporate senior level roles, sales and finance accounting roles  engineering"
good,"I worked for a third party vender hired by Comcast to set up home and businesses with cable internet and phone. Comcast taught me a lot in knowing how to install appointment for installations, taking account payments. Its a great place to lean about sales skills"
good,Good company to work for and employees worked as a team. High volume of calls and strict procedures and tons of training. Benefits and perks a big plus.
good,"I enjoyed working at Comcast but there's a glass ceiling. The pay was Ok or average and the benefits are good. But, I never felt there's a good chance for advancement for all employee's."
good,"Don't have anything to say, it's been a while since I've worked there and I honestly can't recall what it was like. I do know overall the company was great as far as the benefits."
good,"Comcast offers a top-notch benefots package. It includes Medical, Dental, Vision, 401k match (up to 4%), plus free cable and internet. The pay is not the best, but the benefits make up for it."
good,"A typical day is fast pace and interactive with all employees.   Performance is measured daily, weekly and monthly.  All employees have KPIs and are provided daily feedback on performance."
good,Young atmosphere with fast paced vibe. Pay was good for top performers. Pressure to close was tough to handle at times. Discounts on Comcast was nice.
good,"The general day-to-day work environment was pleasant. Most co-workers were easy to work with and usually productive. The workplace is clean and more or less efficient. In general, a good place to work."
good,"Work flow is pretty good. You run into some situations that are completely out your control, but other than that, great place to work. 4 day work weeks (10 hrs+/day) and 3 day weekends!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Comcast while I did. The managers and employees are nice and the pay is great. The working environment can get a little hostile though. The best part of the job is the people and the pay. The coworkers and managers are great and the pay is too. The worst part of the job is dealing with angry customers. You have to learn to not let what people say bother you, but after dealing with it every day for an extended period of time, it gets pretty irritating."
good,Direct Management was not great. Upper management was good. Pay was very good for entry level positions. Training was very good. Older techs there were cut throat.
good,Great place to work in but difficult to receive a career advancement.    Management is working hard to ensure that the workplace culture is a safe and friendly environment.
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for. I am in Door to door sales, and of course its not the easiest job, but if you do not hit your quota and reach 100% you do get your job threatened and they intend to put you on a ""plan "" and that means they give you two months to get it together and hit 100% or you are gone."
good,Great place to work...if you are ready to grind for sales.  Work life balance is great if you are a B2B Representative.  Your number speaks for itself.  If you produce you will have the opportunity for advancement.
good,It was definitely a learning experience.. I enjoyed the challenge and people that was in my immediate team friendly atosmophere.. Diversity room for growth
good,Company is focusing on better customer experience . There is still improvement needed due to lack of communication between departments . Hardest part of job is relying on other departments to do their jobs effectively in order for customer satisfaction
good,Loved the energy and passion for allowing new ideas. Change happened quickly and it's important to stay in communication with all involved. Great people to work with.
good,"At it's heart, Comcast is a bank looking to get returns on their investments in people, infrastructure, etc.  Got to prove your ROI as a contributor.  Lots of recognition if you do your job well.  Constant reorging!"
good,"Fun place to work. Business environment. Team environment.  Integrity, compassionate, professional and caring team. Customer service, technical, sales. Ongoing training."
good,"Comcast was a great place to start a career and work yourself up into management. The managers there are very relaxed and keep you informed. The workplace facilities were awesome. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers. The best part was the friendly competition to meet your metrics, they gave great prizes for doing so."
good,"Good company to work for , but choose your starting positions carefully. Telesales is not for everyone and if that's where you start you""re locked in for 1 year before you can move to another position."
good,its an ok place to work. the money is good with the bonus and there is room to grow but there is a process to growing with in the company. supervisors are ok. I was just on a bad team.
good,"I worked for COMCAST for 12 years, I started with a different cable Company than in turn was bough tout by Comcast.. My position as a Bilingual Customer Support front counter at Palm Beach Gardens Florida was outsourced overseas, forcing must of the senior reps like myself, from all the front counters from Vero Beach to the Florida Keys to get a salary reduction of approximately $16,000  per year."
good,"Great hours, great people, fun and productive work environment. Great experience for people of almost any age. The supervisiors are very knowledgable and down to earth people you can easily work with. The workplace environment is not only fun but very productive, and even thou we have quotas we have to make on a daily basis the work was not difficult at all, but the best part of the job hands down are the people that work there."
good,"The work culture is great and fast paced. The pay is industry standard but they have great perks with heavily discounted cable, phone and internet services."
good,"A typical day in a call center of course is answering inbound phone calls all day, which can seriously mentally exhaust you after a few years of doing it. The hardest part is the lack of advancement to branch out into different departments as they really like to hire out. That's really the only bad thing I can say because as a company they really do show you they care about their employees."
good,Comcast is definitely a good place to work if you do not mind being ignored by your supervisor .. the pay is good if you work for it as well how ever they do not treat everyone equally
good,They are very forward thinking and a good place to work. They are trying to use digital transformation to move beyond being a cable company. There are issues with layoffs each year as they are in a transition phase and not sure what they want their staffing model to look like.
good,In supply chin position there is no real chance for advancement. You can move into management but that is still a limited career advancement within the company.
good,"I love working for Comcast, I would just like something more fulfilling a position that gives me real purpose. Even though I am able to help people a little bit by maybe discounting their bills I would still like to find a career where I can do more for people."
good,"No budget was given for support management which meant every event you had to handle, control or produce yourself.  Took a lot of hours for larger events 1200 pp lunches, 800 pp sit down dinners"
good,Comcast is a fast paced culture focused on bottom line cash flow while investing in technology and platforms to propel growth.  Great people who worked well together under stress while staying personable.
good,"Comcast is a great organization to learn and advance a career. "
good,Never any relaxation extremly poor management fosters a feeling of ignorance . By failing to Communicate busines changes effectively you find yourself selling a package that may no longer be available or Point of Sale Price has changed and content also changed
good,Comcast is a great place to work. The only downside is if you are in direct sales. Because of the bad image that the company has as a whole no customer wants to talk with you. You literally have to hustle and manipulate customers to get then to buy. If you can do this and are willing to tell some little lies (like we fixed those issues when in reality they hadnt) to potential customers then you will go far and be paid extremely well. All I have to say is this job is not for everyone.
good,"A typical day at Comcast would involve interacting with customers to explain charges on their bill, make payment arrangements, or posting a credit towards their bill for questionable charges."
good,"Great place to work, employees and managers are engaging and enjoyable. They care about their employees and the work they do, the compensation for pay is the only thing lacking here. Career advancement is decent but has glass ceilings in progression that might make you inclined to leave."
good,Usually very flexible with hours and scheduling. A lot of advancement opportunities to move within the departments and with in the company. Numerouss divisions to provide advancement
good,"In the morning we start by running reports for the day before, to see what work order are still open, pending or not done. After that is done we work the report to complete install or disconnect requested by the customer."
good,"Good Place to Work You will succeed as long as you do your expected job. Keep your numbers up, to what is expected of you and Be on Time on a daily basis, for you Shift, Breaks, and lunches."
good,Comcast has it's benefits and there are many. Don't complain and do at least the bare minimum. Follow the rules. You might actually have a career. Be careful who you trust.
good,"Overall great company good perks and benefits, good workplace and very competitive products. Not very easy to get promoted, long process to even transfer you."
good,management not very considerate re shift trades or swap of hours. They are a very diverse work place environment and I did enjoy the people i worked with. There was a lack of communication between management though.
good,"Comcast Spotlight is a fast paced place to work, no day is ever the same. It can be stressful with an ever changing workplace due to client changes, industry changes, technology changes.  You decide what your paycheck is, relationship building is a must, being a trusted adviser to your clients is key to being a successful AE."
good,If you are a college student this position is right for you. Great part-time hours AND you work Monday- Friday. I would suggest this positon to any college student with minimal to no financial responsibilities.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work, once you fully understand your daily routine.  Its not hard, but if you do not ask questions or fully comprehend your job role you may jeopardize your career immediately."
good,"Taking calls back to back, with almost no downtime in between. Most of the customers who called in were not pleased to speak with us. This was due to the fact that they had been done by several agents prior to reaching me. Most of my stress was caused by being berated by the customers on over 90% of the incoming calls."
good,"It is a friendly place to work  and the pay is very  good there is a high turn over  but over all great atmosphere to work at, they are a goal oriented place and they make you feel like a part of a team."
good,"Job was pretty easy.  Assisted customers with internet, phone and cable issues.  Also did upselling and customer service  Most coworkers were nice and friendly."
good,"The job itself is relatively easy and the day to day is great. But they're very persistent about sales goals. And if you get a bad area, which you just may as a new hire, then it might be that much tougher."
good,Telemarketing is quota driven; in some cases stressful.  Employees receive a discount on Comcast cable services.  Multicultural environment.  The company does outreach services in the community at-large.  Employees are recognized for making quotas.  Company wide sales records are celebrated when applicable.
good,Comcast is great workplace. A very friendly environment. All departments of the staff are all well-informed. Enjoyable shifts with new events everyday
good,This employer was very good place to be hired at.  They began to contract out some positions because of a hiring freeze during my employment which made advancement a little scarce but other than that it was a nice place  to work.
good,Comcast is a decent job to get started professionally.  There does not seem to be much room for advancement for those with advanced degrees unless they start in corporate.
good,"I really did enjoy the learning experience, they have very strict rules which made it very comfortable for me because I like structure.. fun online schooling before hired in. I would have stayed employed if my company didn't loose there contract with them. You definitely have to practice malti-tasking all day!"
good,The benefits at Comcast are wonderful.  The work load is a lot.  Some days it seems manageable and others it seems impossible.  Love the people I work with.  Deadlines are hard.  You have to be organized and be able to multitask.  Never a dull moment.  You definitely earn your pay here.
good,"Had a strong team of writers, producers and Techs. Talent was also top notch. Would still be working there if the division of the company was still around."
good,The company will fight to keep their employees and do believe in promoting from within. A small raise every 6 months if you met metric sales goals standard requirements.
good,"Days went by superfast"
good,"This company is an excellent place to learn, as well as sustain a professional sports television production career.  Thoroughly enjoyed my time there and my experiences there will always stay with me."
good,"I assisted 4 account executives with their day to day selling commercial times. I have learned how to manage several people day to day attitudes and I love to see the smile and hear gratitude when I have done a great job from the AE's. I don't think I have had  hard time that was really hard for me, I accept any challenges that come my way. Everyday was an enjoyment for me because I had a job."
good,Its an okay place to work.. They dont pay too well but it has great benefits. Very fast paced. And you have to lift heavy equipment sometimes. they dont give long enough breaks.
good,i loved working for comcast. everything was going great.  the only problem is the job security. comcast will stand behind the customer when anything happens and leave the tech out in the rain.
good,"Comcast is a wonderful company to work for great employee concern, appreciation and gift giving.  Not only great benefits.  It was a long wait to get hired in full time if you were hired in part time I really needed full time."
good,"Comcast is an up and down company."
good,Comcast is a good place to work and the benefits are great.  I have learned a lot about the cable industry and every day brings a new challenge.  It has been a good experience and has helped me grow in my career.
good,Very fast decisions making management and has full freedom to different exposure of technologies and free place to share ideas and put your opinion. Work place is awesome.
good,"At the start of the day, I would make contact with my supervisor to gather a list of priority assignments for my coverage area.  I would proceed to complete the priority assignments and report back to my supervisor.  The remainder of the day would be spent supporting the installation technicians or node optimization."
good,"Comcast was very people oriented in the beginning.  It was like working with members of your family for the most part.  However as the company became centralized, it lost the personal feel not just for the customers but for the employees also."
good,"Working for Comcast has given me a lot of new abilities, and a lot of headaches. While the pay is astounding and the benefits are amazing, the culture is less than desirable. They often put aside agent and customer happiness to maximize profits. I would recommend Comcast as a good job, but probably not a long term career."
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for if you are looking for good benefits.  However they are not quick to promote within.  In this stage of my life, I was looking for quicker advancement.  So if you are just starting out, I definitely recommend getting your foot in the door at Comcast"
good,Answering all billing questions. I learned I had a knack for calming people down. Management was easy to work with and very creative and uplifting. A positive place to work with constant fun contests going on. Dealing with challenging and very disgruntled customers constantly can be taxing. The best part of the job was the working for a company that truly cared.
good,"Great benefits, great people.  No day is the same.  Challenges and opportunities to make a difference to some extent.  Proud of our innovations, however and the belief that customer comes first."
good,"typical day included door to door sales of home video, digital phone and internet services. I learned that door to door sales is very hard yet very rewarding"
good,"After logging , i use to take in coming calls from customer who want to disconnect there service, and my job was to retain that customer."
good,"coworkers are great people, management can be micromanager at times. benefits are wonderful and they really treat employees well. Only downside is sometimes they make our jobs harder than it has to be. Sales is already a difficult job so they should be trying to make it easier for us."
good,Ver;y good company to work for. Great benefits and 401 K package. great managers always on the floor to help while on the phone with customers would work for them in the future if they offered at home work
good,"Productive and a developmental atmosphere. The company did offer good benefits such as medical, dental, vision, and a 401K plan which is matched dollar for dollar."
good,"The culture where I worked was ""get the job done at all cost."" I was management so I was driven to work longer hours, because of the work load. This company does have great benefits, but the hours that I had to work was working against my home life."
good,Working here for the amount of time I had was a great experience.  Learning new programs and operations is always a plus in my book.  The people there were easy to get along with.
good,"Comcast offers excellent benefits, however the salary does not satisfy the average employee. The work environment is extremely stressful. The best part of working at Comcast is the discounted services, and free items from vendors, incentive programs etc"
good,The hardest part of the job is working 12 to 13 hours a day having a family. I will say I have learned a variety of skills and enhanced my training skills while working in the Comcast environment.
good,On a day to day your job changes depending on the type of calls you get to the emails that you receive. You have corp. escalations on a day to day with different issues.
good,"Comcast is a very innovative and forward thinking company that tries to make themselves as involve as possible in resenting entertainment to the society; the management team is very helpful, knowledgeable, supportive and motivating which is needed for that type of environment that customers sometimes abuse the employees."
good,- It was a great experience. I learned alot technology and behind the scenes of cable. Each day I calculated all the tickets received by the drivers and contacted counsel members to come to comcast events.
good,"I was in Business Tech Support. It was a call center environment. I answered calls and helped customers with issues, wanted to upgrade their services, pay bills, or troubleshoot their services"
good,"I appreciated where I worked and the employees were good workers, easy to get along with. The management is average if you know what you are doing, accomodations are very poor for people who have health problems."
good,"Free time to get your day done but periodic meetings that were unnecessary most of the time."
good,The people at Comcast Spotlight are wonderful. A great group of talented people working together to provide customized advertising solutions for local businesses. We take the time to learn about our client's business to match the right media plan to help them overcome the challenges they face.
good,Comcast was a great place to receive experience in the field. They had a great training program which taught skills that were transferable.
good,"Never had any major issues, flexibility was a must. Being alone in an office was sometimes frustrating, always had management support, fellow workers always willing to help. Worked there for 27 years, at many locations, with various people - enjoyed it all."
good,"Management was fair, but job was either very boring or overwhelming. Either few customers or long lines.It was a temp job, though, so direct hires may have different experiences."
good,"Comcast will definitely draw out talents and skills you never thought you had. It is an environment that challenges groups or individuals to think outside the box. "
good,This was a awesome job the environment was great. Down fall was just being young and not understanding job security. was a very enjoyable job benefits were great.
good,"Sometimes the business is unaware of what the customer wants or more importantly how they are treated.  The majority of customers want a bargain plan, and they do not need 100 meg DS service."
good,"A great place to work!, Many oppurtunities for those willing to learn and grow.  Great leaders with a great culture!  It is said the only constant at Comcast is change and that is the truth! If you are not flexible and adaptable you will not find success here."
good,Set up technicians that are working for the day. Once that is done. Make sure techs have work in there log. Assist techs with making there appointments on time. My coworkers were great. It took total teamwork to get things done. I have enjoyed the job because the focus is on the customer.
good,"A typical day was being provided a route that consisted of 3-5 jobs, throughout the day you had to troubleshoot on the spot which I enjoyed the most in order to ensure the customer was satisfied. The goal was not having to make a repeat return to the same customer because you failed to do something correctly and I consistently had the lowest repeat %."
good,There were not a lot of ways to advance to the next level. This company was very content with the managers they had already. No room for advancement. I want a career instead of a job.Also the commute was very hard for me.
good,"A typical work day consisted of taking around 20 calls a day, repeating almost identical sales pitches. So far, I've learned not to judge a book by its cover. People will buy what they desire, whether they've got the money or not. The management I'd say is poor compared to most places I've worked. Communications is a big con. My coworkers I don't mind so much until they start getting loud and talking while others are on a phone call. The hardest part about this job I'd say is that it gets so repetitive. The most enjoyable part about this job is talking to different people and not having to worry about paying a high bill for cable or internet."
good,"Comcast was a diverse culture and offered lots of options for different employees. They were and excellent place to work for , just the schedule you had to pick every few months left me unable to work and balance my family and childcare options."
good,Dealing with the angriest of angry customers was very frustrating with little reward. There was little room for advancement and the position was highly stressful.
good,Comcast was a great company to work for. The compensation was good and the environment was comfortable and friendly. They where sticklers for the numbers but what company isn't when it comes down to it. The call value at the Call Center was pretty high regularly but manageable.
good,"There are a lot of layers of management at this company and it can get confusing sometimes.  Good benefits, though.  one of the best health plans I have found."
good,Comcast is the best place to work form the business all the way down to the workers its number one in everything and it a job the you actually look to coming to everyday I'm  grateful for my 9 years of employment
good,"I liked my job except that the company says they want you to provide customer service but yet times you on your calls, don't want you to call customers back, if call get disconnected the customer can't get back to you they would have to start over with another specialist If you called a customer back it was negatively held against you.  "
good,I loved working at Comcast because I got to meet new people everyday. Comcast taught me a lot about installation and how to deal with customers. working at Comcast I learned something new every day and I loved that.
good,"In my role at Comcast, I worked in a great group and really enjoyed the environment and culture. Our group had a good mix of young people and encouraged a strong work ethic. In the early years I worked at Comcast, there were great benefits and perks including free cable. I did, however find it difficult to advance in my role unless I moved to a different department as the people above me were in comfortable long-term roles."
good,"Typical call center environment. Comcast as a whole is a great company. Pay is very good, great benefits, and incentive after incentive. Customers are horrible and management is not far from it either. Most supervisors arent real supervisors and tend to not help employees especially if you are not specifically apart of their team."
good,Comcast is a good company to work for. befits are good. they have an extensive safety and training program. Comcast also have many discounts from other company's for the employees can take advantage of only con is they have yearly reorgs.
good,"A typical day consisted of a morning meeting followed up by reaching out to potential prospective customers of which you spoke with the day/week before, and hitting the field to obtain sales quota for a bi-weekly period. "
good,"As with all companies there are oppertunities to improve and, it seems like the time it takes to implement positive change can take forever! I've work for good leaders and bad. The company's core values are great! Unfortunately some senior leaders (that I currently have) fail to listen to frontline employees feedback about improving the customer experience. This leads to some employees feeling unvalued and defeated when it comes to building a good brand."
good,Comcast is a great place to work if you can handle stress and change. You deal with irate customers 50 percent of the day which helps you to learn to empathize with a customer and build rapport with them to assist them better but at the same time that is the stressful part of the job as well. You have to be able to adapt to the constantly changing atmosphere at comast.
good,Innovator of cutting edge technology products that enhance the customer experience. Working hard to improve reputation with customers. The corporate team structure is difficult with teams reporting to leadership in different states. Creates massive gaps in vision and strategy.
good,"Pretty cool job, there is just a really long wait before you can move up to another position within the company. Also, it doesn't pay that much compared to similar jobs. They DO have commission but it is not that great. The commission is either $7 or $4 per sale. So if you are a skilled telesalesperson then you will make a decent amount of money. I am a good telesalesperson but the commission amounts are still not that great in my opinion. The company however is very forward thinking. The higher ups are very big on listening to the employees to see what we may want to change or add on. "
good,"Comcast is a giant company with many entry level positions and a lot of opportunities for employees to make lateral and upward moves if they are willing to work hard and have patience. Comcast treats their employees very well, offering decent pay, ample time off, health benefits, and courtesy services (discounted internet, cable, and phone). Comcasters are very friendly and welcoming. Each shop tries it's best to emulate a family/team environment. That said, being such a large company, there is often miscommunication between departments and the company as a whole is very slow to respond to customer complaints and market changes. While it is easy to talk to direct supervisors and managers, it is all but impossible for those at the lowest levels of the company to submit ideas that could change the company at large, regardless of how beneficial those ideas may be. "
good,"A typical day at Comcast, i would set up my table, track down directly and indirectly residential sales to provide cable, phone and internet installations. i would also assist with inventory and including promotional packages to reduce customers monthly bills.Management provided excellent training. I worked primarily independently. The hardest part of the job was learning to accept rejection in different situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help save customers their monthly bill."
good,Comcast is a company that constantly changes their minds on how actions should be performed.   Comcast yes is a good company and the benefits are great.  However as a number there is little chance for contributions that will be considered.
good,"Various duties including sales, customer solutions, cash handling, maintenance, and much more. i learned various sales techniques as well as customer relations. co workers were great, i love the team spirit that was around the store. the hardest part of the job was also the most rewarding which was adapting the ability to help come to a mutual conclusion with any customer."
good,The Comcast Oregon SW Washington region is a great market with extremely high standards for its employees. You must recognize these high standards early on and be willing to meet these high standards consistently. One you grasp the  work standards you will learn that the work environment can be rewarding and educational.
good,"Receiving incoming calls. "
good,"A typical day at Comcast is fast pace,while giving the customer the best customer service.My team was very hard working.The hardest part of the job,when a customer did not have an enjoyable experience."
good,"My position required being in good physical shape and advance knowledge of Cable TV Plant construction. Constant mind set in the fact that you were working just a few feet away from high voltage. Safety practices is an absolute must. Most work load was provided ahead of time. The ""fielding"" of the job site was important in the need for calling in locates or other hazards that may be encountered."
good,The people are great and so is the job. The training was extensive which found beneficial. Theres a lot of opportunity in the company.
good,"A typical day working for Comcast in the Retention Department would consist of receiving approximately 50 calls daily. De escalate callers who may be irate  in regards to a billing, technical, or lack of customer service. Persuade customers to upgrade their services to increase revenue. Attend team meetings and or trainings. Respond to daily emails. Chat through instant message board to share best practices. I learned how to get multiple projects done in a timely and accurate manner. There are some supervisors who are knowledgeable of their jobs, and others who are there to collect a check. There are over 300 agents in the building. Typically had a few that I associated with on a professional level. The hardest part of my job was working with the billing department who would transfer their calls to retention because they didn't want to assist the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job were the incentives that the company would provide to you based off your performance."
good,company use to give good benefits to the employs. Work culture use to be very good.and the management is good.
good,"Comcast provided me with an excellent opportunity to grow my knowledge of corporate accounting, and add skills to my resume. "
good,"Perfect place to work"
good,"Assisted customers with technical issues and product inquiries. I obtained and implemented knowledge of the companies business model, goals, and  business practices. The management staff was very helpful and shared knowledge and guidance to improve overall performance. The co-workers were friendly and helpful with assistance. We shared and exchanged knowledge of the business practices and goals to implement into every business day. The challenging part of employment was knowing the position was only temporary. Every business day I found enjoyment experiencing diverse challenges and resolving them."
good,"Working for Comcast was a great experience I was young and right out of high school when I started here, I started in the call center and had a great management/support team.  I answered calls from customers with questions about billing, packages, services, pretty much anything.  I had wonderful co-workers and a manager who believed in me and pushed me through on customer service training.  She later advanced me on the front desk, where she thought I was a great fill in for the receptionist or front desk reps when they were off on sick leave or vacation.  Here I also helped with billing questions, took payments, kept a balanced drawer, helped guest with their services, and equipment,  As the receptionist I answered a multi-line phone and transferred calls, sorted mail, and assisted anyone who came in to see mangers or programming.  I did enjoy working for Comcast, the managers there were great, but the hardest part was the late hours and being yelled at because of power outages."
good,"This was a call center position that typically dealt with customer billing, new and existing services, and working to get customers the services best suited for their needs. The biggest lesson I learned from this job was that, despite my role, I have my limits in selling services to people who can't afford them. My co-workers were humorous, intelligent, easy-going, and hardworking people who actually made the work atmosphere less pressurized. Management had a job to do and although the bottom line was to increase customer numbers, management was amiable and pleasant and accommodating with employees."
good,every day was busy and sometimes challenging- never boring- great team- we were always learning new processes -they were accommodating with the schedule and even let some of us work from home for a couple of years.
good,This was my first job out of college and has provided me with so many learning opportunities and unique experiences that I am very grateful for.
good,"Great work environment and great benefits such as discounted cable TV, internet, and phone service.  Quarterly bonuses and Time Off Banks provided after 90 days employment. Good health benefits & 401k and stock plans."
good,"Ping pong, pool table, employee appreciation days, random prizes and gifts.  Just some of the nice things about Comcast.  Career path plan is a very distinct method to enhance your skills and increase pay.  Co workers are fantastic and you will make some great friends."
good,Comcast is great if you have the take charge mentality. Comcast wants problem solvers and people who are willing to go the extra mile to help a customer. I'm in Retail Sales so my job is customer facing. I setup a table in a retail location like Walmart and tell people about our products.
good,"very upward and  moving company, and fun working place with very different products to offer customer a wide range of products ie  phone service internet and cable"
good,An overall good place to work relating to the culture and technology involved in the business.  Enjoyed working with different contractors and getting to meet new people and making new friends.
good,A typical day consisted of reviewing prior day's performance . I would then go to each of my Supervisors desk to see what challenges they had planned for the day. I would usually have at least one or two process meetings to review roll outs of new procedures to the call center floor. My peers were great and I had a great team of Supervisors. The hardest part of job was keeping the motivation up with tenured Supervisors. The most enjoyable part was seeing my team members get promoted.
good,"I loved the new challenges from day to day and learning new ways of doing production, I enjoyed the producing and directing of two paid shows for Comcast local origination channel and the opportunity of meeting new people. While at Comcast I was an instructor in the video production department, meet many interesting people, that made me laugh and smile, had some nice supervisors male and female, Comcast paid for classes I needed to have to better myself  in editing and one supervisor class, enjoyed the department outing of paint ball game...that was fun! Also while at Comcast I was give the opportunity to work on many indie movies and commercials as director, assistant director, camera operator, gaffer, and audio person outside of working for Comcast."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"Family like environment, opportunity to learn a lot, exciting innovation. Growth potential is great. I learned every aspect of the business."
good,"*Nice co-workers"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was, working on my own.I set my appointments,follow-ups and installations.I worked closely with the engineering department,having cable built to new and existing properties.Typical day was following up on every thing that was scheduled,and making sure it was done and the customer was satisfied.Answering all ph.messages and emails,following up on leads,making new phone calls to generate new bussiness,and setting appts.to meet with prospects.Management changed many times.But no problems there! Except management was not helpful keeping co-workers out of my designated zip codes."
good,"Comcast was great, I was a contractor who worked mainly on MDU units and trained other techs on how to be better installers. I loved the new individuals I met doing tech work and missed it as I was a supervisor."
good,"At Comcast I learned that the world of telecommunications is a fast paced, yet very educational field and there are always opportunities to grow, re-evaluate, learn and retain information."
good,Best Buy is your typical retail job. Nothing spectacular. The people you work with is great. Change is always happening. They have fun ways to keep up with product knowledge so there's lot of training to be done in a day.
good,Cutting edge telecommunications company with a very strong focus on employee engagement. Fast-paced product deployment with employee support through training. Inclusive value system.
good,Get in if you can. Great atmosphere. A little awkward with full time employee's welcoming contractors. Lot's of work to do.
good,"making and receiving calls, billing, data entry technical support. Very number oriented and focused of every aspect of taking specific calls. Management is very laid back fun to work with."
good,Comcast was a nice place to work. The compensation was great as well as the benefits. We were always being given different items to take home or put on our desks and we were fed quite often from catering to bbqs. There was also an on sight gym.
good,Comcast has a great work/life balance but you need to be a part of the right team to receive the full benefits of the company.
good,A good place to work as long as its not top hot. They tend to change rules and raise requirements more than normal. Nice to be able to move at your own pace.
good,"Great pay, good benefits, and excellent service discounts."

good,Fine place to work. Great opportunity. Great people. Decent company. Learned a lot of information. Don't have anything else to say.
good,great people and great team environment. There are some inconsistencies with management and if your Sup is not off it's almost impossible to get help from another sup.
good,Great place to work with the pressure of performing management jobs in an environment that i was able to learn from my mistakes.
good,"I had a great manager, and team. My only issue was the commute to work, and their calls expectation, but I have heard from current employee that they have changed completely. Which it make it easier for worker to deal with."
good,I was a subcontractor for them and It was really fun going to new places everyday.  It really required problem solving skills and ability to communicate with customers
good,"Great place to work if you are an employee, stinks to be a contractor which Comcast loves to hire. Communication is always an issue as most teams have members where English is a second language. Management clueless it times to the challenges employees face."
good,"Overall I loved my experience here. It had a great culture, great management and training, fair pay and commission with upward mobility. The only negative was that the hours were late, and weekends."
good,"Great benefits and a pleasant atmosphere to work in. Love the coworkers and management staff. Shifting policies, guidelines, and lack of communication can sometimes be a hindrance."

good,What I love about Comcast is you can grow in the company within a short amount of time. I learned how to be more creative in my gift for gab. My co-workers were very helpful and the hardest part of the job is facing rejection.
good,"Completed migration and deployment from legacy DNCS to EC, staging UCS240 Servers with VMWare, ESXi."
good,"It is a grind, and very difficult to advance. The real problem is taking forty to fifty calls a day, when half the customers are mad at Comcast (rightly or wrongly). The customer service rep has very limited power, and not everyone understands that. I learned to be up front with people, and say ""there is nothing else I CAN do""."
good,"• Respectfully assisted customers in troubleshooting their cable equipment to get it working the way it should"
good,"Comcast is a place for someone with motivation, great communication skills, and has a thrill for technology.At this company you would learn what it takes to become a outstanding leader."
good,"Comcast is a company that strives for excellence in everything they do. The company dynamic makes every effort to give each and every customer the satisfaction of services they require. When it comes to employees, they do their best to ensure the advancement of each and every individual. This is done either through tuition assistance for college, or by advance technical schooling internally. Overall Comcast was a good company to work for."
good,Typical day in TS is pretty hard over 100 calls in que over 8 hr shift..It can be very stressful but the management team makes it very easy. They have a quiet room where you can just go sit in the dark on break to releax sometimes caters lunch always try to boost call center moral by playing games and incentatives. the hardest part o the day is not being able to solve the customers issue and having to schedule a time frame beyond what they are willing to wait. I can handle escalated issues and irrate customers.
good,"I was required to make sure the hubs that I  was responsible were managed (internet, video on demand, and video) was working fine.  I learned how to install routers, cards, new computer skills, etc.  Management was mostly hands off.  I worked well with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was driving long distances.  I enjoyed the freedom of the job."
good,"For me, Comcast provided an excellent opportunity to grow my career. "
good,I would have stayed with them had they not left California. It was a typical inbound call center environment but because of my skills added to some excellent training I was able to excel in all my metric scores and became valuable and relied on to my Supervisors and fellow team members. I was selected for a lot of special teams and projects where additional duties fell outside of the routine. Comcast was very good about recognizing an agent's ability and metrics.
good,Comcast is a great place to work.  I'm only leaving becasue I'm looking for a change and trying to get out of customer service jobs.
good,"can be a great environment to work in, allowed me to master some of my skills that I have been able to use in outside of work situations"
good,Good if you are new to the field of electronic tech but if you have experience only good for a temp filler till you can get a higher paying job due to there not being a way in the company to be hired in to a position that u would be in other places all people l with or without experience start as a tech1 and move up.
good,Good salary and benefits. Company with opportunity to grow within company in different ways. Culture and environment continue to be a focus of improvement that company grows.

good,Assist customers with their billing and product needs.  Troubleshoot technical issues. Log into system to answer calls in reference to Comcast service.  Accept customer payment via credit card and check.  Explain billing and offer new service and upgraded packages.  Perform within company guidelines
good,I didn't want to leave but decided that Cellular was where I wanted to go. I enjoyed working for Comcast and would return if allowed but in another position. The PM role was more of an administrators position and didn't challenge me at all.
good,"I have worked here for years. "
good,"I found that working for Comcast wasn't a job or career but more of a way of life. The hours were long and the pay was great but it took a big toll on my family life. If I were able to do it again ,but only part time."
good,I have been at Comcast for 6 years and they are a good place to work. I am looking for something that allows me to further my career with a company and this company does not have any advancement opportunities within my department.
good,"Answering and solving both technical and fiscal problems."
good,"Work starts on time and in an orderly fashion . As the day goes on, it gets kind of hectic. Management pushes a little too much, always about the numbers, not enough concern about how the work is done, only that it is done. Very hard working co-workers, concerned about the job."
good,"Great exposure in the department I support.  Comcast is an innovative company with a lot to offer people who are interested in the technology industry.  The hardest part of the job is that technology never sleeps, so work-life balance can be overlooked if you don't live to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the cable and internet discounts!"
good,"There were definitely some tough times especially when they decided to go VOIP aka ""Comcast Digital Voice"". It was a product that wasn't the greatest (ATT now has it and they too are struggling with it). Overall, I enjoyed my time there. I think the pay was fair and the hours weren't all that bad although it can be easily stressful especially on Fridays (payday) and anytime we were flooded with calls form customers due to outages. "
good,"I like the team players, the supervisors were very encouraging and they had good job incentives/bonuses"
good,Never worked with such a great management team. Truly cared about you as an employee.
good,"a ty•a typical day at work"
good,"A typical day consisted of taking 20 to 30 calls from business customers, and assisting them with issues ranging from billing to technical, for internet, phone, and TV services."
good,Its a very rewarding but tough job at the same time.  Excellent Co workers.
good,Its is a little stressful due to the expectations. The managers are very down to earth. Hate how commission is distrubuted
good,"Learned a lot, time management how to work with a different diversity of people. Kept close contact with higher management."
good,"Another day in the life of a call center agent. I had time to work in retention and tech support, so I have a wide range of experience in customer service. Management was fine, but there didn't seem like there was room to advance. The people who worked with me were great and there wasn't a hard part about my job."
good,"its very fast paced work environment with great customer service, need to have the ability to work well in the environment."
good,Typically in and out of customers home's troubleshooting or installing cable services I'm a people person so I pretty much enjoy the job we just have long wait times when calling in to add or change things that could be better but overall not bad
good,was a good job and paid well with plenty of vacation time. only downfall was really your sitting in the same spot all day and job can be very stressful at times.
good,Professional and Good ethics; great opportunity for advancement; fun place to work; co-workers are respectful and nice; commuting was the hardest part of the job;  the most enjoyable part is the extra Jewish holidays
good,Everyone works together as a team to get the job done! I worked with great co-workers who would help out at anytime if needed.
good,"well you start out swinging you start at 7am and its non stop action till the time you get off by doing installs and service calls while I was there I learned so much about the cabling industry I.E. understanding of radio freq, Db's, electricity, how to properly climb poles and structures. you will build great relations with your co-workers as you depend on each other to get through the day. The hardest part of your job would be the big installs in some of the big homes in the area and the best part about the job is seeing it all come together after a big job and everything is working properly"
good,"Comcast is and exciting place to work. Team work and results are the main focus and the supervisory staff work hard to help employees become successful. The work is challenging, but not overwhlming and the training is detailed and extensive. I learned so much about how to satisfy customer needs and remain cheerful through the stress. The hardest part was keeping up with all of the constant changes. The most enjoyable part was helping frustrated customers and resolving their issues. Over all, comcast was a great place to work."
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for. They give lots of incentives and do little things weekly to to boost esteem from giving away popcorn to giving away cars. I feel they should promote from within more, especially with their supervisors. The hardest part of the job is the high stress environment."
good,"Typical day consisted of working outside and inside customer homes. "
good,"Answering billing calls, assisting customers over the phone and up-selling different products to customers. I've learned how to multitask different ventures here, also how to work in a diverse environment. Very professional supervisors and managers, very hands on. Co-workers are from all walks of life and different backgrounds. Most difficult part of the job is the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing were providing outstanding customer service."
good,Typical work day is answering phones and selling the product to the customers. I've learned to build a relationship with the customers. They feel more comfortable with buying from you when they trust you.
good,Comcast was a great place to work.. My customer service career flourished there.
good,Yet great benefits working with comcast but you are micro managed. Most employees are ghetto and thats why comcast has such a poor reputation for customer service. Hard to advance in the company and rarely hire from within.
good,"Lovely environment"
good,"Comcast is a great place to work at. Great benefits, great work environment, friendly co-workers. Everything was just great but the job security isn't up to par. After a 5 day medical leave I was let go for who knows why but besides that I loved working at comcast. The most enjoyable part about comcast is attending to the customer needs in my opinion but it could also be the hardest part of the job."
good,"Tipical day taking inbound calls, billing, customer support, tech support and admin assistance. Co-workers were always a joy to work with, with all their support and assistance. loved the 4-10 work shifts."
good,"I learned a lot at Comcast. I came in during the launch of digital cable and watched the industry expand beyond belief. There are no jobs left in the system I worked in because of the restructuring the organization undertook. "
good,".started on the dot, monitored from the minute we sign on to the minute we leave"
good,"• Assist in the execution of all in-game promotions under the direction and supervision of the Game Operations Coordinator"
good,"I am tasked with collecting on past due and shut off accounts to restore services for Comcast clientele. Typical day consists of 8 hours of taking phone calls, while stationed in front of a computer, in a cubicle. Management is nearby but do not take calls, unless absolutely needed they are there to manage more of the day to day operations. The nice part of the job is the coworkers you meet and friendship you can make."
good,"Full customer service, take payment, explain bill, trouble shoot sale products"

good,Comcast is a wonderful company to work for. I worked in customer service with a great supervisor.
good,"Taking calls for technical support for cable and internet."
good,Comcast is a great place to work. Retention is a great department. The hours were hard to deal with having 3 small children. New employees get the 12:45p- 9:15p shift. Hardly get schedule changes and employees with tenure get first pick on morning schedule.
good,I enjoyed helping the customer resolve the issues. We trouble shot high speed internet and phone service. Also promoted product and upgraded service pages.
good,"Enjoyable coworkers, good benefits, good work life balance"
good,I loved working at Comcast it was a great environment to work at and commission was nice the training was very easy
good,Comcast provides great benefits and the opportunity for advancement is there. The scheduling is a little inconvenient but overall good position.
good,"I enjoyed my experience at this company. I enjoyed the field and selling products .However, I did not like the travel and having to pay for my gasoline while traveling out of state and into rougher neighborhoods trying to sell the product."
good,"My typical day involved going from door to selling cable services (TV and internet).  My manager at the time realized my abilities to work crowded events such as the state fair and we created a team that would work all events in our area that Adelphia was a part of.  We created a plan of action for events and made adjustments based on the what demographics of expected attendees.  This was very successful, however changes in regional management and Comcast takeover of Adelphia doomed the program."
good,"Great company to work for if you are in the right division. Benefits are good, pay is good. Management is pretty good. The 2nd C in comcast is change so you must be willing to change with the business."
good,Comcast offered great benefits to employees along with commission for the services you sold.
good,"a typical day at work for me was meeting lots of people of all different types of back grounds, i worked in all kinds of weather conditions, i learn a lot about being patients with people & working as a team with coworkers, the hardest part of the was dealing with in-climate weather, the part i enjoyed the most was meeting lots different people & being out on your own"
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for, I have learn a lot by working at comcast. I started off in telesales and work myself up to retail sales and now I work in dispatch. I love the management staff I just wish I got paid alot more. The most enjoyable part ablout my job is working with a great group of people and the open door policy."
good,"Run performance and improvement training and help clients as well as employees to better their abilities to do their jobs."
good,"-a typical day at work involved answering incoming calls constantly and assisting customers with any concerns as well as being a team lead to help my coworkers with any problems."
good,"Inbound sales support. Tv, Phone, Internet and Home Security."
good,"A day at Comcast you never knew what to expect, So Ive learned to incorporate all my training and mange every case as needed. The independent work style allowed the management staff to focus on there task. Which leads too co workers and the team support all Comcast team member. The hardest thing may be taking a breath in a high volume day but, you will have the opportunity to meet some amazing people"
good,Comcast was a fun environment to work at but the only down fall of it was that supervisors were more focused on they're stats in the over all call center than they were with helping you improve.
good,"comcast is an excellent place to work, but theyve got a long way to go in filtering out some of the old bad habits that are entrenched there.  the politics and games make it almost impossible to get the smallest of tasks complete."
good,"A typical day at work requires daily sales quota to achieve. Aside of quota achievements, the overall focus is to provide excellent and thorough customer service to comcast subscribers. Working in the retail store, your job is to recieve payments for current accounts, overdue charges, and deposits for new subscribers. Also, customers will bring in non-working or malfunctioned equipment such as cable boxes, Internet modems, and or in need of new remotes/cables.  Your job is to exchange those malfunctioned pieces out with new functioning equipment while upselling customers. Providing information about new products, services, & benefits in terms of upgrading customers on their Comcast services. Your monthly quota typically consists of 40 new internet customers, 35 cable customers, 15 landline customers, 2 home alarm customers and 100 Account upgrades. For the two years of employment with Comcast, I achieved a high percentage of hitting my quotas month to month. Accumulating a high commission rate along with several perks and extra money. Management was not too supporitive when escalations occured. So your job is to maintain a professional demeanor as you are a representative of a great frachise. The hardest part of the job consisted of the pressure month to month for achieving the high amounts of quota, but the pressure always drove me to hit the proper numbers, also resulting in exceeding the quota. Another hard part was dealing with a lot of upset customers and figuring out great soultions to they leave as a satisfied customer."
good,"Being a Comcast technician I enjoyed meeting people around the city, and the job was easy to learn. The down side is the amount of work they expect a technician to do. They give techs a goal for the amount of work they want done, but they give out way more work than what the goal is. Overtime is expected because of this. When I left the company moral was very low among technicians, and the supervisors were clueless about this. "
good,Motivated employees to reach and exceed goals. Coaches and develops employees for performance improvements. I really enjoyed interacting with the team. Retained customers through great service and dedication to resolving their problems right the first time. Participated in several training and development courses to help further my career.
good,Decent job under the right management. Can be stressful and have long hours at times.
good,"Worked for this company for 12 years and enjoyed it.  However, meeting set goals was challenging at times due to hard economic times."

Promote technicians by observing, coaching, training and mentoring proficiencies and all duties from Installer to line technician. Able to perform duties of Installer, Line Technician and Technical Operations Supervisor."
good,Very fast paste receiveing over 100 calls per day. I learned how to handle irate customers and to multi task; using different software tools at once. I worked as a Billing/Video Repair Account Executive. The hardest part of the job for me was to get the customer off the phone within the minutes that was required.  The most enjoyable part was hearing the customer tell me that I made their day and they appreciate my service.
good,"I would start off by reviewing sales and checking orders to make sure customer's where installed.  I would also follow up with customers via telephone if needed.  I would begin my day in the afternoon by going door to door to sell cable,internet and phone service."
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for. Great perks not only with the free cable and internet but also many others including discounts on cell phones and bills, amusement park tickets, etc. Job consisted of troubleshooting cable most of the time. Processing payments and trying to upsell current customers. Learned a lot about the cable/digital system. Management was fair and tried to make work fun. We got a lot of free stuff from various companies associated with Comcast. You get the occasional irate customer but other than that, not hard at all."
good,"Comcast is a great intro to a call center experience, it will teach you to be competitive and to plan ahead. a very divers corporation."
good,"Working at Comcast is challenging yet rewarding.  I enjoy resolving issues for customers and helping them to realize the multiple benefits and value of using our products.  Comcast is an industry leader in developing new technologies, and it's exciting to introduce and promote new products.  I work in a fast-paced call center with supportive and knowledgeable management."
good,"Each day is different. Learned enough to do my job, but limited to not learning more than needed."
good,Fast paced enviorment with opputunities for advancement.
good,Overall very diverse company that believes in promoting women and minorities. Great benefits and salary for its employees.

good,troubleshooting customer with techinal issues with phone service.
good,I enjoyed working for comcast. I was promoted twice within a year. If I still lived in florida I would reapply.
good,"At Comcast I took about 65 calls to 90 calls a day. I learned to key in a network called CSG and also Vision, I learned how to key in orders without looking at a keying guide and became a leader on the team with motivating my co-workers and helping with there orders. Hardest part of the job was changing customers minds in buying Comcast products. Great part was being around positive people."
good,"A typical day would include preparing reports, conference calls, reviewing reports, set goals, travel, coach, recruit, train, and relationship building. I also set up pop and followed plan-o-grams. In addition I set up meetings with partners and trained their sales associates on our products and services."
good,"Typical day at work for me is beta testing a new computer system and running file logs for error testing and feedback for the IT department. I maintain consistent metric based scoring environments by retaining customers based on revenue, needs and communications. The hardest part of the position is learning and maintaining knowledge of all the new products, promotions, pricing, while juggling system errors and constant change in the environment but I also find that one of the most enjoyable things as I am constantly on my feet and being flexible to change."
good,"A typical day dealt with researching and solving submitted tickets showing payment problems and issuing refunds to those that were due a refund. I learned about financial research and more about payment processing within a business. Overall, management was great, although I felt that accomplishments or skill should have been treated with more recognition. I loved working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was handling an unhappy customer, mainly because I felt bad seeing as there was nothing I could do to give them what they wanted and had to offer lesser options or direct the customer to their bank or another party. The most enjoyable part of the job, besides my co-workers, was the variety within the payment problems as this meant every day was different due to circumstances even if we were still following and completing tickets based on a set of rules."
good,"customer / employee balance very good. 90% of work day, support from upper level management very good. "
good,I really like the way the call center was set up. They have cubical and you get to be in your own little world. I liked the fact that you get to help customers without a face to face interactions which can sometimes be a little uncomfortable for most. I also love their computer and phone system.
good,"With Comcast it was always busy,nonstop work which i like makes the day go by fast. A very large company was able to expand my knowledge base on networks with Comcast engineers. great management Team"
good,It was difficult not because of the company but because the work was hard on the emotions.  You were expected to be on and off the phone in a short amount of time and not really able to help the customer. 
good,"Very nice environment with great benefits and perks! There were many fun things that managment did for the employees to make the work enviroment fun and stress free. being on the phone taking inbound calls for the majority of your shift, it was very important for the leadership to make the work place as workable as possible and they achieved that."
good,I am constantly kept on my toes dealing with different Account Executives requests and submissions to get their online campaigns live. Each account executive has their own personality and ways to express themselves. Must adjust on the go. I am exceptional at multi-tasking!
good,I spent 11 years with Comcast. I received excellent benefits as well as a host of perks. I learned a lot.
good,"I typically seat 90% of the day"
good,"It was  a fun environment, the management was ALWAYS there to help and give the right guidance. "
good,"Worked 30hrs a week with full time benefits. Great sales training. Work with great people. I took this job to get my foot in the door, was more interested in having a career on the tech side than this sales job. Hardest part is it is a commission based job with tough goals, best part was helping customers get the most out of their service."
good,A great company to work for I had to leave for health and family reasons but would love to go back and work for Comcast. 
good,Comcast was customer focused and made every effort to see that the customers had a superior experience with first call resolution. They made every effort for the employees to have fun. I loved the flexibility and training that was given to employees and supervisors 
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people. I enjoy customer service and giving my all to all callers. A typical day at work is answer phones and making sure that all callers are satisfied.

good,"Good place to work."
good,"A typical day at work would be at your cubicle calling existing customers to upgrade them with other products/services."
good,Comcast was a great place to work! The company has changed my life.
good,"good company to work for, even though they are a large company the staff all tenmds to work together making the call center feel more like a family owned business- the large company prt steps in though when it comes to policy & procedures"
good,"Field sales working with 35 different clients, worked both from home and in office and field"
good,"Overall Comcast was a great place to work, I personally worked on the Business Class Metro-E and PRI Services. There was always plenty to do and plenty to learn but we were also the last ones to know when something was happening. We had new services and products coming down the pipe frequently but rarely any training to come with them."
good,. Learned a lot about how the cable business works. A typical work day is between 10 to 12 hours with a 1 hour lunch. The management require a lot from employees. Hardest part of the job is working in bad weather. The most enjoyable part of the job is fixing daily problems and see people happy.
good,Working tracking attendance for the call center agents allowed me to the opportunity to get to deal with the agents one on one and build a relationship to help agents in options to help them find a suitable work/life balance. Loved what I did and the people I worked with.
good,Comcast was a nice place to work for. Management could of been better My co-workers were awesome.The hardest part of the job was adjusting to change. The most enjoyable part of the job were the different contest we had for job performance.

good,A typical day at work is taking inbound calls...providing technical support for high speed internet....I really enjoyed my co-workers...i met many people that are to this day still close too...
good,"I worked full-time at Comcast, I am retired now & would have returned to Comcast but they have no part-time positions, only full-time which would interfere w/my Social Security status. A typical day's work schedule consisted of 8-hrs of receiving incoming calls looking for service/pricing on cable tv, hi-speed internet & all distance phone service. It was my job to listen to potential customer's needs/wants & to place them into a package best suited for their needs. This was residential sales the first 2-yrs whereupon I was placed into the B to B sales unit, because of my success in residential. In the B to B unit we would make outgoing cold calls. I was particularly good at getting by the gatekeepers. I have always had good relationships w/my managers & co-workers. The hardest part of my job was keeping-up w/the constant marketing changes which were always being updated or changed weekly. But the most enjoyable part of my job is simply the good feeling I get when I could help somebody."
good,Provided customer service in a high volume call center environment. Provided technical support to Comcast Cable customers. Arranged work orders. Documented all calls and results in database.
good,This is a great place to work with weekly prizes and great monthly bonus for increasing revenue. You will learn a lot about advertising and the entertainment industry while learning skills such as building client rapport and sales strategy.
good,"Great company, great benefis, etc. However, sometimes there were problems with the management and disagreement. At times, there were also examples of managers picking favorites and giving accounts to AE's who did not call on them first or who had not worked them the most. These were few and far between,though. So, overall, I believe it is a great company to work for."
good,In Office around 10:30am to check previously written and installed sales. Once finished in the field cold calling door-to-door
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was planning and executing Comcast Cares Day, a nationwide volunteer day where local employees gave back to their community."
good,The reason to work this call center would be for the benefits and pay. All long as you come to work and you are nice to the customers you pretty much have a job.
good,Troubleshoot internet services. Inbound call for cable billing and repair. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and being able to resolve their issues in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job is not being able to satisfy the customer's need by the end of call. Or they call in irritated and I'm not able to have a smile on their face by the end of the call..
good,"A typical work day includes, meeting at 7am and the get your truck loaded and go to first job by 8am. I like the co-workers and they work well with each other. I didn't enjoy the management process, new rules every week and that is hard to keep up with the new rules."
good,"I must admit, I love this company. I appreciate the benefits most improtantly. I'm waiting to move up...and it's taking some time."
good,"great benefits, good pay IF you can hit quotas, have to compete with other branches of same company on pricing for sales"
good,"High call volume from customers concerning various issues with connectivity, phone service, resolving issues including billing. Originally emphasis was on resolving problems. Later on the concern was more on adding product and scoring for overall timing. My supervisors are no longer employed at Comcast but were helpful and offered constructive criticism when it was needed. The most enjoyable part was resolving an issue and having the customer thank me for my performance. Great training both before being put on the floor and during employment for new methodology."
good,Comcast is a great company to work for. Each day is exciting and the job is always changing. It's a very fast paced enviornment. The workforce is diverse and creates a culture of inclusion. The hardest part of the job is not being able to let go of things that are out of your control. There are too many wonderful things about the job but the greatest aspect is the culture of the business.
good,"I typical day a work in motivating and supporting my team of 16 well trained and highly qualified Customer Account Executives in sales and retaining customers. I work with a team of 22 supervisors and together we manage group of 322 agents in being one of the most successful sales departments within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the most challenging part of the job. Exceeding the goals and metrics in a highly competitive industry, coaching my team in sales and customer service strategies that makes my team a value to the company."
good,THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WOULD BE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL YOUR CALL BACK LEVELS MUST BE AT A CERTAIN PERCENT. If one call back comes in you have to start all over again.
good,"Your typical day at Comcast includes coming to work with a positive attitude. Updating your knowledge about changes in the company via resources provided. Proceed with your job and its requirements, which in my case is coaching."
good,install voice video and data co workers helpful benefits better than some other places
good,"Typical day is assist, counsels employees on day to day life issues as they related to their employment. Compile statistical information for reporting of performance and regulatory compliance, attrition and headcount information. Issues performance reviews to employee's regarding their attendance and performance of the job."
good,Logistically move cable equipment throughout the city of Houston and surrounding city to meet customers need.
good,"A typical day at my current job is always changing, there is never a day that is the same. I have learned and grew a lot in my career at Comcast. I have been very lucky to have had all great bosses and coworker at Comcast. The hardest part of my job I would say is my commute, I have more than 56 miles one way. I enjoy every part of my job, I love working with my external and internal customers as well as working with my fellow coworkers."
good,"I coached, motivated and supported a team of ten (10) customer service agents who addressed Business customer issues regarding billing or technical issues via telephone, e-mail or other media."
good,"I felt my management locally was good, my shift manager was fair, by the book, supportive, and I honestly felt he cared about us as a team. Individually he was supportive in my learning experience and would come out to review my work on occasion. He wasn't critical but he made sure we were doing everything by specifications. Also that we went that extra mile. I appreciate his support and honesty."
good,Comcast is a fast pace company with lots of changes on a daily basis. You must adapt to change quickly and pay attention to details.
good,"Overall, I loved my job as a Tech at Comcast. It was fun, physically demanding, and very calculating. I was able to think and make decisions on my own, work unsupervised, and work outdoors. I was able to meet new people everyday. I increased my yearly earnings by about 50% by working overtime. Unfortunately, I got injured and am currently unable to perform at this level of physical demand."
good,"Answer incoming calls, sell cable packages, trouble shoot technical problems, credit accounts for error, and set up service calls. This was my first call center position and it was very different from face to face contact with the customer. I learn how distinguish the customer needs and supply them with product that we offered."
good,A typical day at work:
good,great place to work
good,"A typical day at Comcast would include highly aggressive sales team conducting outbound sales. Quotas were superseded because of the no nonsense appetite of the representatives. This was truly a money driven workplace. I have learned that creativity and psychology played in tremendously, making me one of the top sales representatives in the department. My skill allowed me to overtake the department record in excellence. Management was upbeat and kept a lively work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the unique style of each individual. The most difficult part of this position is the constant repetition, making it challenging to expand on a creative perspective."
good,"My experience at Comcast consists of multi-tasking answering inbound sales calls and emails for new and existing customers, as well as, billing and repair issues. My Team Lead is available for difficult situations or some escalations, but mostly it is an autonomous environment where I am empowered to make decisions for my business. My teammates/co-workers are both helpful and insightful. The hardest part of the job is the fact that every sale is not paid out even though the CAE may not have been at fault. I am very competitive and that makes me want to perfect my craft to avoid such mishaps. Conversely, the most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that for just doing my job I am able to earn performance based commission and spiffs, plus there is a Wii, about 40 tv's with every channel available(free pay-per-view), and a pool table."
good,"Every day was a high volume call day! The sales were great, supervisory team was great. The hardest part about my job was trying to sale internet to someone with out a computer. The most enjoyable part of my day was whenever we had free lunch."
good,Great small company for someone who likes customer manufacturing
good,"Overall, Comcast is great place to work. It has excellent benefits, paid flex time where I have never seen from another company. Vacation days and floating days in addition. It is a numbers enviroment. You do have to push yourself everyday to be a top performer. Sadly, our inbound sales department has been relocated to Plymouth, MI where it is now called ""Center of Excellence"" for Inbound Sales."
good,"Sales, Sales and more Sales was the attitude to have when performing a task at this job. Although it was competitive it was very rewarding and exciting career to have. The bonuses and incentives were the best to gain if the sales were correct. I enjoyed being apart of this sales family because everyone was striving to get the same thing...Money."
good,Harder worker i have learned a lot but its time to move on. I feel after a certain amount of time if you don't see yourself excelling anymore than what you should your time is up.
good,"oversaw two warehouses,12 people worked for me. learned a lot about people. hardest part was tracking cable converters."
good,"I enjoyed training new employees and customers on how everything worked. I loved the benefits and the friends I made. I did a lot of data entry, but I did not mind it."
good,• Role in 2011 DSR Commercial to advertise for career recruitment
good,comcast is a great place to work. employees are treated with respect at comcast and my boss was the best boss i ever had
good,I would say that they are constantly striving to become better. there are still policies that should be revamped but it is a work in progress.
good,its a great company for college students but for anything else is no
good,take incoming calls and help the customer with their individual issues billing or technical related
good,"If you like to work hard, this is a place for you. The atmosphere is great and you can succeed."
good,"I would usually take about 80+ calls a day from customers in the Pacific NW. I learned the basics of cable internet troubleshooting, and advanced video troubleshooting. Management was great and very supportive."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you want something different every day. Decent pay with incentive for field sales and upgrades. Hands on work makes for a quick and sometimes challenging day. Multiple advancement opportunities if you work hard at it. The management was often hired from the outside and didn't fully understand certain processes, and sometimes could not connect with the field technicians. HR was sometimes difficult to track down."
good,I learned a great deal in all 8 years with Comcast. It took me down many roadS of friendships and challenges. It was an overall great experience and I am now ready for my next big step.
good,"I've been with this company for the better part of two years. during my time here, I've come across my share of internal conflicts as well as the typical work gripes, but for the most part, it was a wonderful place to work. the benefits could be upgraded, but if you;re not too picky, you'll love what you get."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at comcast, I learned a lot about the direct sales and marketing business. I also learned about how to lead others and help them accomplish their goals."
good,A beautiful establishment very fun to work for love talking to customers and i love the benefits

good,"Comcast is a growing company, especially with the merger with NBC Universal. Many new and challenging opportunities are on the horizon for this company."
good,Good place to work at.. the people are nice.. bla bla bla bla bla
good,"A successful company with a strong corporate culture and values to guide you. An excellent compensation and benefits package. High stress, high paced environment prone to a lack of balance with your persona life. Advancement opportunity depends on willing to relocate or if currently in a major hub for the company."
good,Field sales with the objective of returning customers back to Comcast from the competition.
good,"Comcast is fast paced and highly competitive. I worked within the Call Center, which provided plenty of work, but was often repetitive. The upside was the ability to make commission sales on any call and hour long lunch breaks. The benefits provided were as well great."
good,I over all really enjoyed my employment with Comcast.
good,"Comcast cares about its employees, they are focused on career advancement.  Creating an exceptional customer service experience is of utmost importance."
good,"Knowledge Base"
good,I believe Comcast is a great company to work for. They invest in their employees and their is room to advance. If you advise management that you want to excel and work hard I believe you will be supported and achieve your goals.
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. Things started out very well. I made excellent progress but as managers get promoted and leave they took the happy work environment with them. The managers that stayed did not have the best attitude and made the place feel hostile. Consistently changing comp plans made for worse pay as time went on.
good,Good place to work until my location was closed and I had to travel 1.5 hours one way to work. This made life very hard on me with a 3 to 4 hour commute each work day with gas and other travel expenses  Toll and EZ pass lane charges with wear and tear on my vehicle.
good,I loved working for Comcast. I started on the phones takings Calls and moved my way up to an Interim Supervisor. I eventually applied and was promoted to a Supervisor. The best part was the people.
good,The pay and benefits are great. Meeting new people everyday on the job is fun. The work is pretty self explanatory and the vacation time is the best I have had at a job.
good,"Work with hard working good communication, great work environment, not enough hours, general accounting, journal adjusting entries, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable"
good,"Answering multiple calls a day with a variety of requests and problems to solve. The work is manageable but there are not wage increases to match the multiple increases to daily work. The people worked with are all very friendly helpful and willing to work and they are what make up the most enjoyable part of my job. "
good,The hardest part of my job is working with the trucking companies and vendors who provide us our supplies. The best part of my job is that our managers support our needs and listen to employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the team with which I work with on a daily basis. We enjoy working together to provide services to the business community.
good,"If you can not handle change, don't work here. Comcast has taken care of me and my family for many years. A lot of opportunity and support to learn and grow. Excellent benefits."
good,Various skills learned durng my 15 year career at comcast. Met great people and some great leaders that helped lead to my success with the company. IT is a great place to work. The team atmosphere is like no other comlpany i worked for.
good,"For the most part, fair. Customer abuse is high.  Benefit package is nice. Company quarterly bonuses, rather than holiday bonus - major high-five there. They’re doing well for a newer company."
good,The only constant thing at COMCAST is change. Like most large corporations it’s to be expected that there is always major changes here and there but it’s a company that strives for a streamlined procedure and experience across the board
good,"I believe Comcast offers a family atmosphere and it is what has made me loyal for 12 years. I am sad to leave the company due to the closure of a call center (upcoming on 12/14) which has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I, however, understand it is a business and sometimes decisions have to be made that affect the livelihood of employees, even those who have been with the company for a long time."
good,Comcast was a very fun environment to work at. Going to miss my job there after relocating our call center to Houston. I would have stayed but the current call center that they have here in MN was not my preference.
good,They have very good benefits and in general are a good employer! They offer a lot of good education and training as well as support in paying for education. They also offer leadership programs.
good,Comcast is a good place to work. Benefits are very good and the discounts on cable is amazing. The bad thing about Comcast is you are only treated as a number and not a person. Numbers that they want to hold you responsible for are at times out of your control.
good,"The culture at Comcast is great.  The leadership of the company is employee focused.  If they take care of their employees the employees will take care of the customer.  "
good,"Working for Comcast taught me i don't want to work for a large corporation. you don't feel like part of a company as much as you just feel as another cog in the machine"
good,Comcast is a productive and fast pace environment. Comcast offers advancement in all areas with-in all of Comcast's corporations. Comcast also offers 401-K match.
good,I happened to work in a great department. I am able to take my time and realy speak to the customer and help them. I am not pushed. I have all the tools i need to do my job. My team is great: we do pot lucks and celebrate birthdaya or happy news. Love my insurance.
good,"Had many benefits, hours were great,Staff was always helpful plus there are many people you have the pleasure of meeting through your tenure. There was a lot to sell and a large customer base"
good,I liked working here the staff was nice so were the managers great place for customer service experience the pay was also very good especially when you get your raise
good,"The challenge was knowing the current promotions and changes taking place. Things did not stay the same for very long. In a highly competitive arena, that is what you would expect."
good,"What can I say working at Comcast the hours were great you work four 10 hour work days and have 3 days off it was never 10 hours it was always 12 to 13 hours a day, and it was always plenty of overtime I will still be there if I was able to advance, I work hard everyday and when I ask for an advancement I was told I was not good enough, That's when I realized no matter how hard you work for this company you never good enough"
good,My typical work day consent of checking my emails before I start. I have learn to be more patient with people. The hardest party of my job is when someone call because they are having financial difficulties and there’s really nothing I can do.
good,If you don’t mind change come to Comcast. I had a great interview process. I would say get as much knowledge from the new hire training but expect to learn even more on the phones.
good,"Can be a stressful job depending on your job title. Strongly dislike the fact that the let us know they are discontinuing my job at the St. Paul Location and moving it strictly to Houston, TX only and making the St. Paul center a Loyalty center and from hearing at Comcast Loyalty is a more stressful position and I do not want to fight with a customer if they want to leave the company, other then that great benefits and discounts!!"
good,"This job served as my introduction to software engineering as an industry. It taught me much about proper version control and tricks to achieve it, programming standards, development in an agile environment, and more about developing as a professional. It made me realize how much I have to learn, as well."
good,"Great Company to work for, also many incentives and bonuses in addition to regular pay.  Education assistance is also part of the many benefits offered."
good,"Overall great business opportunity with encouraged growth opportunities.  It is stressful if you don't meet quotas, don't meet your metrics or receive negative customer surveys. Which can be unfairly attributed to the wrong employee. "
good,"Profepssional environment, great team work, lots of training which benefits us. Open door policy, gave lots of incentives for employees who performed or exceeded the goals"
good,"Great people, welcoming and helpful. Low starting wage, but if you are willing to do hard work and keep your metrix up to par. You should get a better wage in 3 years. Due to the amount of time you need to spend at that tech level."
good,"I have worked at a comcast call center for the past 2 years.  Hired at $14.91 hourly. 6 months later received a raise and that was increased to $16.18. Also if your shift starts at 12pm or later you receive and additional $1.50. We have quarterly bonues, get commission for sales, and huge discount on all services. Job can be really stressful though. Depending on your supervisor or manager it could be easy  to manage.  We are really pressured  to make  sales even though  the customer  is screaming at you  or complaining most of the time. You have to meet your metrics or be in danger or losing your job. If you aren"
good,"if this job offered more pay and paid Weekly, this would be the perfect job.Especially for the supply Chain Specialist position there You have 8 Jobs in 1 and get paid at the very very low end"
good,"I loved working at Comcast. Some of the Supervisors were phenomenal with awesome support, they truly took pride in their team and guiding you for the better of  the company and yourself.  Some Supervisors should have never been able to supervise a bird. This company truly supports growth. "
good,"Get to the office early to get into the warehouse to restock at 0745, at the same time management is pushing you to leave before 0745 thus not giving you time to prepare, expecting free off the clock work. The leadership is friendly with staff, favoritism is definitely at play. Getting promoted is not solely based on skill but on luck as well, there is a 0 excuse policy on metrics. Most of the internal branches of the company did not do a good job at communicating with each other, and very rarely did they all come together for a single common goal."
good,Comcast is a great company to work with good  work culture. Management is mostly technology savy and hands-on with deep industry knowledge.  There are some collaboration issues between teams.
good,The company itself is a good company to work for however things Chang often. The pay and commission is good but you do work hard most days   If you have a good management team it makes the job easier. The company needs to make changes within to make the retail job easier.
good,"brand new experiences every day. new customers, new opportunities, new entertainment. each job brought about its own challenges. never know what you're going to run into. between installs and troubleshooting, you had your work cut out for you; and it was your duty to ensure that the customer would have no issues as a result of your work (equipment issues were a different story). Maintaining professionalism was/is always a priority. Most enjoyable moments would be leaving the customer satisfied after completing a job well done."
good,"Currently turning the corner on innovation and customer experience.  Overall good products, excellent benefits.  Culture really depends on the organization that you're in."
good,"Great place to work. Depending on the office, unnecessary stress is put on techs. The benefits are great, home garaging, 4 day work weeks. Tremendous opportunity for growth."
good,"Arrive at the office around 10-11 and out in the field by 1."
good,"Comcast has excellent benefits and is a wonderful place to work, always room for advancement and growth.Excellent hours and days off and lots of overtime"
good,this is a nice extra income job because you are allowed to work from home. allowing you the flexibilty to complete other things that you mat have to do
good,"As an intern, your day starts with assigned tasks. You are given a specific problem to solve and have the full authority to take your decisions on how to approach the problem. The DC office environment is collaborative and you can walk up to anyone to discuss your idea and get suggestions or guidance. You are free to choose or working hours. More focus is on delivery than being in the office all day."
good,"The position that I was in really just was not the right fit for me, but the company treats their employees very well. Being a cable tech is a very physically and mentally demanding job - involving heights, ladders, basements, bugs and dirt just to name some things that were part of every house. Worse things were working in horrible weather and hoarder houses."
good,"Loved being a support tech with Xfinity. Helpping people solve there technical issues .  Of course you did get some rude people on the phone, but you got take the good with the bad."
good,Comcast is a great company for personal and professional growth.  They have excellent products on the B2B side that can compete against anyone.  Good group of professionals from CEO down.
good,Learned a lot. Must be self sufficient to succeed at the call center. Must be open minded. Fun place to work. Great managment staff. Great incentives and motivation.
good,"Good Place to work with dedicated employees, Good benefits and opportunity to advance your career. Fast paced environment very important to know how to build relationships with co-workers"
good,What happens at the start of the week is you set your schedule up from the previous weekend and then show the work in the Monday meeting. This gives you a great head start for the week. This is also how you determine what you want to make for the month by the amount of work and strategy to reach specific goals for the week. This was very lucrative toward great success.
good,"Great place to start a career in telecomunications. The pay is a bit low for the responsibilities employees have, and can be physically demanding. Benefits are great and you learn a lot about how a cable system works."
good,"My typical day to day work include but is not limited to analyzing emails that are send over to my department, escalating possible compromise unto the respective team and DE-risking comcast from any possible threats."
good,I enjoyed the fact that everyday on my job presented a different challenge. I met a lot of different people while working their and built numerous relationships because of it. I never really felt like I was at work because I enjoyed what I did and had fun while doing it. I thrived here because their was no manager on my back you had to be a self starter and properly manage your time to be successful.
good,Good place to work good training program way too many meetings.  Some of the management was very knowledgeable and other higher up managers had no clue How to do their own job
good,"Comcast is a great place to work and for anyone inexperienced or just getting out of college this is a place to really expand your skill set. "
good,"Comcast offers a great place to work and allows their people to take control of their own development and career path.  Due to the fast pace environment, its a sink or swim environment.  You can thrive just as long as you do not require much supervision and can build your own plan to succeed."
good,Each day was a new experience and a chance to learn how to help sales increase. Each customer was an opportunity to show how well we took care of our clients and their needs. It was always a team effort and help was everywhere when you needed it.
good,Comcast takes great care of its employees and there are tons of options for a career path. It is fast paced and reasonably paid. My typical day was managing frontline employees who directly assisted customers.
good,"Worked here during college and had a great time with the work staff. It was a tedious job, but all hospitality jobs are. Management and staff made it a great experience."
good,"Great work environment among the local sales team, big emphasis on work-life balance, team chemistry and collaboration in achieving company goals. Leadership is invested in growing associate talent and makes time to mentor individuals."
good,"Entry level call center positions are very structured. Pay is good for the level of skill required but as a sales rep it is still very much a customer service position. With the bad rap Comcast has, some customers can be difficult to deal with."
good,Good employer for a long time. Overall rating good. Compensation was good. Job security could have been better. Culture needs modernization. Benefits were great.
good,"It is a high-past setting in which you must use two screens to operate the profile of the client. You have to resolve the issues of their package being to high and expensive, accredit the client at your discretion, and protect the interest of Comcast, the Client, and my own Revenue Retained.  The system of which we use is highly complex and a learn as you go past and you either grasp the system or don't qualify after preliminary point.  I surpass the comprehension of the system and was able to help all many customers save a various amount of money on their bill monthly.  I also impacted revenue by adding additional lines and introducing Xfinity Mobile and helping in sales of their new Mobile Company.   "
good,Comcast is a great place to work. I would recommend it to anyone. They are forward thinking and generous with their employees.  They offer good benefits.
good,"Comcast is a huge company that has the benefits to extend wanted resources to employees. But it is a large company with big company demands: quotas, need for quick work, reports, et al. All in all, a great experience."
good,"Administrative Staff to General Manager, Office Manager, Marketing Manager, Technical Manager & Lead technicians.  Head End Input work, CSR coverage. Daily correspondence, Telephones, filing, etc."
good,"As a billing Rep.I felt right at home friendly staff and mangers guide you around any learning curves. The most enjoyable was tendering to a customer service just for them and eliminating costly unwanted add-ons. Short breaks, but nice break room."
good,"A typical day at at was made up of fellow employee interaction as well as problem solving and customer problems.  I learned something new just about every day about the company infrastructure."
good,challenging work; felt like part of the team; loved my job and all the responsibilities i was tasked with each day;   had many great bosses.  would have like to have retired with this company
good,"Great company to work for when you are younger.  Unfortunately, I have known too many who have been pushed out at a certain age.  After many years of no issues, suddenly the work culture changes to clean house and move the next generation in."
good,Day to Day work was great. I had great benefits and support. Every day was a different challenge which kept the job interesting and satisfactory. I believe that the culture has changed a little over the past couple years but top management handled it well. I loved working with my coworkers and had a lot of support in my duties.
good,good place to work with great benefits.  the culture was good and the options for growth were always present.  I would recommend Comcast as a great place to begin a career.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work and it is very fast past with an upbeat feeling. Their is a culture of family belonging. They offer the ability to learn different functions with the call center, Great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and pay for people who have no degree. Raises come quickly if you're good at your job. I went from . $12.35 per hour to $23.26 per hour base pay in a year."
good,It’s a great company but if you don’t want to do this as a career then it’s not going to be fun. They do take care of you but be prepared to work all of your days and you are able call out but come to work 100% of the time.
good,"The benefits make this job, though it's high paying enough that it barely needs them. The company is fine, the employees and supervisors are fine, the customers are largely unhappy and we're required to try to upsell every call so that got a bit awkward sometimes. Overall the goals were reasonable and the benefits were outstanding. If I hadn't moved to Florida, I would likely still be there."
good,"I believe if you put in the time and effort, you will be able to rise quickly at Comcast. It is a great place to work with many opportunities and great people to help you achieve your goals."
good,I worked there in the early 90's they were growing and adding content to sell every year.  Worked thru some growing pains when I was there so I can only assume things are still good there.
good,The work experience is not the best. The goal are way too high to achieve and then we get punished for it. Sometimes its over bearing when it comes to their goals.
good,benefits are excellent although a bit pricy. Pay can certainly be better but there is little to no overtime to offset low pay. you do get a discount on cable and internet
good,"Comcast Business is a good place to work. It is a call-center, but it is a very collaborative environment, where we are encouraged to help each other. Management is very approachable and supportive. Benefits are good, and the company treats the employees well. The only draw-back is the low starting salary, but bonuses are offered on a quarterly basis."
good,"With comcast, the work you put in is what you get out of it. It's actually a good place to work. As long as you like sales. The commission is pretty good, I average around 1100 dollars for commission and thats just me, not some top performers. The only downside for me would be the inconsistent scheduling."
good,"This is a technology company plain and simple.  While cable may not appear high tech, all of the products Comcast offers are exceptional and provide for an awesome customer experience. The management teams are second to none and have a commitment to making sure the customer has a great experience but they also make sure the employee is cared for.  I would highly recommend Comcast as a place to work."
good,"Good work environment, some supervisors played favorites. The people that worked there are mature. The training has slipped and gone downhill. They need to work on the training for people because people come onto the floor and dont have all the training they could have gotten."
good,Great company awesome opportunities. Schedule's could be a lo better in the Horsham office. GREAT Perk to Walt Disney a host of other discounts and resources.
good,"The company is organized well, and provide many different ways to learn and advance. People are always willing to help you if they have time. There are a lot of ways to relax and a lot of free food is offered."
good,Takes dedication to the job but it will pay off! The job is ever changing but the team work is great! We like to help each other advance and learn. The people make the job great!
good,Sales position is fine and possible to make money but not everyone does and it will have a big turnover.  It is a very small base and then your money comes with commission.  Have to try to get money from everyone .  As much as you can even if there elderly to make any decent living.
good,I work for Comcast for almost 20 years it was a great place to work had lotta good friends and very knowledgeable and my work from alarm systems to installing cable customers home with equipment touch as modem and cable boxes
good,"I loved my time at Comcast however as a father of two boys and a husband, being the sole provider for the home, my $15.95/hr was not paying the bills."
good,"Comcast was a great place of employment for me when I was 22 and looking for just a job. They shaped me into looking for a career. I matured a lot from working at Comcast, I had a lot of great mentors and peers that provided valuable guidance to me in my younger years. Comcast put a lot of things into perspective and provided a lot of growth opportunities to me in my younger years. They provided a very competitive salary and as long as you worked for it. I became professionally mature and learned a lot of lessons that i still carry with me and repeat to others til this day!."
good,"Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. Your outlook is pretty much the thing that carries you. Daily and weekly goals are realistic, some managers need more training"
good,I enjoyed my time there even though my last manager was pretty toxic.  A lot of opportunity for growth and advancement for those that put in the effort.
good,Great Place to work if you like Sales.  I started in the collection department - Loved my job.  Collections moved to Utah which left SALES in the call center.  Sales wasn't for me but gave it a good 5 years
good,Best company in my experience. Better benefits than the healthcare field. Pay is fair. Deeply discounted services. Job is stressful. Commission is decent.
good,"Family oriented work environment, with many opportunities for advancement. Competitive enough to keep employees putting there best foot forward at all times."
good,"I appreciate the experience, knowledge, and wisdom I gained there. I got to learn about how to provide an excellent customer experience. I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a solid career in customer service."
good,"Good job with a good salary but it can be dangerous at times. Depending on the weather conditions,especially in the winter, it can make the job difficult and dangerous because of the ice, snow, and subzero temperatures."
good,"work from  home is so convenient for job work/life balance. education benefit and personal benefits such as health benefits is very good along with discounts on the company's products that allow us first hand knowledge education , making it easy to speak to the products to our cusstomers"
good,Comcast/Xfinity is a great place to work. It is very competitive in the sales department with different monthly incentives on top of your hourly and commission pay.
good,"As a high school student, it was easy money and required no actual thought to the job. As an adult, they probably couldn't pay me enough to get yelled at by strangers over the phone again. I'm sure the environment has changed in the last ten years, but I'm not willing to go back."
good,"As a Supervisor with Comcast, I can be enjoyable and rewarding. Being a call center sup, it is very stressful to accomplish daily task if you are not organized in your daily routine. "
good,"Comcast is a great place to work with plenty of development opportunities. The people who work at Comcast give it a family feeling, because everyone is eager to work towards the common goal of supporting the customer."
good,I worked really hard to get this job and I love it . The only possible issue is if you get a sup that doesn't like you it can be very bad and Comcast more stands up for there sups more than anything.
good,"As the Ad Sales division of Comcast, the average working was fast paced and often included travel. You learn a lot about a variety of business as you analyze the advertising needs. Best of all, delivering a winning ad plan is very gratifying and likely to build long-term revenue."
good,"As a CAE, you learn all aspects of the company.  A little IT, sales and retention. It all boils down to customer service.  As long as you had a support team that would help you out when you got on a hard call, you would be fine.  You have to be compassionate yet quick.  If you get a customer off the phone to fast, they would call back, which is bad for you.  The company does keep track of how many calls you take and how many of them call back.  They want you to satisfy the customer to the point that they will not have to call back, especially for the same problem."
good,It was a great place to work it would have been awesome if got a little more pay. I had great teammates a super supervisor and much encouragement. Miss there. Very much

good,"refurbish cable boxes and all accessories for the operation of boxes, Very friendly employees. It was an easy job with a nice steady work pace. A lot of fun to work there at time."
good,Good career based company with opportunity to advance within. Advancement is not only possible but encouraged throughout all departments. Tools and education are available to all employees regardless of initial skill sets.
good,I enjoyed my time at Comcast and have lots for friends who work for them. I left because a of a bad Director who treated managers with disrespect and took credit for their work.

good,"I like the location and company.  Good people.  Good salary."
good,Routing was hectic. Dispatch varied. Time on jobs were never enough for big installs. No plans in place if someone called in sick. You just got more work.
good,"The company offered great benefits such as discounted cable, internet, and phone services for employees. The VP was disconnected from work force and displayed no compassion or interest in maintaining a healthy work environment with his reports. When my managers started walking away, I knew that this was a problem and I subsequently found new employment elsewhere."
good,"This is a very lucrative place to work if you are a good salesman. The employees are nice and the hours are great! The only problem that I had Was when my hiring manager was replaced, his replacement was never really involved in the day to day operations. Other than that, it was a good place to work."
good,"There are always opportunities for advancement given the size of the org.  Corporate and business unit management is outstanding, always high-performing and looking for the best and brightest."
good,"I work from home for them and they are pretty easy going, flexible. Since I work from home I don’t receive benefits. I don’t work directly for Comcast, I work Through a vendor."
good,There was always plenty to keep you busy at Comcast. I enjoyed the teams that I worked with. They are always trying something new to try to improve customer service.
good,"I learned a lot about the telecommunications business, specifically on the business service side.  The people were great and we had a great team.  Like any large organization, change is constant."
good,"great team members "
good,Every day requires for a new technological challenge. It is a really fun job. Helps people to grow and discipline themselves. Customer experience is always a funny thing to find.
good,they let go over 300 employees without any warning...showing that  most any position can be eliminated without any concern for there staff   in todays world
good,Great place to work great benefits and you get to get a lot of discount on their products. My favorite one is the curtesy service. They give you a truck to take home
good,"Through Delran builders we performed upgrades to Comcast office buildings and other various facilities. The jobs were fast-paced with tight budgets. Although, there was plenty of work due to there extensive network of facilities."
good,Made good money while sales were available.  Good sales experience.  Upped my technology experience.   Communicated and met with people from all walks of life.  I had many classes to update product knowledge
good,"This job wasn't bad, however during training you can't leave for ANY reason, not even if a grandparent dies unexpectedly... which was my case, they didn't honor it."
good,"I have been with this company for over 10 years and it has been rewarding and satisfying. I need to begin work in the Behavioral field otherwise, I would stay"
good,"The benefits is what really attracted me to this job. Fathers get 3 months paid at 100% to be with their new born child. That there is really cool. Also, benefits now start on DAY ONE. You get ample vacation time out of the gate which is really cool as well. But, unfortunately with good comes the bad. Though it isn't the worst I've seen but the commission structure could be a lot better. Given that its non union they can make whatever change they want to your pay. Personally feel the people at the top have no clue what's going on at store level."
good,Great place to interact with customers and grow your career. Managed accounts and provided insight on products. Management at my location was very professional and calculated.
good,I worked in an office environment in particular on the call center floor. I installed computers and laptops for the comcast employees and supervisors.
good,"It was a challenging job, I loved my supervisor and manager. All my coworkers were great and all did their job. That wasn't always the case, but in the end I worked with a great bunch of people. We had a great job talking with techs all day, managing outages, managing impairments, talking on the phone, and troubleshooting. Hardest part of the job was storm days, when we had a lot of damage, and the hardest day was when we all got laid off."
good,Great benefits with the free cable and internet. Lots of room for advancement or just lots of room to work in a different area or one of the many projects
good,if the pay was better... the place would be a whole lot better. I enjoy my coworkers and we work well together. but the people complain mostly about the pay
good,Comcast is a good place to work.  You get lots of perks for working for company.  It is a very competitive work place and requires you to often push a product onto a customer just so that you can make a sale.
good,Great place to work the schedule are rough the supervisors are informative and I can't complain I just want a better shift the products are awesome the environment is great because of the changes that are going on so this is a great company
good,Comcast is a fast moving environment. Ideal candidates must be change agents. Fun and Exciting place to work with a very diverse employee base. Senior Leadership is visible and accessible.
good,"It is a great place to work, just the growing after 3 acquisitions has stifled morale. It is a constant change with no solid working conditions for about 8-12 months in the foreseeable future."
good,"Great company to work for.  I transferred from a different state which paid more than Georgia so instead of downgrading my pay, they provided training for a better, more technical position...on top of free cable (every single channel) free internet (the highest speed) and discounted home phone svc and pay per view movies and events"
good,"Working at Comcast provided employees with the opportunity to work within a :high-speed"", ""low-drag"" environment that was conctantly evolving due to the companies existince within the telecommunications, content, and cable programming vertical."
good,"Good company to work for overall I just wanted to do something a little different, I chose not to be on the phones anymore to try another venture which was fun while it lasted"
good,"On a daily I would spend time with my coworkers and management in meeting for the first half, Just to prepare for the day, Grab materials and pick our territories. we ate lunch as a unit and worked as a unit. If someone was done, we were there to pick each other up. There is growth for advancement but you have to put in the time and work. Benefits and discounts are also a plus when it comes to having a family."
good,"At this job, like with many CSR roles, you must be ready to act on the spot, take on the challeging requests with a smile, and find an ease to deliver your sales."
good,Working at Comcast was ok and interesting alot of stress to maintain sales and competition with other areas of the company. got to be very stressful. and i ended up getting a job in another state. My supervisor was great and a great manager.
good,I would have loved to stay with Comcast as a permanent employee in a better department. I was only contracted to work there. I don't have a lot to explain about the job.
good,"Assisted customer base via telephone with reception problems, internet connection problems, billing questions, sales of promotional products and services."
good,I have made life long connections at this company.  I really enjoy the collaborative relationships and the open door policy I feel like I have a voice and am not just a number.
good,"On a typical workday I would complete on average at least 8 or more service calls. Service calls raging from trouble calls,activation,disconnects,and customer education. I enjoyed keeping up with the technology as well as leaving satisfied customers after resolving the issues. Everyday was another day to learn something new about troubleshooting issues. RF issues, downstream,upstream, as well as troubleshooting and finding leaks that cause ingress."
good,great place to work management very thoughtful and helpful. High energy workforce and very helpful employees and management. This is accompany with cutting edge technology. But you have to be willing to relocate when opportunity presents itself.
good,"I was great starting at first. But very stressful. Once you ease in to the flow, things get easier and much more relaxed. After a couple months you start to feel unaccomplished or empty. The atmosphere as far as friends and co-workers go is amazing but working with customers can take a toll."
good,"Great place to make a lot money, provided you are wiling to work extra hours and go the extra mile. "
good,"Hard to advance in a company, paid training, good benefits, good managers, paid time off, flex days, discounts, work van, supplied tools, uniforms, free cable and internet"
good,"Opportunity to learn each day. Technologies used were latest.  You can see people having knowledge in expert levels."
good,Loved my teammates and the management enjoyed the corporate events. Learned new skills gained experience from others while working together in team meetings.
good,Had to jump through hoops to get any help or to be able to help another technician out on the job. work load not spread out evenly among st technicians.
good,"They give you part of the work tools, you rent the Van, but I had to pay the gasoline. In short it is a good company, with benefits, but the salary is low."
good,Great work life balance.  Collaborative and team environment. Great Management.  Great room for growth and promotion. Competitive Salaries and benefits.
good,"A typical day at work would be dispatched from home traveling to several residents to assess problem with service and install new service.At this company I learned cable installation and fixing service and the way it works from headquarters to the customers home.Management was very professional and well organize, worked great with employees.hardest part was the hours.Most enjoyable was making the customer happy"
good,Knocking door to door hoping to spark conversation with a person or family hoping to satisfy their daily needs within the household via cable and or internet
good,"Comcast Spotlight, the advertising sales division of Comcast Cable Corp. provided good benefits, required courses in diversity and harassment, and asked for feedback from employees which were used to guide the company."
good,"The day begins with check in at headquarters. Then dispatch provides your work load for the day. As the day continues you work with the provided list of job assignments and complete them. Troubleshooting challenging sites take more time but I was always successful with completing those. Due to this I was provided with the call backs or jobs that were a challenge to other techs. As time went one I only received call backs then Commercial job sites as well.  This became a challenge due to the dispatchers want to have as many call backs completed . I was completing on average a day 6 to 7 call backs a work day. My time would extend well beyond my regular working hours. However, I enjoyed working on challenging sites and gained personal growth from successfully providing the service that the customer requested despite the number of individuals that were unable to do so."
good,"Work 9 am till around 8 pm every day. Worked weekends when behind quota. Learned leadership skills, learned how to learn about peoples issues and ask the right questions to get the answers I needed. The original environment was up beat and lively and created motivation. New environment is very individual and not lively anymore."
good,Overall great company and product to work for.  Corporate pitfalls and possibility of corporate structure changes make long term career difficult to have full confidence in.
good,"After a few years contracting at Apple, where we contractors were never included in anything (at least in the group I worked in), it seemed very inclusive at Comcast Silicon Valley. We contractors were even allowed to dine with the employees at the free lunches provided every Tuesday and Thursday."
good,"Daily meetings, team performance and metric reviews, however relaxed atmosphere yet metric driven. You had to perform to meet the monthly metrics. Management can do a better job of encouraging work-life balance and celebrate wins."
good,"Great place to work if you are comfortable with an ever changing environment. Sales floor was competitive, but mainly to out do your own best. Leadership is helpful with career advancement and incentives."
good,I am in sales so I work in the field working door to door working to generate sales. phone on 24/7 to answer customers calls for cable installation and sales
good,The Job requires hard work to be successful.  Very rigid management systems.  Comcast spends a tremendous amount of money and time on training.  The benefits are very good.  Management is erratic in their decision making.
good,"Overall not so bad, but some days can be very stressful. As a cable tech sometimes you will get overbooked and rushed from job to job. Not paid enough."
good,It was a great company to work for. They spare no expense for training and the culture around the workplace was very positive. Great salary and commission structure is truly unlimited.
good,"Door to door sales can be taxing physically , but while you are up to it, it is fun and rewarding, the people that I worked were great and Comcast prepares you for the job."
good,"Comcast was a great place to work, when ever I had ideas they listened and they push you to bring those ideas to light, you meet great people working there, the only issues I ever had was the stressful phone calls and my scheduled work hours and its why I left but overall Comcast is a great starter job with great benefits."
good,Work at the current location is slow paced and moving towards cloud.  Most of the apps are built a long time ago and monolith. Apps are now slowly moving towards latest tech.
good,My typical day includes performing system maintenance and checking for outages. Often times I am called upon to  view our pending trouble call list and prepare a report of the findings. The work culture is pretty steady. Our duties include ensuring proper connectivity for the Headend all the way to the customers terminal.The hardest part of my job is noise mitigation.
good,"I have worked for Comcast over 5 years and love my job.  I am a Store Manager (multi - unit).  It is a very busy, fast paced job.  I enjoy the constant changes."
good,"During my time here it was a good place to work, i moved on to do better things. I still have friends there and seems like management has changed for the worse."
good,"my managers and colleagues for their unending support and guidance. I am taking along skills, valuable lessons and experiences that has helped me evolve personally and professionally"
good,"During a typical work week, one of my tasks is checking in on my staff to make sure they all have their turf  and updated promotion sheets and  I like to meet first thing on Monday to discuss our"
good,"Comcast paid me very well ($80k/year) until they raised the quota for sales bonuses which was based on the top 10% off reps- the thing is, these top 10% of reps were, for the most part, flat out cheating the system to get the bonus.  I even went to HR with my supervisor's supervisor, but was unfortunately unable to prove the cheating- but it was obvious- as a retention rep it's impossible to have a 100% ""save rate""- people move, people die, so how can other reps have a zero customer loss on their balance sheets? I'll tell you, THEY LIE and report every customer as a ""saved"" customer. Very frustrating to have my pay cut from $80k to $45k based on these blatant LIES!"
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for. There are a lot of changes within the call center environment, which can be stressful to people who work there."
good,"It was a stressful jobs, would have to handle alot of upset callers. "
good,"Contractors were routinely furloughed during holidays.  Good manager and workplace.  Challenging projects and good recognition  "
good,"This job started of great , Comcast is a great company and overall changed my life for the better. the recent change in the commission structure is the reason I am not 100% happy. The money is good and the ability to make more money is there but I would prefer to make a living with out my pockets being played with quarterly"
good,"Was there for many years, had to relocate to a non-comcast area for personal reasons. Overall a good company to work for. Like anything else they were extremely metric drives."
good,"Great staff, quick pace, and amazing benefits.  This job started as a contract to implement a set of services inside an integration environment.   Comcast provided training on several technologies and other incentives."
good,"Very good place to work and learn - As long as you keen on learning new technologies and concepts, you will be satisfied to work here. It is giant and leading communication industry, no doubt."
good,"great company to work for, they strive on constant change which can be amazing but you never truly know what is the correct procedure sometimes with this method. Can make the already fast paced, high call volume, metric meeting environment that much for stressful. They offer amazing benefits, and discounts on their products."
good,"The pay at Comcast used to be great, but now that has changed and it has become a micro managed environment with a huge cut in salary, while the benefits remain the same."
good,"upbeat, supportive environment, and fast paced."
good,"Day to day is hard, there will be days where you just want to go home and no deal with customers but as technician you are driving the companies success or failure depending on the type of tech you are (you guys know who you are). Techs fixes everything even the the mistakes from sales department This is why it astonish me that techs with comcast are the most underrated job."
good,room to grow if you assert yourself.  It is a fast paced atmosphere where you can make what ever you want for yourself. I started out in the call center and ended up as a sr. director
good,"installation of XH and internet anywhere from College Park to Buckhead. Provided company truck, the overall culture is good i just think we are underpaid for what we do on an everyday bases"
good,"•	Interact daily with customers, maintained high standards of customer service during high-volume"
good,"You could not ask for better  other benefits...Great benefits. Employees all work together."
good,"It is very difficult to provide for your family with the salary at Comcast. While there are perks and benefits, your potential for growth is quite limited."
good,Comcast is cool work environment and it specializes in a supportive management style given the stressful atmosphere of customer service. I would recommend Comcast to friends as a great job
good,"Comcast is the leader in the Philadelphia Market, great opportunity for growth and income. Advancement is possible with consistent training provided by Comcast."
good,"At my time in Comcast, it was great and a lot of teamwork. There are times that were stressful but working together things got done. When company decided to change management, things went downhill. Teamwork disappeared and it was like every person for themselves, I still believe it still going on to this day."
good,"things change fast, so must be able to keep up. fun culture but stressful job. best thing about the job is the benefits. best benefits i have seen with any company thus far"
good,"Positive place to work , exceptional benefits.  Management  listens to workers concerns to create an overall balance of work and getting the job done."
good,"Comcast is a place to where they leave it up to you for you to succeed or fail, training is great and the pay is awesome. You also have a great chance for promotion as long as you put the work in and follow the guidelines they have set for you."
good,The atmosphere is very open and people are very helpful. It's a nice place to learn new technology as well networking stuff. It's always tricky to convince upper management and ComCast is no different.
good,"Fast paced , lots of overtime . No job security, point system , flexible hours if needed . Stressful supervisor postions. Very nice human resource personell , paid training 10.50 Hr 4-6 weeks"
good,"Stressful but eventful and compelling. High energy job with good co-workers. Always strived for excellence, and the overall workplace culture was good."
good,Enjoyed the job while it lasted. No complaints really. All about wether you have a good sup or not that’ll determine if the job will be hard. Some sups and managers can be a pain (I’ve seen it before). Also time off through Sedgwick can REALLY be a pain. That’s the suckiest part of the job. No other complaints.
good,"I worked for Comcast for 14 years.  When I left I wasn't making nearly what the market would have dictated someone in my position as an Analyst for 10 years would make.  When it's mentioned in an eNPS meeting, it's ""taken in to consideration"".  HR re-evaluates but the outcome is usually a title change.  Work/life balance, benefits, PTO etc are awesome.  They need to pay accordingly."
good,Fast pace work environment.  Always strive to become more efficient and improve the customer experience.  The company has a wide range of employment opportunities to grow and advance.  There is a family culture within or work group.  There is constant change which keeps the job fresh and new but can also cause some concern for individuals that have issue with change.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Comcast, i most certainly appreciated all of the improvements they were making to ensure a better work environment. My supervising team were very helpful as well as dedicated to career growth and development."
good,"Comcast is a large company and everything that goes with that.  Great benefits, great systems and products.  Things could move at a glacial pace at times, but welcome to a corporation.  I enjoyed working there."
good,"It's a great opportunity to make a lot of money. Odd hours and the required field times, brings challenges to work/life balance.Work in the suburbs and stay away from Chicago, the taxes make sales difficult."
good,"Busy job. Great Benefits, pay is ok. The business Department is were you want to work. Residential is stressful. Management is really good. Customer service is number one priority"
good,the job have good pay and benefit but no room to grow if you're looking for a career. the first two managers were really good when you need problem resolve but the last  one only want to hide from customer and not  want to resolve any customer issues/complaints.
good,"being handle  a call center, all open hours had to be covered to handle customers in timely manner.  Made for difficult time schedules and scheduling time off.  Company pushed sales as much if not more than customer service.  Very difficult goals to reach."
good,"I really enjoyed working for and with Comcast. There was room for growth, elevation, and stability. If I had the proper schedule that I could work with I would still be apart of the team."
good,My day would start at the office going in for a morning meeting in Lakeville Ma. Had to get all my materials ready to do my job throughout the day. Throughout the day had to go to customers houses to install cable and troubleshoot.
good,"Overall, you can make a very decent fair salary working at Comcast Cable. The benefit pkg including health and free cable/internet is also awesome! Of course every dept is different, but you do have the opportunity to work your way up and most managers are very helpful."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. Constant changes in the commission structure lower moral and confidence of the employees. The immediate feeling of success when you obtain your goal, complete a sale or provide excellent customer service is what drives you."
good,I really enjoyed working for Comcast. They had the best sales training that I've experienced.  They also have alot of perks...like free cable and deep discount.  The pay structure is very nice and they often had bonuses.
good,"Load equipment.maybe 60-70 pieces of equipment wires,cables, terminators tool belt full strippers, crimps,color coded tages ,purple,white,pink,I'll have 6 to 8 houses or apts who are scheduled for installation may consist of climbing a pole to reach your tap,or to install one"
good,A typical work day is very busy and congested. installing customer's services and repairing them is nit hard when you got the hang of it. The culture in the office is relaxed and chill.
good,"Routed techs, assisted with equipment, made contact customers .  Worked on area issues with outages.  Assigned to tech cleared outages and called customers."
good,"Typical day at work starts at about 8:00 am"
good,Building Data Centers around the USA has been a blast.  Looking for my next opportunity.  If it weren't about having to relocate I would love to stay right where I'm at.
good,"overall I enjoyed the culture"
good,I enjoyed my time there. My supervisor was the best and he helped me whenever it was needed! It was very competitive but the incentives were awesome. Discounts were the perk!
good,Very Busy enviroment. Very stressful great Supervisors. Vacations compensate with years of Service to the company. Good training throughout your career there.
good,I liked this job but could not hire back in the same place as when I left. Training is good and the pay and benefits are decent. Management was good and helped out often .

good,"Typical day receiving approx. 75 inbound calls for service."
good,"I must say that I enjoyed my journey with Comcast. If I could have continued it, I would have. The area I moved to was not in Comcast Blueprint. My experience was great. I worked over 16 years and started out as a rep on the phones. As time progressed, I was able to move up the ladder in various departments/positions all the way up to Management. I enjoyed the team and leadership I worked for and the journey was great. I miss Comcast but change is good."

good,"A typical day in this role was very fast paced to complete your orders, but this took away from the TLC customers require.   Management did not listen to anyone's feedback on the process."
good,Great Place to start a career. Opportunities to move up but very competitive. The benefits are great as well as the culture of the company. Salary is fair but would like to see higher raises.
good,"Comcast was a great company to work for.  In my opinion, I just had a bad manager that was concerned that I would take his job due to my qualifications.  The work environment was fantastic, the people were very helpful and there was a lot of cross function work.  I would recommend them to anyone"
good,"Comcast although is not the most reputable company, They are a great place to work for. Management and employees are very professional, as well as close and personable. I have made great relationships with multiple people in this company. The fluctuation in the commission structure has caused me to look for other work. It is a great place to work for a 2 income household. My situation requires me to find more stable compensation."
good,everyday work is steady. the daily process is fixing and maintaining the progression of the plant to provide proper services to our customers. weather plays a factor.
good,Comcast is  a great company. Comcast provides great benefits and a good work life balance fro it's employees.  Comcast provides lots of opportunities for it's employees to learn and grow.

good,"At Xfinity I was responsible for promoting and selling Comcast products and services that are both current and emerging, and approach sales as a way of helping customers receive the best value for their money. I also had to be able to communicate effectively and display a professional and positive demeanor."
good,Decent pay and good benefits.  This company seemed to care about their employees and had a good PTO plan.  The compensation level was not quite where I wanted to be.
good,They have great benefits! You'll be successful if you meet your goals no matter how unattainable they seem. When everything was local the company overall was a lot better. Customers seemed much happier.

good,every team and staff member makes it a fun and enjoyable work place to be in. Its not jus work were more like family. the supervisors and managers are very good leaders. and the compensation is a plus.
good,"if you are looking for great pay and good benefits and hard work then this would be a good job for you. constantly working in the weather even if its raining,snowing, hot outside"
good,"I have been at my company for three years now and have learned a lot from working with some amazing salespeople.  I worked my way up to regional sales manager 18 months ago and my region has beat our sales projections by at least 25% each quarter since. However, I am starting to feel like I need some new challenges. This position really appeals to me because it would allow me to manage a bigger team and sell more innovative products.”"
good,"A lot of customer interaction over the phone.  I learned how to use the system to provide great customer service.  The hard part was dealing with some irate customers.  The office was busy, reminding you of a call center environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I was able to help people understand their bill, or resolve a problem.  They offer opportunities to increase your income through sales of services as well."

I resigned due to burnout but I will not stop or say anything negative because I was able to buy my first car while working there and to be quite honest I actually want to go back because I felt I made somewhat of a difference"
good,"Great Place to start a career, use a bridge to achieve a greater goal or just to make some money as you're trying to figure it all out! Great pay and benefits."
good,"com-tech, specialize in ensuring customers recieve the highest quality of enjoyment with comcast products. i troubleshoot and install internet, cable, phone and home security."
good,Constantly changing.  The company is going through lots of changes and introducing new products.  Work/Life Balance is getting to be a bit of a struggle.  There are courtesy services that are a plus.
good,"Sales and billing calls, one on one sales reviews and peer to peer coaching. I learned a lot their products and services and how to build relationships with new and existing customers."
good,"Advancement in the company is available. Commission can vary, but steady. Management is not micro managed, and supervisors are generally nice. Always have giveaways and spiffs. Company also does a lot to give back to the employees."
good,"Great job, the benefits are awesome. The salary is  great, you are compensated well. The job isn't hard, I loved it. You get to meet great co-workers and come across tons of people over the phone whom you seem to make great interactions with."
good,I feel if you can work in a fast pace office this would be the job for you. Very competitive when it comes to commission and different opportunities. Give it a shot.
good,"i loved my time as an employee at Comcast.  if you stay away from gossip, etc, you can advance very quickly.  They try to recognize good employees constantly by giving bonuses, prizes, even time off.  The benefits are good and they give you basically free cable, internet,  and phone so you can enjoy their product and also be familiar with all their services(2 cable boxes are free and you pay if you want additional).  i developed life long friends and contacts for life   The only reason that i left is because i had a more lucrative opportunity with another company.  however, if the opportunity presents itself, i would go back in a heart beat"
good,"Call center environment, must be able to sale products.  Management is available to help you grown, and coach along the way. There is room to grow in the company, leadership supports promotions."
good,Work days vary and never get boring. Day to day tasks may change and generally do depending on the fires that need to be fought. I learned a lot about the cable industry and how they are competing with the massive internet streaming services. The management at Comcast is mediocre. Some managers are very qualified and some you might wonder how they ever got into management. The work place culture was great for me as I was working on the X1 platform. Lots of people were giving their all to create an extremely desirable product in terms of technology and design. The hardest part about the job is trying to keep everyone in the matrix organized team aligned in terms of company goals. The most enjoyable part about the job was definitely some of the great people I had the opportunity to work with.
good,"The company is wonderful as far as coworkers go, not much interactions with management. The job is had but rewarding. Had a lot of fun working here. Great pay."
good,Comcast has a lot of upward mobility at first but the quickly dies out if your unwilling to travel far and wide. They also expect you to do the same work that other local companies do for a les pay;
good,"At a local level, Comcast was great to work for, Sups and management was great to work under, but being a tech, you certainly feel like you're at the bottom of the totem pole."
good,Very good place to learn.. Management needs to outline a path direction for their employees. Other than that the people are great and easy to work with. Most people know there work
good,"its a great company to work for in terms of benefits and pay, but sometimes customers tend to be a little hostile. management is usually pretty good in helping the subordinates in achieving results. hardest part of the job would probably be accommodating to the outside environment or even attics as the dangers of heat stroke are very real. but the most enjoyable part is knowing you did high quality work and resolved the customers issues. also expect to wait  a few months after sending in a application to even get started at Comcast since usually they have 3 different interviews to do before even going to training."
good,Comcast is a great place to work as long as u dont gwt stuck in a department that is already messed up before u get there and everybody is held to the same rules and regulations
good,"Good company if you like to talk with people all over united states, has good pay and good hours, benefits are good but not the best, and management was good. however comcast is not known to be a good company. customers are 70% mad."
good,Large growing company with great benefits and reasonable compensation. Valuable customer relationship building opportunity with many opportunities for growth.
good,"The attendance policy is fair. The job culture is outstanding. The pay is great. Im not going to lie, its stressful because people are so rude but the company itself is great."
good,I was accept on the team and enjoyed going to work every day with the group of Co-workers it was a Family atmosphere.  Loved learning new things everyday and helping my team be successful.
good,"Overall great company, love the atmosphere, learned active listening skills. Typical day at work, answer phone and provide assistance to all customers. Go into meetings every now and then to see if we can better improve ourselves as individuals and as a company. Management is very accommodating and the leadership team is great. Every co-worker is friendly and very hands on with helping. Hardest part of the job is to accommodate every customer with what is needed. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you have fully helped a customer and they had a good experience."
good,"Comcast Spotlight is a great place to work with great benefits, and great people. It's currently going through a corporate restructure that is taking a toll on some employees, but overall, it is still a great place to work."
good,The worst part of the job was that managers did not want to see their employees advance. I felt a lot of discrimination going on but I continued to show up everyday and do my job.
good,"This company stays, forever changing and stays on the cutting edge of the new ideas/products in telecom. From Telephone to video and High speed internet"
good,"This is an inbound call center assisting customers with billing questions and request for additional products and services.  The work environment here is wonderful in a word.  This is an uplifting, skills and confidence building place to work with great opportunity to grow.  "
good,I enjoy working as an overnight customer service and sales professional. I had a great manager to assist me at all times. I provide technical assistance and billing assistance to customers calling in.
good,"Working 10 hr shifts, 4 days a week is nice. Supervisors are helpful and tend to be somewhat caring. Overall not to bad to work, just be even tempered and calm with customers."
good,"Comcast is a great company, but the hours were conflicting with my home life. I've gained a lot of knowledge with computers, and customer service experience while working for this company."
good,"Impressed with Comcast investment in technology and advancing their staff. Culture is challenging as in any technology company with many brilliant minds and objectives. As with most companies, the people make it worth overcoming any and all challenges."
good,Great opportunity for growth and new technologies. Not very hard to get along with other employees. parking lot is really tight and not enough conference rooms.
good,"Good environment and good people. Call center based job, Really good benefits. Always going to have a nice team and management. Training is really thought out."
good,This is one first jobs that i learned being in professional environment..Variety of different cultures..Management was a good team. i say the hard part of the job was the customers and up scaling a product..
good,"Large call center environment, fast paced managing lar teams of account representatives. Fast changing technical environment in which always learning the latest in  television, entertainment and cable technology. The best employee benefits."
good,Continually growing and evolving company provides 'never a dull moment' employment.  In my 10+ years employment with this company I have seen the new products and technologies introduced time and time again and have seen the company acquire a number of entertainment outlets.  The workplace is fast paced and ever changing.
good,They have classes to help get started most of the managers help the associates figuring problems out lunches brakes time off is done by phone once a week meetings and stock pickup how you stalk your own van and get supplies on hand
good,"Deadlines up until 10am everyday."
good,"Answer incoming calls regarding customer’s bill"
good,"Great place to work with good beneftis. The management could always improve. The work hours are doable if you get a good shift. Being a top performer, it was very attainable to pick my shifts. You must be a go getter and self motivated to want to succeed."
good,"fun place to work, comes with many perks, but people can sometimes be selfish. It is very interesting to see how tv stations work and how such a big communications company functions. Got to meet a lot of TV celebs also. Very slow in updating technology. Managers are very unorganized."
good,Getting services for 95% off is awesome.  The commission is helpful however it's done based on a month of performance and overall isn't that substantial.
good,"Great company to work for. Tons of career advancement opportunities. The benefits are fantastic and its fun place to work at."
good,The trainers are helpful. Most of the supervisors are professional. The work itself can be stressful at times but rewarding and the support is strong for newcomers.
good,"I enjoyed working with Comcast and learned a lot of skills, perfect technology and advanced equipment "
good,"A typical day would be coming in and signing onto my computer, answering calls all day to promote services and help solve account issues customers may have. I have learned a new CSG system for customer accounts and to read billing info as well as coding. All of my coworkers are extremely supportive and willing to help, it is a very friendly environment."
good,"comcast was a great place to work the managers and my co-workers were all like family. job came with great benefits and was very enjoyable, the hardest part of the job was overcoming objection."
good,"The company is good to work for and pays well, but messes up with customers a lot and we get the worst of it. Also management seems disengaged but tries to do a good job"
good,"This job was very enjoyable at first, but after a while you notice supervisors can definitely do better assisting with tech support agents. Lots of attitude and not enough helping. Techs can be very rude, so that would be the hardest part. Most enjoyable is being around peers."
good,"Benefits are awesome: Insurance, services, 401k and stock purchase plan is great and probably 2nd to none. Competitive pay and positions all over the U.S."
good,"A typical day is taking calls and most times they get to the right dept the first time and you help the customer with whatever dept you are. If you get the wrong dept call, you do a proper transfer of introducing the customer to the next representative. You work different departments at times for the best customer experience You have weekly meetings with supervisors where they listen to your calls and coach you based on them. You have many goals that you must meet each month and year in order to advance in your role. There tends to be a lot of contests and raffles through out the week/months. A times, free food for different occasions and times of meeting different network representatives and possibly getting free items from networks or raffling to get free things. You do get a lot of customers and they all are different. Some are super great while some are just not the nicest of customers. It is a very high paced job especially with all the new technology coming out."
good,"I enjoy going to work everyday at Comcast. The environment is comfortable, the management is friendly, and they do their best to make sure their employees are happy. My only concern is the amount of pay for what their asking of you as an employee. "
good,"the most enjoyable part of my work is making a difference . I like all of my coworkers and the people who work for Comcast. I have learned to hone my skills in  problem solving , sales and customer service."
good,Comcast was a very diverse and overall good company to work for. They recognized and rewarded employees for going above and beyond their job description. I enjoyed the eight week- paid training course along with learning about the ever- evolving technology gadgets.
good,"Excellent work life balance. Flexibility and accrued time off are important when starting a family or have other needs."
good,Prepare team of 12 to 15 technicians for productive day of field work. Address concerns of available equipment or supplies and create plan so customer not affected. Address customer and management concerns as needed. Hardest past getting tied to administrative tasks to support field team. Best part of position fulfilling both customer and team concerns. Problem solving.
good,"Its a pretty good job, as far as co workers they are the best. As far as upper management, not the best. Excellent pay and customers, wonderful services."
good,"An environment that promotes professional growth and development, and if focused on maximizing the customers experience."
good,"Overall on a typical work day I start every morning by signing on and see where my work is for the day. I make sure my tools are in order, I have enough supplies and equipment to do the work that is required each and everyday. I have a back ground in sales, having goal, exceeding them and metrics that I surpass everyday. When I work; I work hard to make sure I do my job correct and to communicate with customers to make sure they understand the problem, what I did to fix the issue and to answer all there questions that they may have."
good,is clean place and fun place I love this place the only ting a don't like is my shift  my co-workers are nice we help each other a lot to make everything easier.
good,Good pay great place to work. The hours suck but bonus checks make up and the extra dollar for night shift. If you have kids make sure you have a legit babysitter because there no understanding of not having one. Some sups are awesome others are horrible.
good,"My typical day at work is one that includes getting to work early so that I can set up and be prepared.  Everyday, the following is what my goal is:  I go into work focused along with a positive, friendly attitude which remains throughout the day. I enjoy working with people, co-workers and taking care of customers in a friendly, efficient manner.  I concentrate on what the customer wants and needs and then I go beyond that with excellent customer service.  I am very organized, a quick learner who is not afraid of change.  Every customer is different and I always treat them in the manner in which I want to be treated.  I adhere to company policies and regulations as they are extremely important to me and the company in which I work for as well as the customer.  I follow through of what is expected of me and more.  I have experience using many computer systems.  Software experience includes Salesforce, Excel, Microsoft and CRM, AS400 systems.  I have been a manager before and I am familiar with their expectations."
good,"Work in a fast-paced call center environment to make outbound retention calls to existing customers who have recently obtained and/or upgraded services on their account. The main responsibility of this retention job is customer service. You might answer questions regarding billing, how a particular product works, what type of support is available, and so on."
good,A typical day as a Comcast Direct Sales Rep would start at the office to turn in previous days work. Resolve any problems. Then it was off to the field to cold call.
good,I am responsible for the daily workings of a Master Headend and 6 Hub sites. A typical day consists of driving to/from these sites to address facility or network infrastructure issues. I am on call for these sites 26 weeks of the year on a 7 day on call. I work within a team of 7 in the state of Vermont.
good,"I would start the day at 9:30 a.m. by opening all of the computer programs I would use throughout the day and counting and filling my cash drawer. The store would open at 10:00 a.m. Most days there were people coming in non-stop to make payments, order services, pick up or return equipment and exchange equipment. I liked seeing all the different people that came in and I liked the fact that I stayed busy most of the time. My co-workers were congenial and helpful, although there wasn't much time for personal talk. Something I learned at Comcast is that they have a LOT of dissatisfied customers! I'd have to say that dealing with those issues was the hardest part of my job. I could understand their aggravation with the billing system and the call for help center. Unfortunately, I was not in any position to FIX these problems. "
good,"If you can get in do it, great benefits management is good, overall great experience.Oh and the perks, you pay only around 35 dollars for all lines of service."
good,A beautiful opportunity to grow and improve one's self. It's a lot at first but after a couple months it becomes a habit for you.
good,Awesome company to grow your craft.  Working as a team plays a major part in the success of the day to day duties.  Working at Comcast has enhanced my electrical craft.
good,"Excellent environment to work, Co- workers are awesome  Good Team always supports in Peak time. Very hard working during production support."
good,"Working at Comcast was  very rewarding in many ways. Learning experience was very significant, Your customer service skills become superior and discipline as well.  If you Worked for Comcast, you are equipped to work almost in any 500 fortune company.  a typical day is to be on the phone for 7 hours straight, talking to customer on the telephone making sure you meet time with the customer, not place them on hold, keeping a conversation with customer throughout the call while you are trouble shooting their issue, being extremely polite,  and exceptional customer service skills. At Comcast customers are #1 priority with or without reason. It is some what  stressful at times  and very demanding, all metrics within the Company have to be met  Not much time to share with co- workers, all have different shifts and always logged to the phones. The hardest part of the job is dealing with abusive customers, not all, are abusive some are very nice.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help customers with their cable needs ,  specially with  the baby boomers that technology may be a challenge too. after all they were not mad at us, they wanted their services working since they do pay a significant amount of money for cable monthly. Management is somewhat  easy going,   all supervisors have a different culture of rating and working with you as a team member. Company's Credo is taken very serious and you Must meet all their goals, at all times , if not there are serious consequences."
good,Great place to learn how to sell and grow a career.   Thankful to have been a part of it for 8 years.    I think they will always be a technology pioneer.
good,Job flexibility to allow for work life balance while meeting job deliverables. Company make every attempt to ready employees for advancement from within the company. Good company benefits and training.
good,"Beautiful facility, Very secure building, Management communicate very well with subdivisions. I learned professionalism as well as commission based sales."
good,"Management could've been more open to communication to make things run smoothly but kind people overall. I enjoyed the small overhead so there was minimal to no gossip or messiness. The hardest part of the job would have to be the wiring for the alarm system, it would go off in the middle of the night and I would have to run to the office to turn it off."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work, they have good benefits and good pay. Everybody is so nice and friendly they are more like family. They do have strict policies that they regularly enforce but nothing too hard to follow. I really loved my job but unfortunaly my circumstances changed and I could no longer work late hours, so I needed to leave which was disappointing."
good,I worked for Comcast which was a third party contract for tlkgroup. This was an amazing job environment. Everyone got along and it was a lot of room to grow along side of team effort.
good,I enjoy my work at Comcast.  The company is always staying ahead of the curve with Technology and innovating new services and products
good,"Comcast was a great place to work at with good management and a motivating team, ultimately helped us meet application deadlines."
good,"Large, well-known company with great benefits and employee perks. Fair schedule options, pretty decent management. Hardest part of the job is the constant complaining of customers, but that's the nature of the position! Most enjoyable part is the warm, diverse environment. Also, great commssion and decent base pay. Common issues are the rapport the company already has with the community (which is not good) and the stigma surrounding the company name."
good,Comcast strives to maintain a small company feel.  This results in very dedicated employees who each carry a significant work load.   The infrastructure is a little top heavy and the challenges tend to derive from inconsistencies in processes and systems; resulting from their many acquisitions/mergers.
good,Comcast tends to take care of their employees compensation wise. But their constantly looking for ways to cut corners to save money. And just like most telecom companies now they move their call centers out of the area. Other then that everything is on the up and up.
good,Through my time at Comcast I noticed that it is very easy to bounce ideas off everyone that I worked with. Nobody would criticize anyone's ideas. It was very easy to get help and it was a fun friendly atmosphere.
good,"this was a fast paced company, high call volume atmosphere, a typical day included taking calls in matters regarding billing disputes and technical support for our 3 products which included Video repair, high speed internet and digital phone support. I've learned that I can do well in this fast paced company handling high volume calls and satisfying our customers with their billing and technical support. Also learned new computer skills to help with technical support using our website to guide our customers to fixing their email issues or other technical support. "
good,"Fast paced environment that is constantly changing.  While that can be challenging, it is also very rewarding.  senior management is constantly looking to grow the company."
good,A typical day of work for me includes answering inbound calls and trying to save customers from canceling their service .
good,"It was a call center, so of course it wasn't great, but there was always a sense that the company knew that, and did their best to make things as easy as possible.  Many co-workers had come from competitor's call centers and said the Comcast one was hugely superior, much more relaxed and fun in general.  I generally liked my job with the only negatives being a very inflexible schedule that interfered hugely with college, as well a trend towards making sales outweigh all other performance metrics, despite our job being tech support, not sales.  Benefits were outstanding, pay was pretty good for a job that didn't require a degree."
good,Comcast gives their employees great pay and benefits. There is also many opportunities to grow within the company because of how many different departments there are. If you have a lot of experience in customer service this job would work for you but you need a thick skin. A lot of the customers you interact with are pleasant but there are also customers you sometimes have that can be very insulting and difficult to please. That is definitely the hardest part of the job. But you will find that in any customer service job. A typical day at work consists of interacting with a lot of people and selling services as well as setting up appointment and taking payments. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy. Being able to sell a product and get the customer excited about it is a definite plus. I've learned a lot of clerical experience at this job as well as how to work with customers to give them the greatest experience they can receive. The people I work with are great people and really know how to do their job well but the management is sometimes a little hard to get a hold of when needed if they are not at the store.
good,The product was Superior and the people who worked there were tops. Going door to door can be difficult especially during the winter months.
good,"Great Place to work! Awesome benefits, working here for almost 6 years. Friendly supervisors along with Human Resource. Fast paste but easy going."
good,"The company culture and people are amazing here.  The only issue encountered is that Comcast stays in a Cable Provider Wage Bracket.  I work and process nothing but telephony/data, and we are still placed into the cable industry despite this niche market share we are fully engaged with.  Therefor the pay reflects as such; and would be the only recommendation to Comcast to change."
good,"Work days are great. Great co-workers. wonderful benefits and great ideas for evolving the industry. "
good,I enjoyed my time working there.  Very autonomous and flexibility on working projects.  received constant appraisal from the manager.
good,"Comcast has world class products and services that far outweigh the competition. I have met outstanding individuals and leaders as this is the most enjoyable part of my job. As a memeber of our sales organization, I've enjoyed working with the residents of our community."
good,"Good company"
good,Overall a very good company to be employed with. The benefits are tremendous and there is a lot of room to grow. The company does a l of of hiring within the company so there is room for advancement.
good,Contacting customers and looking to continue to add consumers. This is a very metric driven job. Numbers mean everything.
good,Great place to work and are very strict on policies and procedures. Positions are usually lateral if you are in customer service.
good,"COMCAST is a great  company to work for however, they seem to micromanage EVERYDAY. I wish that they would allow us to just sell. They do have great benefits though."
good,"Great place to work great people and management."
good,"For the most part, a good company. Typical customer service cons. Dealing with unhappy customers. After tech support customer service, moved into escalations, not good if you can't handle irate customers 24/7."
good,"Management varies, however my immediate supervisor looks out for employees and creates a nice atmosphere for work. The corporate side, on the other hand, does not."
good,"Comcast is a GREAT! company to work for. I really enjoy the environment and the people I've met along the way. Management cares about customer and employees needs. I wish there were more incentives working for the company, its a wonderful start to a great career."
good,"Pros"
good,"Big company.  Offers lots of market options for career.  Lot's of tenure, but this can be a detriment for advancement if you're not in the ""club""."
good,The company is a excellent starting point for someone who is looking to enter into one of the larger communication industries. Great benefits and excellent pay.
good,"While at this job, you will be able to see new places and meet different faces, on a daily bases. This job requires lots delivering. Being able to known your surroundings is really beneficial, to this company. Time management is highly looked at."
good,the environment is relaxing. the relationships you create with co workers can last a life time. This company is one that you can retire from.
good,Great place for work-life balance. Constantly challenged me to explore cutting edge technologies.  Supported my growth through numerous training opportunities and resources.  They care a lot about their employees and are flexible with working from home.
good,"Trust and professional attitude,  and a management that has an open door policy for all the employees..."
good,Comcast is a great place to work if you are a technician in the field even though the call centers have been taking a big hit lately.
good,Comcast is a decent company that allow opportunities for growth. They also provide great benefits. The only downside is their pay scale is not the best.
good,working environment is not bad and every friday we have party in this company but sometimes we have balance some pressurized work from other
good,Great work place where we all work together to get the job done.  Growing company where innovation and technology is just as important as the quality of customer service. Open-door policy is encouraged among all employees. Sense of family among co-workers. Hardest part of the job is the flow of communication slipping through the cracks at times.  The most enjoyable party of the job is how teamwork is a collective effort among all.
good,"Working for Comcast/NBC Universal was a great opportunity. Comcast was a great company to work for that put a lot of focus on the happiness of the employees. "
good,"Era un lugar divertido con mucho relajo todo el tiempo, era simple y facil de lograr pero el salario no me gusto"
good,very flexible and convenient. my coworkers are very nice. i didn't work weekends so that was a plus in my books. we also had nice gatherings and the benefits are great as well.
good,"Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen, I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth, but it's up to you to make it happen."
good,"Comcast is a good company that treats its employees well overall. Products are superior to competition, training is good, good bonus structure. Work facility was outdated and sales pressure a bit high on a daily basis but overall a very good employer."
good,it was a great call center job. had healthy competition and competitive wages. great variety and helpful learning environment. excellent benefits and perks
good,Challenging... make atleast 20 cold calls and close atmost 3 deals daily. My colleagues are very inspiring. The Management team create room for improvement and motivation.
good,"XFINITY is awesome. Great co-workers. Great benefits. They truly care about their employees. I enjoy challenging assignments and XFINITY offered this. Overall, it is a great company."
good,"A typical day at work at Comcast was nothing but fun!  I got paid for a job I loved so much.  My passion has always been driving sales and superior service delivery to our customers. The Management made it so easy for employees to be heard with the open door policy."
good,My Day started at 5:30am till 4:00pm I would first complete a tech stock report and fulfill all techs with the equipment they needed. I would then proceed with reconciles on a monthly basis 4 different supervisors about 15 techs per supervisor which i would create a monthly reconcile calendar for each sup to scan all there techs. I would then do all Locker returns of used equipment from former Comcast customers. I would also handle all of Comcast destruction of Comcast company assets and record all end of life equipment for destruction.
good,"I enjoyed working for Comcast - for the most part, management was supportive and encouraged success. I gained a lot of experience and exposure from my time at Comcast."
good,Very well organized company. I enjoyed my position with the company. They always had some type of training available if you didn't know a particular procedure.
good,"Comcast is known many things, most of them are not good in the public eye. However as a past employee, yes there was stress. Yes at times it seemed as if no one knew what was going on. But in the long run it was a very nice and stable work place with adequate (although expensive) health care."
good,"I honestly really liked working here as a cable tech (cable guy). Once you get through the 6 weeks of class room training and a few weeks of OJT, you're working on your own with your team on support if you run into a problem. The work is very individual driven as you are on your own working out of your company truck. Some days are longer than others and you have the opinion to work OT for time and a half. Your co-works are your greatest strength as they have years of knowledge and will help you out when your in a pickle."
good,"This is a great place to work. If the office didn't move to Pennsylvania, I would still work there. The management was helpful and my coworkers were helpful."
good,"my work experience there for the majority was wonderful, was blessed with several great leaders till the end. Ended up with someone with a napoleon complex. Which in all fairness can happen anywhere."
good,"a small team of individuals working together to assist in the ordering, uploading and maintenance of online advertising. we had the ability to think for ourselves and were encouraged to find new avenues for success, but also had the support we needed in case we found ourselves in a predicament. Fantastic benefits and healthy work place that did more than its fair share to keep morale boosted."
good,"Great benefits, plenty of training, hardest part of the job was the amount of red tape, enjoyed working with people, co-workers are like family"
good,Comcast is one of the best work environments have had the please to work in. My managers are easy to talk to about any personal or work issues and get resolved quickly if there is a resolution. They really show concern about my health and well being. Always willing to work with my schedule if any life crisis happens.
good,"Review of Service order agreements to ensure that their set up correctly"
good,They care for your talent and innovative ideas. Stress free environment. Top management is stagnant. Work-life balance as Full Time Employment.
good,"A typical day would include having a short pre-shift meeting with our supervisor, who would give us words of encouragement and ideas to have while on the phone with the customers. We would be on the phone for more than 3.5 hours, taking upwards of 250 calls a day to customers of all backgrounds nationalities and personalities. I learned to be ready to react on the spot to whatever reaction you will get from a customer and be able to overcome objections placed by them to secure a sale. One of the of the hardest part of the jobs are the ability to push for sales to reach your quota. But the atmosphere was enjoyable due to the constant celebration for every sale and the care that my supervisor and HR representatives put into each one of us and our growth."
good,Door to Door. Tough sell. Minimum 6hrs in assigned turf/territory. Good compensation. Great benifits. Great training pay.
good,"Clam, and cheery, coming into work was always a joy. Lots of standing, but always seeing new faces was awesome. Learned more about Comcast then I thought I would. Job as a whole was just awesome plus free Comcast services...can't beat that"
good,"My experience at very large corporations and smaller companies as well has taught me how to be change-agent and how to get things done."

good,"I started at level entry customer service with trouble shooting cable.  I advanced to Tier III support.  Business, VOIP, Internet, Cable.  I learned great ways to relate to customers over the phone.  I get along with co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to always resolve the issue over the phone.  Sending a tech could take some time.  The best part of my job was I had all the tools to do my job from step 1 to the end of the call.  I enjoyed working from home, and vacation time."

Hardest part of the job was trying to win every contest! Co-workers, on the most part were friendly, like a family."
good,"Answer a multiline telephone helping customers understand their bill. Also help customers with lowering this billing. I am also part of the Floor Lead team which allows me to help other employees with escalated calls, and any questions that they may have pertaining a certain account. I learned many new skills within this job, like how to understand a persons bill, as well as learning how to help a customer decrease the amount they pay a month on their billing. Within Comcast, management and my co-workers are very wonderful. They are all very understanding and they are their to help you as much as they can. The hardest part of the job is answering the calls when customers are upset and angry and like to take the frustration out on you. The most enjoyable part is being on Floor Support."

good,Its ok but definitely needs a lot of improvement in the company
good,"Every day I go into work and answer calls. Typically I would catered to customer needs. Ideally I feel empowered to make my own decision without my leadership assistance. My co-workers are just co-workers, but some are considered good friends. Comcast is a good job that will provide you great benefits and job security, but if your looking to advance and grow, its probably not a place to start."
good,"The company is great and my benefits are awesome. I have learned a lot about marketing, developing sales training, developing sales professionals and video productions. I have also learned a great deal about working collaboratively, which is a skill that can be leveraged anywhere. "

My co- workers are amazing, i spend so much time at work they are like my second family.  management has changed for the better.  we were a brand new store, and we all started together, it has been rough at times, but its gotten much easier to bare.  i'm only speaking on this particular store.  when i visited a different store, they LOVE  their store manager,"
good,Comcast is the best job i've had in my employed career.  Friendly atmosphere and coworkers.
good,"Excellent work environment. But be careful not to end up on the outside of ""inner circle"" or you will be gone."
good,"The training was decent. The customers were challenging but still okay to work with. The pay was pretty decent. They just kept pushing that we needed to sell, sell, sell, and sell some more while we were trying to troubleshoot with the customer. I found that hard to do."

good,"The atmosphere at Comcast is very enjoyable."
good,"Summary says it all, from the sales aspect, "
good,I enjoy working new challenges. Gets along   great with fellow co-workers. Loves the fast pace of the job.
good,its a wonderful company its just no self care for life events
good,"I am overall very satisfied with my current employer. I enjoy the work environmnet and I am also greatful to have lots of incentives, contests and option to receive bonuses upcon sales achievement. The people there, however, specifically the sales people are extremely competetive and they don't always attain to the rules of engagement."
good,"Upon starting you are in the group that does outbound sales, outbound sales start at 8 dollars an hour however with commission, it equals out of at least 10 dollars an hour. The goal is to attain two sales per day. 7 dollars a sale, upsellling current customers with other products and services. Listen for customers needs so that you can sell them them the features advantages and benefits. You are not encouraged to provide customer service because it subtracts from you AHT average handle time."
good,Not Leaving Comcast I just want a 2nd job to love. I love  the balance between work an  life and I know my current employer would work with my schedule to obtain a second  job

good,A very fast pace and energetic company to work for with access to company services at a great discount.
good,Great company to work for if your love is call center work. There are some great people to work and always looking for different ways to better assist company. The benefits are so so  now due to all the medical changes going on.  Overall great company for entry level work.
good,A day at work is like any other job. You go in to get the job done and have some fun learning new things in the process. i learned so much about the company but am not able to give out their personal infor due to other competitive companies. Co-workers made the day go by. They were nice and informative. The hardest part of the job was  learning about the new advertisements through the customers and not management. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have access to different types f bonuses.
good,My job was dealing with customers on a daily basis in their homes. Installing their cable and internet needs and solving their communication issues. The hardest part of the job was working in some inclement weather.
good,"This was for the Inbound Sales Representative.  This job was relocated to Portland.  Working in a call center teaches you many skills that can relate to many jobs.  Even though your job title is sales, you will receive calls about anything and everything.  You learn to handle many different types of issues and still find a way to cross sell or up sell.  You will become close with many of your coworkers because it feels like you are in the trenches with them."
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Comcast, lots of great people, management is ok, only gripe is too many ""bosses"" not enough ""leaders"" who are capable of inspiring the workforce.  Miss the days when work was more of a tangible thing.  At this point in my career I spend a lot of time crunching numbers which gets a little dull after awhile.  Pay and benefits are best in class!"
good,"A great company once you get in, very concious about its employees and awesome benefits. My management team is well qualified and the co-workers are very helpful and team players. It's difficult to advance and the recruting process (both internally and externally) is very slow."
good,Because  of Comcast I was able to go back to school.  The education reimbursement program is wonderful.  The staff helped me figure out what I wanted to do with the opportunity if given to me.  I miss my Comcast family.
good,"Very fast paced environment. Changes made frequently to processes and procedures. Constantly learning new products, processes and procedures."
good,Answering call after call to try to get customers to order all services offered by Comcast. Supervisors were there for giving you help how ever they could. Loved all of my co-workers and looked forward into going to see them each day. Convincing someone into buying something they did not want or need. Speaking to the customer on personal level.
good,A typical day at work involves taking care of urgent matters and also attend to pending issues the previous day. My Co-workers are always available and helpful when needed.This is a great oppprtunity for me to meet new people and also learn new skills.
good,Working at Comcast was a great opportunity for me to pick up and learn a couple of new skills; as well as getting a understanding of what a field tech actually does and go through.
good,"Im gracefull for the experience that Comcast brought to my life. I did learn so much from this experienced , not only as a professional but as a person as well. Had pros and cons like everything in life, for an overall view, it was fun."
good,something new happens every day. great team work environment
good,"A typical day at work for me at Comcast Sportsnet begins with processing employee time off requests. After this was completed, I would process payroll for my department. The next thing I would do would be to process any expenses incurred by my department and create a report for the director showing our department's expenses and how we stand with our departmental budget. By the time I get done with these things, it is time for lunch. After lunch is when the fun starts. Usually, we have a variety of professional athletes on our channel and I get to meet them and make sure they have a pleasant experience while they are at my company. My day to day work varies depending on what we have going on at the station that day. If we are airing a game, it is rather busy and I have to monitor to make sure everything is going smoothly. If not, it is pretty relaxed around the office and I am able to get some filing and other basic things done. My co-workers are amazing and they make coming to work fun, this includes management. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with a variety of issues at the same time. One little mistake can mess up an entire television program. For example, when we have sporting events outside of Chicago which we need to put on the air, I have to arrange for travel for at least 5 people who all leave at different times from different locations. I have to continuously stay in communication with all of them so they know what they are doing and where they are going. I have to let the staff know here what is going on so they know who is ready to go on the air and where"
good,"taking inbound calls assisting customers with account questions billing issues or a new sale, supervisors always ready to assist you."
good,"your relationship with your coworkers is what makes working there fun and enjoyable. Team work within your core group is usually excellent, sometimes not all departments are on the same page which can make it frustrating. If you can work independently and posses common sense you will be very successful here ."
good,This is a fast pace environment where there is never a dull moment.
good,"Everyone is friendly and management knows you on a personal basis. The warm culture, consistent training and innovative products make the stressful demands and compensation seem somewhat worth it."
good,"Contributed in developing an upgraded version of the API and taking care of  the authentication and administrative features for  the xbox  xfinity application"
good,"A great place to work, but hard to advance out of the call center"
good,Monitor my team members calls. Coach my agents to maintain high quality customer interactions.  Establish goals that promote a fun and positive environment that leads to success.
good,Comcast has a great vision and is a very innovative and progressive company to work for.
good,"Normally I come in to the office, get myself situated & check emails for new information because things change almost on a monthly basis. I normally take calls from individuals looking to leverage their relationship with the company for a certain goal as in lower their rate , better service, etc. While in conversation I also try to uncover needs to possibly deepen their relationship with Comcast."
good,Working at Comcast was an enjoyable experience. The staff and managers were experienced and helpful. Hardest part of job was working economically challenged areas.  Enjoyed working with the diversity of Houston population.
good,"My day involves putting out fires for our customers, that includes fixing accounts coding and trouble shooting for video, internet and phone services to get their equipment(s) up and working."
good,"Typical daily duties included accurately keying in orders from Direct Sales Representatives. Verify information, if required, from The Sales Rep, to ensure order details were complete and entered correctly. Enjoyed interacting with my Sales Representatives in the field, built personal relationships, got to know them individually. Fun place to work."
good,Comcast is an awesome company.  It allows you to direct your on direction.  Teaches you how to be extremely organized.
good,"On a typical day, I am usually assisting with training with new hires into the company. I provide them with coaching tips, support for their systems, and also provide them with job aids that I create daily."
good,"Comcast is the leading provider of residential internet, television, phone and home security in the United States. The atmosphere is very chaotic and fast paced. Every week there was a new promotional sales campaign that we, as agents, had to sell to the customer. The job demanded high energy, sound judgment, thick skin and strategy. I learned how to be a top producing salesmen and respected representative of the company. I left this company because I had to return to finish my degree and wanted to seek a career in social media."
good,I had a wonderful experience working with the company and I loved my co workers
good,"Fast-paced dynamic environment.  I learned a lot about the telecommunications industry and how competitive it is. Overall, management is very sharp and innovative.  The company invest a lot in training.  However, my direct manager's style was that of a micro-manager so there was not much opportunity for growth in that environment.  I was surrounded by a workforce that wanted to do the best job possible and had a lot of great ideas, but there was not much attention paid to those ideas because of the department manager.  The hardest part of the job was to deal the controlling attitude of the manager and still satisfy my drive to try new and creative things to achieve success.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people I worked with. They were very positive and we kept each other going."
good,"up dates on products for upgrading customer, what promo are in effect, hardest part keeping up with inbound call quota, enjoyable part being part of a team what worked together."
good,Challenging work day mentally and physically. Great managment very helpful and goal driven.
good,"Working at Comcast you are consistanly busy.. using multiple skills "
good,the hardest part of the job is getting on the 28 foot ladder and climbing the pole. managment is great. must have great customer service with this company
good,"-Everyday we log on a computer and call different customers"
good,"Comcast is a very great company to work for. I just personally did not prefer the door to door aspect of my job. I have been in sales for 12+ years and this type of sales activity was not my cup of tea, per say. But again overall Comcast was not a bad company to work for :D"
good,"Working at Comcast was a good experience for me.  I got to meet a lot of great people.  If I had to say one negative thing about them, I would have to say that the rules of the calls were very strict.  The calls had to flow one way, and if it didn't it was considered a bad call."
good,The benefits are awesome and the company is very strong financially.
good,"Fast paced company, priority on making a great customer experience for subscribers.  I have been afforded the opportunity to sharpen my coaching abilities and skills.  Management is open to suggestions and available / accessable to teams. Hardest part of my job is traveling.  I cover all of DelMarva and several counties on the western shore of Maryland.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I see techs or supervisors on my team succeed at new tasks / processes / goals."
good,Comcast has an amazing work culture that puts you in the driver seat of mastering your craft and being an innovative part of the future. My role as part of leadership was to engage my team and make sure we had fun while meeting our goals.
good,i enjoyed the years i worked at comcast. I learned a lot with the opportunity to excel inside the company.
good,"I love working for Comcast.  Working for the Regulatory Department at Comcast has given me an entirely different perspective on channels in general ( different between the different tiers as well as which ones are considered regulated and unregulated).  Regulatory Fees, Franchise Fees, etc.  The department is overall an awesome group of people to work with.  The only drawback is the commute.  I live an hur away from the Oaks location."
good,"Overall a very good company to work for.  Vey hectic and demanding, but the salary makes up for it."
good,"Typical work day:  8-12 hours"
good,"I learned to adapt to the many changes of Comcast, due to the different changes in the advances of everyday technology. I've assisted many customers with setting up residential accounts, discussed billing and processed billing payments. I assisted customers with connecting equipment over the phone and scheduled appointments for installations. I sold additional products, and also helped resolve customer escalations. The hardest part of my job was not knowing the equipment the customer may have been using but I still did my job to ensure my customer that what ever the issue may have been that I would diligently do what was necessary to ensure excellent customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I did my job to the best of my ability with the tools given from my supervisors and peers."
good,"Good work environment, good employees.  More accountability is needed."
good,"Incentives for performance given on a daily basis. Promised raises and incentives given. Positions very demanding and very little advancement in this state, unless willing to go to the Indianapolis area."
good,I learned a lot about the telecommunications business.  Comcast Internet speeds are definitely the best in the business.
good,"A typical day would be to come in and check my emails to see what had not been addressed the night before, I would check and see what was new on the the comcast site what I could offer the CAE'S to help them make there sales easier. "
good,I worked many hours and volunteered many hours enjoyable office Management was great pay and benefits were great.
good,Competitive industry of constant change.  A very good company with strong leadership to stay competitive in multiple Lines of Business.  Often times your ability to adapt to rapid change will determine your success in the industry and company.  
good,"Very good benefits, low pay, and you need to be a very good problem solver."
good,"Continued changes in technology make this position challenging, both to our subscribers and employees.  Being involved with a leader in technology and communications means this information needs to be explained to our customers.  Often the frustrations of our customers are put at ease with simple explanation during troubleshooting of issues.  I enjoy this aspect very much.  The other challenge most often encountered is the continued changes in policy and procedure, due to advances in the business.  These are overcome with an understanding that this is a fast changing environment.  Trouble shooting basics are the same, new information has to be integrated."
good,I started at AT& T Broadband and was bought out by Comcast which in turn became the biggest telecommunication company in the world*I enjoyed incredible documented success there and was fortunate enough to work in almost all divisions of Comcast*With a n extensive in house educational campus I was fortunate enough to take advantage of many different courses that one could only get by going to college* Unfortunately Comcast moved its business to Portland OR and overseas and I wasn't willing to move from Minnesota
good,When I started at Comcast the focus was solely on the customer. Moral was great I really enjoyed my job. In the last year and a half the focus moved to the bottom line. Customers were not the main focus downsizing was and at the expense of company moral and customer satisfaction. The work itself is awesome and I love doing it but the pressures to meet metrics has turned it and management into a hostile environment. 
good,"I started comcast in 2009 and loved every moment. They closed our call center in 2013 and wasn't able to relocate to another city. Comcast treats and rewards their employees better than any company I have ever worked for. Comcast treats and is an intregal part of the community. If I can find something else, I would def go back to Comcast "
good,"you stayed in the same area, you meet all kins of people,no job is the same.the training that you got in school helped you this alot, but you had to understand the custoners needs and work around the limitation the customer puts you in and still install the equipment."
good,"Una de las partes mas dificiles del trabajo es realizar tareas por las cuales no fuiste contratado, pero esto a la vez es un reto, pues te lleva a descubrir talentos que no creiste tener, las presiones no son de nuestro agrado pero vaya que aprendemos de ellas, pues nos dan madurez y crecemos en cuanto conocimiento pero sobretodo EXPERIENCIA."
good,It is a pleasure working with such a solid team and assisting customers with varies needs throughout the country.
good,"Nice place to work and meet new people, with little supervision and opportunity to keep up on the latest tech and communication devices coming out   "
good,high energetic environment and really help for out customer who invested in our telecommunication product.
good,This is a fun place to work with great incentives but it is a busy work place.
good,"A typical day on the job includes reviewing emails for the latest updates on promotions that are being offered to customers, log in to the phones and start taking calls and dealing with a multitude of different calls and customers. My co-workers really feel like family where I work and they are what makes my day stay on an even keel. The hardest part of my job is that I dont always have access to systems that would be so helpful to me so that I can better help the customers. The best part of my job is knowing that when I get off the phone with the customer that I have made a difference. "
good,"I work in our call center.  Though we handle billing and tech issues, this is a sales environment.  If you get a charge out of selling lines of business and saving customer who want to leave, this is the place for you.  If you refuse to sell, you'll never be successful.  I love my peer group, though other groups are challenged with trust issues.  It's an environment of change.  I find that HR is soft and defensive, which makes performance management an issue.  I look forward to going to work each day."
good,A typical day at work is taking about 50 callls per day from existing customers as well as potential customers and selling/upselling Comcast Products. The most enjoyable part of my job is the commision
good,"Good company, nice to get discounted services - big plus. Opportunity if you like to move."
good,Hardest part about the job is dealing with the stress of working for a major cable sports channel and getting paid as much as I did at my part time job in high-school.
good,Enjoy with my co workers at work and become friends after work
good,Hardest part of job was high volume of calls.
good,"Requires a self-driven attitude. Hours are determined by your production efficiency. I learned a lot about small business owners and the challenges they face and how Comcast can help them solve their needs. The work environment is very welcoming and pleasant. The hardest part of the job is that it's still sales, but the reward comes in the financial aspect and in knowing you helped a small business owner save money."
good,I take calls. I love my co-workers. I love assisting customers.
good,The most enjoyable aspects of the job was the perks that Comcast provided for you. Your day consisted of taking inbound calls relating to billing questions and service issues. They are really committed to having you develop your career if you have the proper support system. The Co-workers are very pleasant and the management as well.
good,• Presenting the value of Comcast Business Solutions to small to medium sized business customers.
good,Every week would be a different objective on things the employees had to accomplish on the calls taken from customers.
good,Good place to work - great benefits
good,"Great Work Place, high chance for advancement, Great Benefits."
good,Comcast was a good place to work but had it challenges ....the manager and the process and prodeural changes were the biggest challenges of all
good,"I worked for Comcast for 5 years. Started right out of high school. Pay was extremly low once I think of it now $10.00 an hour but the health benefits and overtime also free cable makes up for it. In 2 years I was offered a spot on the inbound sales team. Changed my style of life. I went from making 25k a year to 50k a year. KEEP IN MIND I BECAME THE TOP SELLER. This isnt everyones story.I was only 22 lol. The only reason im not there is because that team got closed and we all had to reapply for jobs within the company. One thing you will get use to here is CHANGE... Change in your commision, shift, pricing, even down to where you sit everyday. But would I work here again?!? DEF/ IN A DROP OF A SECOUND! Give comcast a try you never know what might happen!"
good,"Good Managers, Worked on ecommerce and telecommunications project which helped me to improve my skills"
good,Co workers are very friendly and professional... Everyone speaks as we encounter each other throughout the day
good,"This was only my 2nd job in advertising sales. The training was thorough and I enjoy my job. The division I am in has a reputation for limited career advancement, while other divisions sincerely look for internal talent."
good,"A typical work day is very fast paced, and includes speaking with several customers. Management creates a fun and high energy competitive environment, while offering many incentives. The hardest thing to do is to remain positive when speaking with several negative customers, and remain self driven to still get production done. Overall Comcast provides, a fun, family oriented work place, with decent pay and benefits."
good,"Daily work includes advancing various projects to resolve, enhance or create technical service delivery solutions"
good,"I would go to work after school and work at the hospital. My job included talking to doctors and taking their orders over the phone about their patients. This would consist of order lab tests or xrays, diet instructions. I would chart in patient charts their lab results, and temps and Blood pressure taken by nurses. Kept all necessary papers in patient charts. I learned a lot about the medical field and lab results, which levels of certain tests were normal vs abnormal. I also learned to be more compassionate towards people as I was on a medical surgical floor. Management in the hospital was great, and didn't mind answering any questions. The hardest part was trying to decipher the doctors writing to order the right tests for the patients.The most enjoyable work was the knowledge I learned about the medical field while working in the hospital."
good,"A typical work day would consist of speaking with individual customers and resolving thier issues. I have learned how to be more patient when dealing with others. I had an awesome Management team that assisted me with coaching and training to develope the skills to become an exceptional Customer Account Executive. I enjoyed my co-workers, everyone pushed forward to get thier job done and that allowed for a comfortable work environment. The hardest part of the job was having to figure out how to balance any emotional feelings that may tranfer from a customer and learning how to not take those emotions personal.The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity of being able to speak with several different customers and helping to resolve thier issues."
good,A typical day at work involved taking a high amount of inbound calls. Management created demanding sales goals to be met consistently from month to month. Co-workers I have worked with were friendly and personable. The hardest part would be managing 7-10 applications at once but most enjoyable was being able to interact with customers on a professional level.
good,"I loved working at Comcast! I loved the fun we had, and the prizes that were offered and that I won! The benefits were amazing! A typical day at work was just like any other customer service positon, assisting customer with their reason for calling (my FAVORITE part as I LOVE customers...no sarcasm!). I learned great ways to address customer concerns and helpful ways to find what the customer is needing but still being able to meet the needs of the business. Management however, was not a pro. A lot of reps have a hard time with the way management is handled. Supervisors are hardly ever present to assist with rep needs and when a sup call was requested, at times, one would have to wait for clear over an hour on a ""sup line"" when their sup was sitting right there because they refused the call. The other issue is that sups will tell you to do one thing, and two weeks later, write you up for doing exactly as they told you to do in order to secure their own position. Overall, the other co-workers were a pleasure to work with and an overall blessing! Everyone is so helpful and cheerful. On occassion, someone would have a bad day and be a little snippy. The hardest part of the job was hearing a customer voice their concern and knowing that you are limited in what you can do to assist the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I spoke with some amazing customers who helped me to become a better person, in my personal life as well as at my job!"
good,good place to work friendly and educational my experience working at comcast was great the only reason I left was because I moved to a new state
good,"Overall great company to work for. I just wish they truly took the time out to look at your situations, they need a little more work on management."
good,"I Loved my job, A great place to learn & grow. I was giving the proper training to succeed as well."
good,Working at Comcast was an awesome experience. This was my first job out of college. If you like TV this is a great place to work.
good,"A typical day at works involves pulling my incremental tapes in the morning followed by a fresh reboot of the Zenservers to give my users a fresh start to the day. The hardest part of the job is attempting to troubleshoot issues with users still logged into the system or what we call ""ghost logins"". It makes it tought when you've asked everyone to exit the system and some people just refuse to believe the technology has flaws and its made by humans."
good,If you're looking for a place to get started this was a great jumping off point. The company is big with lots of room to grow. I needed to relocate othwise I would have stayed.
good,"I loved working with Comcast, great benefits, free cable, many team building activity. I miss working there"

good,Washington Mutual was a great place to work its unfortunate that they closed.
good,Comcast is a good place to work and takes care of their employees.
good,"Fast Paced Environment. Learned a lot about the business and behind what makes the cable industry strong. Management is professional. The co-workers are great, it is like one big family. The hardest part of the job is trying to resolve the issues in a timely matter. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers resolve their issues."
good,A typical day would start at noon with a visit to the office to process yesterday's paperwork. Then went directly to field and worked until 8:00 PM.
good,Very micro managed but has its ups and downs. Hard to go to any other departments.
good,"Comcast taught me how to adapt to any given situation. Every day a situation would arrise, whether it was comapny driven or customer driven, I always had something to keep me on my toes."
good,Working at Comcast has been a great learning experience. I learned to operate the different computer programs as well as all the behind-the-scenes of cable life. I enjoy my co-wokers as well my Direct Supervisors.
good,"I have been working for Comcast for 4 years now in the role of Billin Specialist/customer acct executive 2 and have helped many customers on the phone with their billing issues as well as sales of products and services.,"
good,"Well anywhere you go they'll be times where you have those up and down moments and days but perseverance conquers all. My experience with the company so far has been all satisfactory. I've learned a whole lot about the cable industry and how thing operate in order to satisfy the consumers. The atmosphere has never been uncomfortable, they have a great open door policy and your opinons or ideas are always heard. Great diverse culture of employees from all parts of the world. A helping hand is always available when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I left the customers home satisifed."
good,"Great place to work ,fast pasced, take care of employees,learning envoriment"
good,Same old routines everyday. Job very easy if you are a people's person! Very chill atmosphere and good management for the most part!
good,Comcast was a fast paced exciting place to work. My days here were very productive. I learned a lot from my managers and had a lot of additional training.
good,Full training available for people who have no prev experience. Having a technical backgroung is a plus when it comes to troubleshooting over the phone. Exelent benefits and assistance to achive company goals.
good,Great commission policy....Rules and values consistently change
good,"Overall Comcast as a company offers great benefit packages for employees that included bundles of some of their services at no cost to permanent employees. Work culture is fun and they always reward and praise their best sales team members. Open door policy. Supervisors and managers are always willing to speak and encourage their employees. They praise their employees with bonuses and other perks that include discounts for products from business partners. I had a great time working for the sales team. Only problem I had was Work-Life balance. In order to complete my weekly hours I had to break down my day into 2 shifts of 4 hours sometimes 3 or 4 times per weeks. Working from 10 AM - 2:30 PM and then from 4:00 PM until 8:00 PM. But despite this fact, management was flexible to accommodate their employees needs in terms of time."
good,"Customer Account Executive provides tech support for over 120 customers per week resolving digital cable, internet, and phone services. I've learned the process of provisioning equipment, entering orders for additional services and how to handle disgruntled subscribers if services are not working."
good,"This is a huge company, some room for advancement depending on what area of the company you are working for. Co-workers and management are nice, respectable people. Competition from similar companies is causing restructuring of the work force, some new jobs created, and many phased out."
good,A typical day at work would be fast paced. You never no what's going to happen nothing is ever the same from day to day.
good,"A typical day was always busy and at times very interesting, I learned many things and found out I could do a lot of things I thought I couldn't . I had a lot of fun with management and my co workers they all became like a family to me and I still stay in touch with some of them on a daily bases.The hardest of my job, part was telling a customer no.The most enjoyable part was being able to help some one with a problem or concern that always made my day."
good,"Working for a cable company had many benefits. For one, we were given free unlimited cable, as well as we would be given bonuses/trips for upselling different products. It was very team oriented, and we were always being trained for new and upcoming products and ways to improve our customer service skills. What I learned most from this job is to always put the customer first, and to always make sure the customer's issue is resolved and the customer experience with us is enjoyable."
good,I worked here for 18 years through three company name changes and progressed from a Customer Service rep to Customer Care Supervisor. I was also given managerial duties in the absence of my direct supervisor.
good,"Your always learning there, multiple areas for learning. Great Coworkers, and a lot of people there with a lot of knowledge you can learn from."
good,"A day a Comcast can be stressful if you don't make the sales you need. I learned that sales is not that hard.Management tries, but I think they forget what its like to be on the phones. Co-workers are great I miss we all help each other get through the day. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate customers, especially if they've been on hold for a while. The most enjoyable part of the day was laughing with my co-workers and supervisor to make the day go by faster."
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work. Working with Comcast for 9 years, I found it to be a relaxing and rewarding job. Never having Customer Service experience it opened an avenue for me to receive such an experience and now I can say ""I did it""."
good,I enjoy feeling like I am an essential part of the company I work for.
good,"Plan my week attack my plan .I,ve learned the how to help people obtain what they want.Management offers much support. Co workers are helpfull.Getting jobs installed can be a challange. Helping people enjoy there entertainment and getting to do so is rewarding."
good,"Training was excellent and fully prepared newcomers for the position. Hours are flexible, shift differential for anyone working after 12 pm. Team based environment, group focused. Hand picked to participate in special projects. Commission and incentives for doing well. Excellent benefits and healthcare compensation. 401k and employee stock purchase program."
good,Comcast Was A Company Filled With Joyful And Amazing People I am Happy to have gotten that experience and be apart of something so big that i watched and helped Grow. A typical day at work was coming in going to the break room grabbing snacks for break or they might have catered lunch or something. I would than make rounds to say hello to everyone. Than it was off to my desk to log in with a ten min prep to check emails to see if any new changes have been updated. the hardest thing was the constant change without proper training so it was confusing at times when accounts would be messed up. the most enjoyable part was we were paid well for our hard work and the people our company consisted of was the best!
good,"Comcast is a fun place to work, training and advancement programs are available."
good,"Good call center to work at. Able to have flexable shifts based on your peformance. Much room for advancement within the company. Good perks like cable service at almost nothing price. Benefits were very good as well. If you like working on a team and being competative, this is the place."
good,"Work outside most of the day, interacting with customers, traveling in company vehicle. Learned how to install TV's stereo equipment, internet service, wireless internet and other wireless components, advanced knowledge of windows amd mac programs telephone service, multiple numbers, alarms business services."
good,"Currently I work in the location in Shreveport. I love Comcast as a company and as a whole, but the management there completely sucks. We have times where information isn't relayed as it should be, we have no equipment in case there is a loss or a break. Its just an all around experience that completely needs to be reworked. Other than that, the most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself. Your co-workers are great. They have excellent benefits and on its just a fun experience."
good,Comcast is a great stable company to work for. The benefits are great. At comcast you will have tons of fun and the management makes your job super exciting.
good,Customer and employee focused. Communications are highlighted. Great Culture.
good,Good company. Great benefits and good people. Free lunches when asked to work thru lunch.
good,"I loved the department I was assigned to and the people I worked with. When I say team work we gave team work. My manager was a hard manager and that was great she was that way, but I feel she had to be that way, but she was not always understanding to family issues due to she had no kids herself."
good,Great company to work at. Relaxed environment. Employees like their CEO and his work and vision so automatically creates a good atmosphere.
good,"It was a good experience.  The pay was more than adequate and there are opportunities for advancement if you choose.  The workload could sometimes be heavy, but manageable."
good,"Pretty nice place to work, you're issued everything you need to succeed. the job is tough but if you can deal with people you'll have it made. Good folks"
good,Great company to work for when you're learning sales. Great door to door experience and live rebuttles at the door. Has a great training program so you will always be ready before you sell for them.
good,"Great place to work, great benefits such as free tv and internet services, fast paced and constantly changing environment would recommend for anyone looking for a good work place."
good,Great place to work with great benefits.  Corporate feel with lots of positions available if you are a sales professional.  Many of the roles are entry level sales.
good,"Typical service industry type of job.  Benefits are industry standards like 401k, Medical, Dental, Vision, with the added benefit of courtesy services (free/discounted cable/internet/phone)"
good,Although Comcast has a lot of negative feedback in the social media world I found it to be a very good company to work for.  Great training and excellent benefits.  There were some issues with cooperation between different groups but the company was aggressively addressing those issues.
good,"This company is a good place to work. I loved my years i had at Comcast. They did close down the department i worked in, if they didnt do that i probably would of been there for a long time. They pay well, and they have really good benefits."
good,Comcast is a good company to work for especially when you know all your information to help customers. Work directly with Comcast and not a partner the benefits are way better.
good,"My daily routine was ensuring all the techs had there daily schedule and ready to roll in the morning..Making sure they had everything they needed for there jobs for the day.."
good,enjoyed the people i worked with. i enjoyed working with the technicians and having the ability to set my work day. Most importantly knowing that the service we provided was of a high quality and our resolutions were normally same day.
good,"Fast paced, highly demanding, multi-facited customer service enviroment. Best suited toward professionals looking to provide the highest level of customer care."
good,"Spent half a lifetime here (25+ years) as a frontline Cable TV tech doing Cable, phone, internet, home security, both business & residential.  Great people, training, culture, etc. The constant changing environment keeps everyone busy.  Lot of benefits including reduced cable phone internet and security services if you live on system.  Expect pay increases to be rare.  Best way to advance is to crossover for other positions within the company"
good,Large company that has great benefits and perks. Environments can be fun but at times it can be busy. Great ability to change based on business need and you're given the tools to succeed and they do a good job to promote from within. At times they can put too much work on you so learn to say no.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work but the customers can be a challenge. They tired to keep environment light and fun, had good incentives. The management was very helpful."
good,"Overall a good company, but looking for a new direction and challenge. Enjoy working as a team. They allow freedom of expression to get job done. Right now, want to explore different employment opportunities."
good,This company has poured more into me than any other company I've work for. They do value their employees and come up with ways to make what the employees believe in implemented.
good,Work from home; very good support and advancement. I am fairly new but enjoy my position. Company recently combined Tier 2 and Tier 1 departments which does include more responsibilities.
good,"Amazing Company. Happy to be working here at the moment."
good,"They make sure to acknowledge the employees who are working hard. They also gave great incentitives for you work, and bonuses. They had great working hour shifts, and made sure that you had a great place to work.,"
good,Comcast offers many opportunities for advancement as long as you are willing to do the work. Engineering is a very challenging role which took me away from my family more then I liked.
good,Each day i had a daily task that involved customer service and some days it was the best and other days it could not get any worse. I just did what i could help each customer with their service
good,"I loved working for this company. We had some amazing products and services available to us as employees completely free. The work environment was always fun and easy going. The call center was always busy and we had sweepstakes all the time that allowed call center employees to get extra perks (i.e.  best parking spots, gift cards, movie passes, gifts.) I wish they could have kept the Morgan Hill call center open."
good,Overall a great company to work for. Lots of opportunities to grow and develop in any department. Salary and compensation package could use some work. Overall not a bad company to work for.
good,Very oriented company which puts the customer first!! I was very enthusiastic about installing and communicating with customers on there video and internet needs!!
good,Great place to work. Must have a certain drive and personal goals. Make sure your sales goals are higher than the given goal for the week to ensure success.
good,"Comcast is a great Company to work for. I cant really say anything too negative about it, but its a pretty good company The pay sucks, but there's room to grow"
good,I would recommend it. Why do I have to enter more than 150 characters if this is a voluntary survey. This needs to chang. Its pointless. And I will reconsider using this service if this is a requirement.
good,"Over all working at comcast was a mixture of feelings, the job itself was easy and i loved it but the management was poor so it left a bad image in my head."
good,Comcast is a great place to work. The culture is a lot like family. The management team is good and strives to make the workplace a more enjoyable environment. They have excellent benefits and perks.
good,"Good place to work.  Overall, each department worked together to get the job completed.  In some cases there was a lack of direct communication with customers to provide necessary feedback to keep the customer informed."
good,"My contract is coming to an end people are nice hours nice. I really don't have a summary. Work fine , hours fine . Cafeteria didn't have coffee this week"
good,"What I love the most about working here is my team, they are like family to me and I am very grateful for that. Its a pretty large company with lots of little segments in between so there's always room for improvement such as management abilities and being able to grow into the career you want at the pace you not only want but truly need and deserve."
good,"My time at Comcast was one of the most beneficial work experiences that I can remember , I was given many opportunities to grow with the company to become a trainer and assist of a workers and growing also"
good,"There was always something to do so in which I liked because it kept me busy, however there were many long nights I had to stay over and away from my family. Overall I enjoyed the job I did there, the workers, and the work environment."
good,Every situation is different and can be handled differently. Some situations you yourself can't fix. At times things can be very time consuming. You have a schedule try to keep up with it. One person can impact everyone in the field.
good,"Working with the teams, that I’ve worked with for the past 6 years, has been a great experience. My position has been eliminated and I must search for a new adventure."
good,"Excellent place to work and Develop skills. Uses latest technology, open software platform and have good Managers. Good in work life balance and provide support for intiatives."
good,Great place to work and earn a living. Great benefits and worked with a great team.  They are laying off my current position without warning so that is why I'm updating my resume.
good,"Responsible for managing call routing in a multi-site environment to ensure efficient workload balance while supporting the organization’s vision, mission, and customer access strategies"
good,"A typical day at work is doing my best to assist my customer and keep up with the matrix that tracks my performance."
good,"Comcast is stressful but a cool place to work. I enjoyed working there, meeting new people. I enjoyed learning new things regularly. I would work there again just in a different role."
good,"It was a awesome place to work, made awesome friends learned lessons. Would always go back to work if given the opportunity. It was fun so working was a breeze"
good,Training is lacking and you will have to pick up the customer service slack for other employees. Good benefits however. Including discounted cable and other packages.
good,they care about there employees but it can be stressful because of the metrics there are certain guidlines you have to follow working there. they do care about you as an indiviual
good,"We were told that with the amount of work we had, our jobs were secure for the year.  This did not play out and most of the group was disbanded and laid off with a new Executive VP."
good,"Gret job training and career advancement. The benefits, employee perks, the culture and diversity of the company  are amazing. The pay is great, it’s just the stress and negativity of customers that takes a toll on you."
good,"Because I currently work in the call center in the Priority division, I arrive at work and log on to my work station and start taking customer phone inquiries.  I learned that if I go to my station and log on in time it is better for my overall adherence which is something I can manage on my own.  All of my peers work individually but are always there if one needs help or assistance with a problem or a question. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the company recognizes employees that have done and exceptional job."
good,Comcast offers good pay and benefits. Also excellent tuition plans for continued education. It can ba a good [place to work but the company puts a lot of pressure on it's sales agents to meet monthly goals resulting in a hostile work environment.
good,Comcast is a place that takes care of their employees. And they have recently improved the morale and the place structure. Most definitely keep the employees happy for the job done.
good,I love the job but at points it can be demanding. They listen to the voice put in the surveys that are taken monthly. They can work a bit on the work/life balance but overall a great place to work.
good,Working in an environment that has an open door environment. That allows you  to add an suggest out of the box ideas. New ideas an styles that open ways to look at things differently.
good,"Sales can be shaky and job security always in back of your mind, but overall good.  Culture hasn't been an issue in this role, everyone usually wants you to succeed."
good,It’s a great place to work if you want quick cash.  If your good at working door to door you can make a lot of money.  Times have changed though and the sale is much harder.  People don’t want to pay car insurance bill for cable anymore.  They have to get with the times or lose customers.
good,Being an Onboarding agent is a fantastic job if you are willing to work and grow in the department. I was unable to grow here because the position was moved to houston.
good,"Good Atmosphere with constant change and new products and training, good benefits and compensation if targets are made. Learn the product and be excited and you will be successful"
good,"great place to work, best benefits and perks.  I have enjoyed my time at comcast.  Advancement was slow which is the only downfall they has in my opinion."
good,"I learned management and running meetings, as well as being a peer coach. We work with 3 very large systems. Includes CSG, Einstein, and My Source. Sales based position in a great environment."
good,"good compensation, only problem is it was a long drive from east Vancouver wa, to west of portland out hwy 25.  If you live near the place it would be great."
good,"NBC Universal/ Comcast Inc. is a media company that is an excellent place to work. They have good benefits, a comfortable work environment and an overall pleasant staff and knowledgeable set of professionals to work with.  Management is also very professional but due to the fact that the company is global and very large, any changes that are to be made in the environment naturally require many approvals. The Incident Management departments job (which I was a part of) is to resolve as quickly as possible any major incidents that arrive.  Due to the nature of problem solving the hardest part of the job is working with multiple teams at the same time to not only identify the cause but create a immediate resolution.  Often times the difficulty was not in identifying the resolution but was in obtaining all required approvals for emergency changes within the environment.  This is due to it's size and the nature of the business."
good,"Great Commission for hard workers. And great benefits for you and your family. Perks are awesome too, and fun environment to be at. The moral is always a plus."
good,"Great people friendly environment, also a competitive environment. Great job opportunity for others. Company also good benefits and it is easy to make a good bonus check working there."

good,"great low pay, great discounts you have room to grow yearly dollar raise free universal studios ticket discount on cable. you will get use to fast love the company the calls just take a toll on you"
good,"A typical day at Comcast was answering phones and selling Comcast products. "
good,"Comcast is a good company to work for:  High level of professionalism, opportunity for career development, and good benefits.  Career advancement can be difficult depending on the department and direct manager."
good,Great place to work with good benefits and time off. Depending on the position the job can be fast paced or more routine. It all depends on what a potential employee is looking for.
good,The training is thorough and there is generally a lot of support from team members. The leadership team is also very willing to come alongside you and help out also.
good,Good Company. its  good company . dont have any issue or concerns. good work and ilfe    balance. As a company has good incentives and good 401k. No issues
good,I loved working there the only thing was their third party when you are sick which was sedge wick you have to jump through so many hoops to get your sick time off and not have it effect your time off so you don't get written up. The company overall is great and the pay is great.
good,"Assignments by supervisors to go into the homes of Customers to install wiring, in order for cable to work properly. Trouble shoot problems. Often had to climb roofs and underground"
good,"A typical day here consisted of answering billing questions and up-selling new products to customers that called to inquire about. For the most part customers are nice and just want questions about their bill answered. Others can be angry, but if you choose not to take their comments personally and interject sympathy and empathy for their situation, you can get through the day just fine."
good,"Huge company with many levels of advancement. Insurance and company offered benefits are very good. As a giant publicly traded corporation, profitability is the motivation behind every decision."
good,"Typical day is fast paced."
good,"Great company to work for.  Nationally recognized and always expanding and hiring!"
good,"I was hired in to Comcast as a repair technician. I was responsible for troubleshooting customer issues with video, internet and phone service. The repair department moved to Michigan. Indiana went to billing only. I was responsible for answering incoming calls from customers regarding billing issues. The Comcast database is very secure and I was responsible for keeping all personal information for customers safe and uncompromised."
good,"I work for Comcast in 2 different states (rehire). They provide onsite cafe where you can have your lunch delivered to your desk. Free services, tuition, and  really fun toys inspired by tv shows and movies. They have excellent benefits and employee stock options. I was in technical support which is great for advancing  computer or satellite career."
good,"Start my day off bright and early and my first appointment is 7;30-10 time frame. It can be a Trouble Call or install. I knock on customer door and they tell me everything that want to be done. I get everything that needs to be done and educate the customer then I'm off to my next appointment. I learned a lot of ways how to run coax cable so the customer will barely see it, I also learned how to troubleshoot many ways if the customer is having problems with any service they have with Comcast. Comcast also taught me how to work with security equipment so i can trouble shoot and install the equipment in the customer home. My supervisor help me along the way when i couldn't understand why certain things need to be done a certain way, My manger also was a big help on understanding the company vision and how i can advance in many ways. My workplace environment is very professional/friendly. The hardest part of the job will be the times you are stuck trying to figure out how you going to get this appointment accomplish especially when its the last appointment and your super tired. The most enjoyable part is at the end pay week, everything you done is all worth it and you can work overtime almost any time of the year."
good,"Great home/life balance. Direct clear communication from managers. PTO, courtesy services, and a clear pipeline for career growth and management. Would love to work here again."
good,When working there it can be fun with the coworkers and all however the more you learn the job the less you get paid for the amount of work needing to be done compared to what you are getting paid
good,"Great place to work for starting technicians "
good,"High paced job, great benefits and bonuses, a lot of overtime before and after work. Rate of pay was average. Health benefits had great coverage but very high monthly employee costs. Lots of programs online for training as well as travel to other areas for training for advancement, technical, billing ,new programs and services"

good,Was a good experience. Good money and benefits. Family owned company. Would be good fun to work in the marketing department. Sales goals are lofty but achievable.

good,it is very rewarding helping customers solve issues and finding the right products that fit their needs. very generous company to work for and made getting sales fun

good,there is absoultely nothing that i didnt like about this job. even until this day im am thinking about the jbo and i would recommend anbsoultey and on middeof there heads
good,"Though Billing wasnt the easiest of jobs and people liked to complain about the bills.  The staff was wonderful, and a great place to work.  Paid training and able to move up quickly."
good,"This is a great company to work for. It is  a great opportunity."
good,"The company means well. But there is a multi department focus rather than a one Comcast focus. Hopefully this changes over time as I do see improvements happening. However the time it takes to make simple changes, are simply too long."
good,"Overall a good place to work.  The compensation and benefit packages are great.    "
good,"I worked the majority of my career for Comcast. I was able to continue my education/training, recieve benefits and comparable pay. It was a good company to work for."

good,Good. Has a good work culture. good team environment. Everyone wants to see everyone be successful. They are honest and forthright. Good Dialogue and communication
good,"Great benefit package, courtesy services, great education Reimbursement program. Virtual schedules can be better with more straight hours instead of splits."

But, if you can make it past it or work elsewhere in the company there is a lot of perks. I get full benefits, 401k with employer matching, and stock benefits.

I still have the opportunity to return as an employee within a year and maintain my 19 years tenure upon my return if I decided to seek further employment with the company.
good,"Working for Comcast was probably one of the best jobs I've ever had. It was definitely fast paced, cutthroat, and stressful (handling appointment management, repair, billing, and escalation calls) -- but the coworkers were the most amazing people I've ever had the pleasure of working with, there are a lot of job advancement opportunities, and the benefits (health/vision/dental/life/disability/etc insurance all for $116 a month, the best TV/internet packages available WITH equipment for about $40-50 a month, and so on) is just too good to pass up. Great place to work if you can handle the stress!"
good,"I am excellent at supporting employees and assisting customers and feel that type of work is my passion. I excel at researching issues to find out what caused the problem and finalizing the solution or how to escalate if necessary. I also managed the uniform budget for 200 plus Door to door sales agents. I would book hotel rooms for our new employees while they were in training. I would process audits for sales integrity. Manage expenses and process invoices. Daily management of internal database processing ticket submissions by employees requesting credit to customers accounts, correcting customers services , rescheduling or submitting installations or trouble calls, assigning specific turf using SFA...able to wear many hats at once!!!"
good,The coworkers were nice to work with as team. Management provided very little time to meet higher unrealistic goals to meet that resulted in mass layoffs
good,A great place to start your career. The benefits and cable discounts are excellent. I really like the atmosphere. Friendly staff and many opportunities for commission.
good,Pretty good while it lasted. Was laid off in December 2017. Always had weekends off. Holidays off. Great pay and benefits. PTO was great 22 days per year. People were great to work with.

good,"Comcast takes care of their employees. The overall compensation package is very generous to include competitive salary, medical, vehicle, tools, clothes, and cable services."
good,A typical day consists for 5-7 jobs depending on how busy we were. Trouble calls ranging from bad equipments to bad cable lines to T.V.'s on the wrong input.
good,Working at comcast was very changeling. We were taking a high call volumes every day with the expectation of solving every problems that the customer had. The company provided us with every tools and information with a high knowledgeable managers to help us and guide us to make sure we gave the customers a 100% satisfaction.
good,I would have rated higher if the threat of a merger happening wasn't the biggest thing on everyone's mind during my tenure with Comcast.  It paralyzed everyone and everything during that time.
good,Learned how to speak with a wide range of customers. Experienced several cultural groups while being employed at Comcast. Very fun and productive place to work
good,Great place to work due to benefits are extremely Competitive. Very high stress job in a fast-paced environment with typical business politics. When Comcast does offer a courtesy services for product knowledge and Education for career advancement. This job is not for the faint of heart.
good,"Great people, positive culture, fabulous benefits and they invest in training.  It’s hard work, processes are not the most streamlined but leadership is mostly transparent so its less frustrating.

good,"If you're okay with working outdoors and in various weather conditions I recommend Comcast as a place of employment. Great benefits, leadership, and decent pay for work."
good,it was my first call center but a lot of other people who worked other places did not care for the managers. If you don't deal with a crowd then you will stay out of the typical call center drama.
good,"Working in a call center is hard work sometimes. You go in, clock in and start taking in bound calls. Never knowing what kind of call you are going to receive! And they are never the same! Could be about billing, a reset on the device, or maybe you have to transfer it over to technical. Could be a new order, or if it's someone wanting to cancel their service, transfer to another department for them to save them from canceling."
good,I truly enjoyed being at the front counter and speaking with all guest that came in. the best part of it all was being able to be myself and excepted.
good,A great place to work if you want a descent and stable job. If you are looking for a place for advancement and growth then it may not be the best place for you as you'll be in your position for a while before being able to move up.
good,"It was a great experience , it helped me with my communication and organization skills. We had three or more meeting a day discussing work productivity and everyone had to participate by saying what they accomplished ."

good,"Working at the Comcast Center was fun and it was great to meet new people and to learn something new about what happened in the building. On the same note, the Comcast Center was always productive as when we did have our times to laugh, we always got back to business when necessary."
good,Comcast is a company that is hated by a lot of customers being there we had the chance to turn around the customers feelings that they are valued and so is their time.  Comcast is working towards making them fit into the customers lives not the other way around
good,"If you're looking for a long, steady place to work, then comcast is good for you. Advancements aren't as quick or as high as I would have liked, but you'll have a steady job."
good,had to drive around different locations and locate houses without gps at the time. you had your own freedom and the hardest part of the job was crawling under houses
good,"Love working here however only a temporary assignment. Friendly and caring people, nice perks if you become an Comcast employee. Building well kept and a café for the convenience of the employees."

good,I have no major complaints about working for Comcast except for the pay is to low for what the job requires. If you are experienced your pay should be more than a person coming in with no experience.
good,"Learned how to lead fro the front and manage several personalities. "
good,Great place if you like a little stress in your life.  Work is at time over welming but over all good.  Many workers stay years. still keep in contact with co workers.
good,"as you might think comcast is the bane of all other companies, they actually treat their employees very well, between the perks, and nice wages its a fantastic place to work if you can handle people that are a little upset from time to time"
good,Overall working at Comcast was fun. Management was supportive and my coworkers were encouraging and helpful. The only thing I didn't like were how some policies were inflexible and you couldn't try to dispute certain things.
good,Typical day is spent attending meetings/conference calls.  Working with many business units that require you to change your focus from one call to the next.
good,"I enjoy being an outside sales rep, when I first started with Comcast we were the only game in town. Then competition came in and it became more difficult to sell. The prospects wanted to see what the other providers offered before the would commit.In many cases they would choose the other company and price was always an issue."
good,As long as you have a plan going in on what u want to do here this will be great stepping stone or a great career pathfinder have.Awsome atmosphere to work in for a self motivated individual
good,"Would be a 5 star place to work if the push to sell was not so stressed. Even when you were helping a senior you would be expected to push a product. "
good,"First of all, thank you for allowing me so many years of service to this company and thank you for all those years of free internet, phone, and TV. I enjoyed working for the company a great deal and the opportunities for advancement."
good,"Comcast was a fast paced, competitive environment in which to work. Overtime was basically mandatory and appreciated but not compensated. Overall a good place to work."
good,when I was working there everything was okay but as with many large corporations they have alot of cuts and moved alot of their jobs out of this country. There are still good opportunities but chances are your gonna have to be doing work as a technician going from home to home working extremely long hours
good,"Comcast is a good place to work if all you wish for in life is FREE cable, internet, phone and alarm system service, a good paycheck, good benefits and vacation time.  "
good,"Comcast provides a lot of opportunities for personal growth and within the business as well.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with a different personality on each call, however it's also the best part of the job because it broadens your mindset of peoples day to day challenges in today's world.  Management is great!  Employee services and discounts are awesome!"
good,Working as an employee at Comcast provided me with great employee skills to help further my experience with other employment opportunities. Comcast showed me as a employee that i can achieve goals and go as far as im willing to go so that i can accomplish more skills that are needed to expand within the Company. I am very honor to have been apart of the Company in the three years of my employment. Great employee benefits / coworkers worked as team to ensure equipment were organized properly placedto there rightful placement. I would recommend others to cosidered employment. Within an Company thats willing to further the employees qualification and skills.No experience were required to be apart of the employer Company which providing employee with great and other opportunities aswel.
good,It was alright good staff. Good people good bosses they do take care of there employees and make sure they’re taken care. I left dI to unfortunate circumstances. But I’d defiantly work there again

good,The company trains you very well and is very Team oriented. They give you skills to be successful. Management is help and motivating. Comcast offers a lot of benefits.

good,"Comcast is a nice place to work! They value their employees, offer sick days as well as paid time off. You also receive generous discounts and company lunches. Highly recommended!"
good,"The company stressed knowledge for the technicians, which was necessary to complete jobs."
good,Dispatching tech to install and setup cable internet for customers. Very fun working environment. I loved this company always offered nice promotions to all employees
good,"10 hours shifts, back to back calls, no shift selection choice. angry customers. The days are very long and stressful. You need a thick skin to work there."
good,"the hardest part about this job would be the confusion with schedule flexibly, the lack of concern for their staff and employees.  The typical work days were hectic due to over/under scheduled staffing."
good,The hardest and easiest part of the job was when people tell you no and still try to convince  them to try the services.I learned  how to deal with different types of people in different  areas and learn what would be the best package deal for them. It took some long hours some days to hit my sales goals bit it was worth it.
good,The people at Comcast are great as well as the benefits. Free cable and internet with great discounts on other services provided by the company. Over the past 2-3 years they have done better with the compensation but stil not up to par with other similar companies in the area. Management is very nice and leadership overall is very helpful
good,you have to deal with customers on a day to day basis which could be good or bad depending on the situation. Answering 2 - 300 calls a day could get tiresome.
good,Worked with alot of great people. Handled over 20 calls a day which ranged from tech support to billing to account management and sales. Alot of incentives for working and commission was pretty fair. But alot of grey areas when it came to the business practices.
good,"For the most part, it was a good place to work.  Met a variety of Managers and co-workers.  Have some fond memories and some not so fond.  Learned a lot from Comcast being it is a communications industry and very high tech.  Comcast always rewarded the employees, and made the working environment fun to compensate for the many stressful calls from angry customers about their cable bill, which was the hardest part of the job dealing with not so nice angry customers who called you every name in the book.  The most enjoyable part was getting to know so many co-workers and maintaining contact after work."
good,Fast paced and fun environment.  Led the cable industry for years and still growing.  The benefits were second to none and the people were great to work with
good,"Overall it was a great place to work, I learned a lot that I can take into other job Opportunities, I was given the chance to advance & be promoted good working programs"
good,"over all it was a very good place to work. how ever it was becoming more of a Nation 1 size fits all Company. rather than , focusing on individual markets and its Competition in those Markets."
good,"I was hire as a contractor for Comcast, so my typical day started at a warehouse to pickup my route and equipment. What I learned from my time at Comcast is customer interaction and education is very important. So it was important to be respectful and professional in every possible way. The hardest part of the job? I will say new installation on houses and apartment buildings that never had cable. You would have schedule another appointment to do a different type of installation. That was a bulk installation that needed more than installation. The most enjoyable part of the job? I will say the different customer and places I went to do my jobs, they were very entertaining."
good,"Had a blast being a cable technician, having the freedom to figure out how to solve any cable related issues. While you out on the job it was your job to get there in the driving window and fix any problems with the given time frame."
good,Immediately start the day taking calls. Everything is monitored from key strokes to what is on your screen. Nobody ever calls to say thank you. Dont go past your break times.
good,I worked for Kelly Services and I supported Comcast as it was their client. I learned alot about Comcast and the culture of talent they like me to scout for. It was a great client and experience.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the chemistry with my former co workers. "
good,All in all it was a very nice place to work. Benefits were nice. The hardest part was working during the heat. The job itself is very easy to grasp and get a handle on.

With the ability to use problem solving skills, critical thinking, and an ever changing environment the job does not get boring. The calls are not the same even though you know the customer is calling in because they are having issues with their product, Comcast gave the freedom to troubleshoot and use personal judgment rather than following a script."
good,"Comcast is a fast- pace company that has a lot of room for growth. I have learned the cable business. the most enjoyable part of the job was the perks.The workplace was multicultural, We serviced various people in various communities."
good,"Working with Comcast I've met many memorable faces, and experiences that continue to shape me. I still speak with managers and they recall me fondly. I have no issue with telesales personally, but my potential was not at all useful in that role. I obliterated the sales goals and led my team proudly. Even innovating the actual structure of business in that company. I would much prefer a role that matches my contributions."

good,"Great for anyone that enjoys working in a fast paced sales  environment. The monthly goals are easily attainable. The company is focusing on customer satisfaction, this is a huge plus for me. I have morals and take pride in doing the right thing. The store locations have recently been remodeled. We now sell cell phones. Comcast has a lot of room for improvement."
good,Great place to work build rapport with great people and a location where competition is key.   Comcast is a awesome work place with great benefits.   Job advancement a little slow but if you work hard you can move up.
good,My typical day revolved around scouring information to find local businesses that advertise with mediums other than our video advertising solutions.  From there I would call on those clients looking for opportunities to present our solutions to the potential client.  I reach out to as many clients as a day as it takes for me to be successful.
good,"Pays good once you get into the Bay Area (not so good in Sacramento), maybe not the best job out there (pole climbing, working in the rain, lots of driving), but compensation package more than makes up for it."

good,"when I joined the company as a senior analyst role, I surprisingly found that most people had at least 4-5 years of work experience. Usually people rise to senior role after 2 years of experience. Most of the employees were employed through staffing agency."
good,"Working in the call center I was responsible for promoting, recommending and selling Comcast products and services. I interacted with customers via telephone and email, by assisting in a variety of customer needs, inquiries and issues. By providing resolutions, building a rapport, supporting, reassuring and educating the customer throughout the call, ultimately resulting in providing the customer with a quality experience"
good,Comcast has had many evolutions in the past few years. When I worked there it was great place. Management was fair and employees were friendly. The call center was competitive but that only made us work harder.
good,Pretty good company to work for. Management sometimes sucked but they were tolerable for the most part. They have great benefits and there is room for career advancement.
good,It really was productive and fun to work for Comcast. I did tech support for phone and internet customers. They really did have a ping pong table that we would play in our off times. Lol
good,"You do not have to sit back and take criticism that you feel is undeserved. But you should offer dissenting opinions in a calm, adult manner, focusing on facts and observations. Angry, emotional reactions will only reinforce your boss’s negative view."
good,The job requires you to really get friendly with management. Anybody who tries to think outside the box and come up with new processes is quickly seen as somebody who is trying to undermine the company.
good,"High tech, fast moving, competitive with a very involved team environment. Loads of training arranging from customer service to high tech test equipment. Great Place"
good,"Productive job relaxed environment the job has you thinking on your feet but nothing to stressful."

good,"Tough market to go door to door in, however it is possible to make good money doing this.  They're benefits and company culture were unmatched.  I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a high paying very flexible job to apply"
good,Comcast sales position is competitive. But hard work and diligence have to be in place for success to happen. Bonuses are in reach in this position as well as discipline.
good,"Unfortunately I worked at Comcast for only a year and a half.  During that year I learned about the different advertising products sold by the company.  There were daily deadlines.  The managers were very helpful and encouraged a wonderful workplace culture.  I was part of the support staff and experienced a true team effort from my colleagues.  The hardest part of the job was learning the many (ever-changing) systems, products and procedures required to meet the daily deadlines, The salary should have been higher for the work expected.  Overall, it's a great, diverse company with fantastic benefits!"
good,great company to work for great bonus structure as long as you are pleasent to your caller and try to get an upsale every call and do your best on every call. great company
good,Hard work will get rewarded. The call center has different queues in different locations..   Nashville is turning more towards sales then billing or repair queues.
good,"Working at Comcast as an installer was great at times and stressful at times. It taught me a great deal about dealing in customer service and gave me handy skills with tools. Management was good, I had more good times than bad on the job. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the metrics and the most enjoyable part is the comradery of the company as a whole. Comcast is truly a family."
good,"It's a good experience working with a company treat you as family and you will have so much fun , they help you from below zero to become professional"
good,"Comcast is a very good place to work but it has a lack of opportunities for career advancement. My supervisor and I have been through a lot together. She is very personable and understanding. If Comcast had career advancement, it would be the perfect fit."

good,"assigned a portfolio of multiple dwelling units.  responsible for education, awareness, penetration and market share.  scheduled and held sales events and also handled customer service issues at property"
good,"Working at Comcast taught me to be a self motivated person and to better work through stress. Working in the retention department was a very intense department with the customer base we encountered were typically unhappy with services or the company, causing them to want to downgrade or disconnect services. It taught me to be a more optimistic person, and look at the bright side of things, being my job was to turn an unhappy customer into a happy one. The call center culture was very adaptable, I've enjoyed the family culture of a call center. We had teams and had events and different games and competitions to keep the environment as stress free as possible and keep us motivated."
good,I worked at Comcast for 7 1/2 years I had a great experience I would like  to watch this company  continued  growth over the next 10 years  I believe they will be the industry leader
good,"I took inbound calls from customers who were very irrate. The calls were continuous. It was a very stressful environment because we had to deal with irrate customers and try to sell them more products. Our manager was very kind and understanding. The workplace was very stressful, but my coworkers were very kind. The hardest part about my job was upselling to customers who were calling to complain about the amount of their bills. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers."
good,Overall my experience at Comcast has been positive. I believe i want to do more and grow within the company but if i cannot then I want to try something different.
good,"A typical day would be sitting at my desk waiting for a call to come on my line. I learned how to stay humble on a call with an angry consumer either about their bill or service, mostly the billing charges. Depending on the manager life would be smooth or walking on eggshells. It doesn't make anything better that you are getting verbally abused by the customer on phone calls. The hardest part of the job would be using the software program that sets the services up. The enjoyable part of the job would be the incentives and positive coworkers that will always help when needing assistance. Teamwork!"
good,"Great company to work for. Friendly work environment. Pace was fast but durable. Pay was great, shift was great. I just couldn't travel so far for the office i was located at."
good,Measured approach to the established business as well as new business initiatives.  Tight management linkage to the field.  Tight management of the operation and operational improvement efforts in recent years will take the customer experience improvement efforts a long way.
good,"Use of Excel to input data from customer's account, resolve technical issues, find correct equipment codes and contact customer with resolution, work in fast paced environment at a desk"

good,You learn a lot hear at this company and good co-workers.  Management is fair.  You learn various systems and programming languages.  You need to juggle multiple projects at a time.
good,"Comcast provides fast-paced days with lots of learning experiences. Highlights include Employee Resource Groups and volunteer opportunities. Management training reduces the likelihood of having a manager who doesn't know how to lead people. Excellent benefits and perks, and quarterly bonuses are nice to look forward to. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Part time job, you can work as you are enrolled into semester classes with 20 hours a week and 40 hours a week during non-semester hours. Pay is also good."
good,You are trained to take a high volume amount of calls. When issues arise that are beyond your capability to address or trouble shoot redirection of an irate customer could be challenging.
good,XFINITY Mobile is a high energy and exciting team to be part of.  Each day you come to the office you feel like you are part of something bigger and better than what Comcast is most known for.  It is exciting to see so many smart people engaged and determined to create something our customers will love.
good,"Comcast really is a great company to work for. They have awesome benefits and great coworkers. The only reason I'm having to leave is due to the stress of the ladders. I passed training but in the field I'm realizing its much too stressful to a point where I nearly fell during a panic attack. If you have no problem with working on ladders and like to work with people, then this is the job for you. If you hate ladders or people then I would recommend trying to find something else."
good,"They have too many control issues, but you can make a lot of money there. I find the Outbound restrictions with regard to your hours too controlling. You do make a lot of cold calls and you have to deal with many things that are beyond your control!"
good,With the pay and benefits; it balances out the stress and drama. Great work activities relaxation and exercise rooms. Downside constant changes to system and policies. Difficult schedules.

good,"Overall good place to work...management and co-workers! Very fast paced work environment, but very rewarding at the end."
good,"Technical environment where everyone helps one another. If you like helping people, talking on the phone and learning new and exciting concepts in the cable industry then this is the job for you. Benefits are great. Hours can be difficult at times depending on your preferred shift."
good,good place to work and decent benefits. paid vacations. Not a union job.If you are a field tech you are allowed to take your company. you were allowed to take your car home but not sure if that has changed.
good,"Great company with great benefits.  Some departments seem to be micromanaged more than others.  I have found encouragement to move up in the company, but then run into problems with favoritism."
good,The benefits were the most attractive part of the job at Comcast . the fact that you received stock in the company. I would work there again fro that alone . Management changed often which in my opinion was a good thing.
good,"I came from a grocery background to construction so this was a big change for me but I feel it was a good experience. Manager are great, easy to talk to, loved the flexible hours and daily tasks are reasonable. There are days which are busier then others but that's just the way the work flows. Our business partners vary but most are easy to work with and are willing to help answer and solve problems."
good,"The overall environment was positive and felt like a family environment. There was a cafeteria that was open from 10am-6pm which provided multiple options, as well as a salad bar."
good,"This is a good company to work for, just need a few adjustments. The benefits are good and for the most part, the people you work with are balanced. I would Recommend Comcast as an employer."
good,I worked for a high level executive so there was always something going on.  She attended many meetings so calendar management was important.  I was a temp there and would have liked to stay but there weren't any openings at the time.
good,Very fast pace with great customer interaction. Everyday there is a learning experience. Management is decent.Very multi-cultural and diverse. Hardest tasks can easily be overcome with help
good,Comcast is a good company to work for. They have competitive benefits and pay. I am challenge to make good decisions every day to make our customers experience the best it can be.
good,Started out great then changed comp plan.  Not alot of room for growth of hiring within the company.  Negative changes that made it very difficult to achieve desired goals.  All changes brought moral down
good,"Worked 5-6 days a week taking in bound calls"
good,"Start at 730, log in to your app, conference call with your team, find your first job, call them to let then know you are on your way.  Figure out what their problem is, find the fix, call the next one.  Hopefully you get to lunch before 1."
good,"Good place to work. Opportunities for advancement, depending on how you take it. Management was fair and understanding. Most days there is unlimited overtime. I would refer someone who doesn't have children for this positions just because shifts change frequently. I wouldn't mind working for them again."
good,Great Training and pay with great benefits.  The management I had was not ideal there were a few good managers and the ops teams rocked they are all still there and super nice people to work with.
good,"Stressful, very. Customers are rude. You need to be patient, empathetic, and thick-skinned. If you can get sales, you can make tons of money as a consultant. You can make as much as you try for. Minimum $100 on a bad month, easily $1000 and up, no limit. You're expected to reach sales goals monthly. Lots of vacation and flex time and benefits starting at 90 days. Over 100 hours off in a year. A great job for someone who is a die-hard sales professional.

good,"Although I am no longer employed at Comcast, I am still friends with all the people that I worked with. The job can be frustrating especially when dealing with customers who are disgruntled.

Unfortunately these conditions made it hard to meet quota and even when we wrote the sales to meet quota, it was difficult to have the sales installed on time to each pay period due to factors out of our control. Upper management did not seem to take that into account. The customer service department also got in the way of our job by trying to steal sales from us direct sales representatives and people's poor experience with customer service with old accounts made them very reluctant to sign back up."

They provide a way for all employees to move up with the company and get paid more and you don't have to work there for long to get those opportunity, as long as you work hard you get paid more. If you work in collections like I did. You will be doing inbound and outbound calls to help customer pay or make payment arrangements to keep service on. Its really easy job if you can handle upset customers on a daily basis. but Comcast also offers sales and other job position where you don't have to deal with collection customers.

The hardest part of the job is that your commission is based off how many sales you have completed for the day divided by how many calls you take in a day. The only reason why it's challenging is because you can't really control who calls your line.

I love the wealth of knowledge I gained and the many people I helped and interacted with on a work and personal level."
good,"I was terminated due to being very ill for years utilizing fmla because doctors could not figure out what was wrong with me.  I was finally diagnosed with RA and fibromyalgia which I subsequently was treated for and it was going into remission when I returned to work.  I had to go out on disability due to breaking my foot and returned after 9 months and didn't know the programs implemented for my job and was denied training.  With all prior points against me leading to a final warning and not taking any time off for two months, I was terminated due to clocking out and leaving (in error due to shift change) six minutes early.  They had no other choice, but it does not make up for the fact that the evening manager whom I worked under when I returned to work, did not think I was fit for the job. It had a lot to do with my age in my opinion.  They expected me to stay out of work for good, but that is not what I wish to do.  I need to work, I have tons of bills and disability doesn't pay enough.  Plus, it was broken foot not broken ""brain""."

This is what made the job fun, but also difficult at times.

good,"Overall a good place to work for what I was doing, I was a Comm. Tech. Your compensation changes yearly, in the couple of years I worked there I went from making $12 hr to $17 hr. They have a great benefits package. A few people didnt like their jobs, but they didnt leave, they had good job security for Comm Techs, you really had to mess things up if you got let go. The management was good too, they were open to your ideas....didnt always mean they went through on them, but at least they seemed to really listen and care. The work life was tricky, sometimes you have to work late....emphasis on have to."

good,I feel that Comcast was a great employer and I am happy I had a chance to be apart of this company.
good,"I have had the opportunity to work with several people in all levels of management. My co-workers, as well as supervisors and managers, lean on me to provide everyday assistance with trainings, call quality, and cable trouble shooting."
good,"Comcast is the most relaxed and laid back company I've ever worked for! A typical day can be somewhat stressful due to the fact that 80% of the customer's we speak to are upset about their bills or the poor service they receive from Comcast. Although I work in Billing & Repair the company has become pretty strict on ""selling"" and upgrading customer's service which is kind of hard when the company delivers poor service. How can you expect us to up sell when most of the customers are calling in with a complaint??"
good,Great company going through hugge transition in effort to become more efficient. What's efficient is not always the best choice. There are other elements to consider and I feel that they are being omited at this juncture.

good,"Typical day I routed technicians to jobs that were placed in our work pool dynamically. I used my skill set I had learned working as a tech for 2 year prior to becoming a dispatcher to assist technicians in the field with issues I had encounter. I also assisted my co-dispatchers as needed with special projects, filling in for breaks, lunches and sick days."

My co-workers are what makes a job easy going and an environment that i can thrive in. The hardest part of my job would be when isssues arrive with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I can go to management about issus that I am facing and they are willing to help.

good,Working at comcast as an dispatcher was fun. I had whole different out look on customer service and how the technicians really work. They actually have to do everything manually and then input different codes in the computer system to make sure the cable was working and if not then they would just troubleshoot it. Good job
good,The typical day at work is productively consistent and there are different units of products to observe and learn about and I can say that management is concerned and are careful for the employees I make my day as easy as possible and sometimes that can be the hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing if you need any help or assistance there is always someone there to help you.
good,"Typically a work day would involve never knowing what to expect, you were primarialy on the phones collecting on delinquent accounts so there was no way of knowing what to expect, it could be a great day or a bad one. I loved the culture their though, everyone seemed to look out for one another. That's what I miss."

good,"Fast paced job with monthly quotas to be met. Great traveling opportunities. Learned every aspect of the cable industry. Such as, customer service, plant maintenance, scheduling, management, computer skills, data processing, teamwork, safety, sales and technical skills. Management was decent. Some managers were better at informing then others, but most of them were good at there job. Had the best co-workers. All of them knowledgeable of there position and willing to lend a hand with special projects. The most difficult part of the job was meeting quotas. I was responsible for keeping 28 towns, MA and NH, in compliance with FCC guidelines and regulations. This certainly kept me busy. Working in a fast paced communications company was enjoyable. Everyday brought forward a new task or project. It was very unpredictable and I found that enjoyable."
good,"Everyday was filled with fixing customer problems, and selling new products."

A typical work day included helping customers with billing questions, Connecting service via computer and answering call within my que. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers but I had great pleasure in making them happy again"
good,"A typical day was simple. You would come in, on time, and take phone calls for customers who need assistance and in the process sell or upgrade their subscriptions. I learned a lot from working with them such as experience on what drove business growth (ie: take the time to know what my customer wants) and how to capitalize on that new revenue potential. I also refined my skills of building rapport with customers to build long lasting relationships with them. The Management team was great and so were all my co-workers. I still talk with many of them to this very day. The hardest part of the job was the way the marketing team would sell our products. It would not drive in enough calls in to produce sales in weak months even when great promotions were available. I would have them do more marketing on TV but I was never in marketing. The best parts of the job were the contests and my co-workers. It was always fun to be a little competitive with everyone in the sales department and challenge ourselves. It was a nice dynamic to sales and kept things light even when things were tough."
good,a typical day at work: Sales oriented Division
good,Meeting with the management in the morning.
good,"Comcast is a very good place to work, but as far as self promotion there is very little opportunity to advance once you've reached to the top of your skill-set, you are not regularly acknowledged for going above and beyond the call for customer satisfaction. the process becomes very difficult to move throughout the company and advance yourself. you feel sometimes unappreciated"
good,the managers were easy to work with and actually made work a nice place to be
good,"Always changing, very challenging environment, not competitive with the market."
good,"Considering the size of Comcast, it has really become agile and truly leading the industry."
good,Heavy work load in the morning. Light load in the afternoon.
good,"Typical day you come into work and sign on to the system open up all applications and job emails. Then you check the company e-mails and follow up on work tickets if needed. then you start answering calls and you do that untill the first break which is 15 min, lunch is 30 mintues(1hour in training) then another 15 min break hour and a half before the shif ends. i learned how to trouble shoot over the phone and how to calm angry cust down over the phone. the best part of the job is when you turn angry person into a happy customer and when management at the end of every week give you praise on a call they heard you did great on."
good,"I really enjoyed my time a Comcast. As much as cable guys get flak for dumb, for a good tech the job is not easy and demands that you constantly put your best forward. Though I was fired for something that was not my fault, I do not blame the company; they did what they thought was right. Comcast is an admirable corporation."
good,"Comcast gets thousands of calls per day from 5 or 6 states. They change rules, methodolgy, computer systems, employee evaluation criteria and compensation at least every year. You must learn to roll with the punches! While raises and advancement are possible, getting time off is very difficult and your shift changes every 6 months making it difficult to plan you life"
good,My job required me to answer the phones assisting customers in billing and service equipment issues. I learned a great deal of customer service skills more specifically making a frustrated customer whole through our retention processes. I enjoyed all of my co-workers. Everyone had a great attitude.
good,"Typical Day was crazy busy which is good for getting the day over with fast. I learned a ton from my direct Managers and would like to thank them. On the far extreme other side, the upper management were a little out of the loop, they loved to bark orders but not once did they come to the trenches and see how the front line worked and co exist with their policies they put into place. The Call Center was great place to work as long as the upper management didn't change policies and procedures."
good,"Hours 5am - 6pm with coaching and all. management was great. Co-workers were all great. hardest part of day was the end with practice . Most enjoyabel part of day , was the end with practice and all."

good,"Although every 6 or 7 years I was laid off, I went back and was laid off 2 more times."
good,"Comcast is one company that truly gives you the opportunity to grow. I felt that everybody were all on the same page. This is a company who believes in the idea of hiring from within. I started off as a customer service representative, and through the information I was able to learn from them, I was able to move up to help desk."

good,"Great benefits and perks.   Free and highly discounted services, health benefits were wonderful. Decent room for advancement and a nice culture. Some work life balance issues at times."
good,Is a very good company to work for great benefits and able to move up in the company if willing to. Good teams working together to get the job done quick reply on if have a problem with tools or a job.
good,Benefits are good but job security is always an issue. Raises are only 3% of current hourly wage.   Loved my job of 18 years but due to reorganization my job was noved to Pittsburgh.

good,"Comcast is a great place to work for over 21 years. I've grown and expanded my knowledge as a employee and as a person from installation, service, plant maintenance also maintenance supervisor."
good,I had a great run with Comcast and was able to be part of a revolutionary department designed to focus on the most concentrated area within the U.S. of bulk communities; I already had 9 years of working in the bulk area including Los Angeles. This experience helped make the Commercial Development Department a success.
good,"Hard to get in, hard to leave. It’s a great company to work for. They treat their employees pretty fairly. They encourage and listen to employee feedback."
good,They have great benefits and free service if you live in the service area. If not you lose the service benefit. You must be able to handle very unhappy customers and remain calm and friendly. If you can’t handle extreme stress or have a reactive personality this is not the job for you.
good,"leadership and coworkers are extremely supportive and the tools they provide make things much easier than they could be but company procedures often make work harder (i.e not being given enough time for certain tasks, some quality metrics ) which in turn effect your overall numbers"
good,"Great place to work for. Team, work/life balance, and comp. were great. However, sales tactics would sometimes get a little out of hand, making shady businesses with customers."
good,"A challenging position that will help you develop good skills in a wide range of areas (Communication, good driving, utilizing technology and time management). If you are a lazy person you will be exposed eventually. The company really cares about it's employees overall and the communities. Raises every year (based on personal performance) and bonuses for a high level of productivity and customer satisfation. Good promotion opportunities. I had to leave after almost 5 years because my wife had twins, but they gave me 3 weeks full pay while on family leave. Not a bad company to work for at all overall as long as you are doing what you're supposed to do."
good,"Comcast takes care iits employees.excellent training program to get the employee ready for next product , comscast will offer the customer.i will be glad to refer someone to work for Comcast."
good,"Typical day at work: 12-15 hrs work day"
good,"typical day for me is doing home security installs (2-3 a day)."
good,"It is a great company to work for.  IF you are a go getter and fast paced orientated then this is the job for you.  Great perks and benefits.  It is an 8-10 hour shift fairing start times, days and weekends.  It is inbound call center dealing with customer billing and tech support concerns and needs."
good,i enjoy Comcast you do have to work very hard and have to be passionate about the job and the people who have Comcast but everyone does say that it is easy that a money can do it and the customers some times treat you as such
good,"Comcast Spotlight was a pure joy to work for. I was offered an opportunity in management that I could not pass up. As in any sales, it could be challenging, but the support and the moral of the office environment was electric."
good,"This job is not for everyone, it is extremely difficult to deal with difficult people all day every day for a living.. with that being said the management staff is fantastic, the morale is very high for the position type, the support staff is amazing, and they have an insanely good bonus system and constant in-office drawings, prizes, pools, and awards."
good,"I loved working for comcast back when I was a direct sales representative. The only reason why I left was because I had 0 sales experience at the time and I needed to hone those skills before I could be successful."
good,"I enjoyed working for comcast, i got more experience  and is an opportunity that not every company will give it to me ."
good,"Comcast is the perfect place to start a career. If I had my way, I’d still work for Comcast. Comcast provides discounted service for employees, great health care benefits and the pay is extremely fair. During my time at Comcast the culture was very relaxed and fun. Towards the end however things were not as great due to different acquisitions that did not pan for the company and hard changes were made. But even during that time, supervisors did their very best to keep the culture of the company the same as much as they could."
good,"Comcast provides product 2nd to none.  Career growth, if interested, and positive feedback.  The opportunities are unlimited from Harvard classed to future leaders program.  The benefits and pay rate are comparable to other companies in the same industry."
good,"Answer calls from customers who are having trouble with their services. Express kindness and appreciation to customers to provide an excellent customer service experience and cultivate customer loyalty.  Troubleshoot services to resolve service outages and dispatch technicians as necessary. Find workable solutions to customers issues within policies outlined by Comcast. "
good,"I loved working at Comcast, unfortunately my position was moved to New Hampshire and because of my daughter I am not able to move. The people I worked with at Comcast were my family and I loved what I did...I am going to miss it."
good,Very good with helping understand customers need. Helping customers determine their bill or sending techs to hook up new services made the job amazing.
good,"While stressful at times, working at Comcast was a pleasure for the most part. You are compensated well in Business Services, promotions are laddered. They give bonuses often if the company is doing well. Call volume is exactly what you would expect working for Comcast: high, Management figures were a pleasure to work with. Corporate rules are somewhat rigid and it is expected that you follow the employee handbook."
good,If you like working with your hands and working outside this is the place to work. On the daily you work by yourself and collaborate with other technicians. I liked having the option of working 4 ten hour shifts or 8 hour 5 five day work week.
good,"A day in the life of a Headend tech at Comcast is one of never ending variety. One of the attractions of the job is, while it has it's routine duties, there is ALWAYS the unexpected. As the product of the Headend, TV, internet service, telephone service, is visible to all 200,000 customers (and management) any deviation is almost instantly noted. Time to diagnose, time to repair, is a constant driver of behavior. It is an amazing job for those who can deal with ones work being on public display. One is constantly learning new equipment and new skills."
good,"Comcast provides some of the best benefits a company can offer. They also offer discounts on there services for employees, which is very nice. They also offer stock options. Great place to work"
good,Working for Comcast has taught me a lot about teamwork and that managers can relate to you. You have a hour lunch. You are given enough time to get to your next jobs.
good,"I loved the competitiveness usually sold 1-3 customers a day"
good,its a good place to work but like all area it has its ups and downs a lot of competitiveness and can cause a lot of stress do to their checks and balance system
good,"Overall, great benefits offered (salary, bonus, RSUs, ESPP, SOP, 401k match, insurance, healthcare benefits, discounted cable & internet) to compete with the tech firms. But it feels like two combating cultures of old vs. new: old processes, bureaucracy, hierarchy, tenured employees from the cable world vs. new talent focused on customer experience, simplification, digitization, etc. In some ways it's changing rapidly, in others it's still stuck in the past."
good,Great benefits and discount on products and services. Management has been focusing more on both their customers and employees. Comcast promotes diversity and flexibility that helps with work life balance. The company offers room for professional growth and advancement
good,Comcast is a great place to work with awesome benefits. Your are able to network and build relationships and the opportunity to advance is present. They provide a lot of opportunities.
good,I love my customers and the ability to help them and make friendships. The simple joys of hearing them laugh or cry because you made their day it's a true joy
good,This company offers full time benefits for part time positions. Down fall is if you are not doing your best in your title if written up you are stuck in the role until you do better and if you do not do better you will be terminated.
good,"this was my first actual job where I was paid what I was worth as well as got the benefits I deserved.. I unfortunately was under new management and was made an example of, but if that wasn't the case id still be there the environment and the people I worked with were amazing if I were to ask any one else for help they would and they were more than willing to teach you the game.. I also enjoyed helping people over the phone they trained us very well and it was just maily all about hitting your numbers..."
good,This company truly bends over backwards for its frontline employees. Management isn’t treated quite as equal but it’s because all efforts go into ensuring that the representatives are truly overly taken care of.
good,"Great benefits, health care and beyond. Work enviorment is good, learning and development programs from front line employees to upper management are very good."
good,A typical day as a billing rep at Comcast include non stop incoming calls from customers new and current. My job to sell cable answer billing questions add services or delete service and put in disconnect services.
good,Comcast is a good company to work for.  Great pay and benefits .. The customers can be difficult sometimes but that all in the job. You are off major holidays and off on Sundays..
good,"Comcast was a great company to work for. Great medical benefits, great work-life balance. Tremendous stock options along with great team chemistry and great advancement work opportunities."
good,"a typical day at work first starts off with critical thinking even though going through multiply hours of great training when being on the phone its just you and the customers every decision you make can either resolve the situation or make it worse, also problem solving in shortest time frame is essential at the end of the conversation my main goal was to always make sure the customer was satisfied withe their service and their devices were working properly."
good,"Hard working environment. Good training and the benefits are great. The ability to grow within the company is very high if you put in the work. You will find that with Comcast, you can reach you goals. company vehicle is provided with the tools to do your job."
good,"They are focused on numbers and not you as a person,, no matter how well you perform your job, come in everyday and on time don't get me wrong they have good benefits which is why I stayed."
good,If you are a hard worker you can definitely make a lot of money working door-to-door with Comcast. You have to be driven without being supervised on the field. Sometimes the supervisor would shadow us to review our strategy and give their feed back. The supervisors are great with leading you in the right direction and alway available/ open to help. I truly enjoyed working there but it's not the job for single moms. I worked very late hours Monday- Friday and was asked to work some weekends.
good,Great environment to work in and wish i could have been there longer if they had not done away with the role that I held. The hours were great and loved the work schedule of Monday-Friday and the hours were awesome.
good,The company itself truly values it's employees and community. Management is well trained and it's easy to develop relationships with everyone working there since you can all related to the stress of working in a call center.
good,Fast paced environment with a family culture. Expectations are clear and achievable. The pay is acceptable for the expectations. A great holiday party every. The whole company supports the community once a year.
good,"Good company to work for, Great management in the Augusta location pay not very high in comparison to its competitors. Provides the best service should be able to employers more than its copetitors"
good,"Work was in a Call Center.  Received and processed orders and provided technical information to customers. "
good,Very good do your job left alone. Do training  have tech meeting tech night out all good all uniform and boots pay for .All you need is to come.To work and perform your job. Grea
good,its a great place to work the benefits are great as well you will meet alot of new people as well as work with team to accomplish goals that are set . every job has it ups and downs
good,Comcast was family oriented business and believed in balance. The Company allowed you to grow your career within. Benefits were top-notch. Great incentive programs to build morale in the workplace.
good,"Fun place but performance metrics penalties to stringent, failure to meet consequences for non gross abuse or intentional mis-conduct is to severe. Training is too stream lined, margin of errors as a result varies rep to rep, but all rated the same. Coaching practices not adequate enough."
good,"Great company, great benefits  The work load is somewhat manageable ..But the opportunities to move up are very slim.  Especially in the management sector."
good,"Wonderful company to work for.And they do reward for hard work with concert tickets,new clothing & recognition.The culture is amazing & you really want to do your best."
good,"always ahead of the competition,good salary and benefits.Company focused on customer satisfaction provided good morale for their employees.Personal issues that arise were handled properly."
good,"Great benefits, High turnover rate, No room for advancement once in your role. Favoritism for people who management liked.  They did let us work outside sometimes."
good,"A daily work day is logging into all systems and taking inbound calls from customers. A typical call is troubleshooting service, or going over billing."
good,"I worked there for 18 years in a variety of different departments,  it is a good company to work for.  I enjoyed my time there. if given the opportunity I would do back"
good,"Within itself Comcast is a company that is not for the faint hearted, and it developed strength and skill within any and all workers who apply themselves that has a strong pay off."
good,"I worked here for many years and enjoyed it. It could get stressful at times especially when your a manager like I was. However, it was worth it because the pay was great due to the fact that I was a self contractor. I worked at my own pace and made my own hours, and made my own schedule. There was never a week that I made less than 1000.00 but I worked my butt off."
good,A great overall place to work. They take care of all employees. Great career advancement. Great job security. The bonuses are greatly appreciated and are good amounts
good,A typical day at Comcast was enjoyable. I learned a lot of great skills at Comcast. I think they should do a better job when choosing leaders(supervisors). Workplace culture was good. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the elements. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with some great people.
good,"Comcast was an experience i wouldn't trade for anything. I grew as a professional and in my personal life as a result of the time I spent there. Now that isn't to say it was at all an easy environment for success. You'll need to be thick skinned and focused on your goals at all times, or you're going to get swamped and hate your job."
good,"It was my first time working in a bpo company, bpo virgin should I say. Compensation was great and the ""work-environment"" was all knew to me, but I had fun. I was able to use my interpersonal communication skill talking to the customer over the phone."
good,"Plenty of room for advancement provided you meet the required metrics, which change often. Excellent benefits and work/life balance. Great teamwork and safety-first culture."
good,"Everyone is really cool and one big happy family. Meet up meetings in the morning and work through the night. "
good,"I was always treated fairly and with respect, they always made sure my family was ok when things went south, made to many modifications to the salary to make it worth staying."
good,"Call center sales environment. Its fun, but can get stressful when youre doing everything you can and customers still tell you no. Still would recommend."
good,- New professional experience for me.
good,"Comcast has transformed into a software platform company and are implementing innovative technologies in th areas of content delivery and OSS/BSS"
good,Took  inbound calls from comcast customers and assisted them with any issues they had on their account
good,Is a great place to work for when you find your best place at working for. I can'r get a hundrrain???????????????????????????????????????ed and fifty charters out of my b
good,"Comcast gets a bad rap from customers, but it is a great place to work and they really take care of their employees.  I can't recommend Comcast enough as a fantastic place to work."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to complete your job/task without being micromanaged, team members are also willing to work together to finish daily tasks if they have completed tasks in their designated areas."
good,I really loved working for Comcast and was a really fun place to be. Employees at Comcast are very engaging and friendly. Overall its a great place to grow professionally.
good,I definitely loved the independence that the managers and company provided. Decisions made were mainly based on the decision of the Representative. The most enjoyable is the pay. Hardest part of the job would be getting mistreated by angry customers.
good,"Through my time with Comcast I had the pleasure to be a part of a number of strong teams under strong leaders. As with any company there are a few bad apples but overall, there is a wonderful atmosphere. It is a company that allows its agents to step up and lead when needed and tries (as best as a large corp can) to listen to their front line."
good,"Very competitive pay, great work environment stressful job but company does a lot to deal with that. Managers are exceptional always help On floor when needed. Everything is taught in training and tons of room fo advancement."
good,Good overall environment. Great benefits.  Lots of management turnover due to constant changes on company direction based on competition and some past poor customer service issues.
good,great place to work with amazing benefits but there is little opportunity to advance in the company the do give many incentives and bonuses throughout the year
good,Comcast has a diverse company culture and despite what the majority thinks.. the company really listens to their employee concerns and caters to the demands of their customers.
good,"Commission is great. You are able to control how much you make vs the work you put into it. I promise if you put work into it, unlike other companies, you will be compensated. You're pitching a dying product, but if you get creative and network, you'll be able to build a pipeline and makes sales."
good,company is very reliable and treats their employees with excellent care and gratitude. a lot of room for growth within the company in any department desired.
good,Pretty good place to work. Very team oriented folks. Training is top of the line. Daily changing opportunities. Must be a hard worker to work here. great place to work.
good,"This is a high energy and productive place to work. If you like to set your salary and control the outcome of your pay, this is the ideal place for you to work."
good,installing and trouble shooting internet/alarm systems/phoneViop and falling up with unhappy customers as well as checking up with team member and assisting and training them on product. I learned to adapt working with younger group of technician and also to be pro active as I was their team lead. It became a great place to learn and exceed and becoming very recognized and pro active young crew.The hardest part was leaving and most enjoyable part was working as one.
good,was a good place to work.taking calls and making sales.my supervisor was very helpful in assisting me when in need. great atmosphere to work in. I enjoyed coming to work
good,Overall company environment was good. Produce sufficient equipment and team was very cooperative. Team lead will clear everything and company's work environment was also good.
good,"I worked at Comcast from Sept. '09 to Sept. '16 and it is a great company. I worked in two different states, in four different departments, had one non-leadership role and was then promoted...and had four leadership roles before I left. I only left the company because I got engaged and moved to a non-Comcast area."
good,I enjoy the fast paced environment.  Management always has something going on to relieve the monotony of the day. The benefits are excellent and I enjoyed working with my supervisor and the management team.
good,"Working here everything revolves around internet, television, and phone these are things used on a daily basis in life. So we had to know what was on TV and how to use the internet. This made it fun because there were always new shows coming on and so it would be made into a new opportunities and incentives to up sale and know how to sale effectively."
good,Having face to face interactions with customers is my favorite part of the day. Having face to face interactions with customers is also the hardest part of my day. For the most part my day is enjoyable. Every company has things you wish were different.
good,"A typical work day can be slow at times, but it is a very fun environment where you are nurtured into you position rather than thrown in. There are many incentives to do your job and you get paid well to do what you do..."
good,Comcast is a great place to work I love the benefit  the atmosphere was really a great atmosphere the managers were great fun to be around good to talk to my coworkers were really cool people. How will recommend to anyone to work there Comcast's The discounts of really good with Comcast and I will feel that Comcast is one of the greatest communication television companies in the world
good,"Constant but controllable workload, pleasant to work with fellow employees and management. Leaves you with a feeling of Accomplishments. Would be helpful to assist with training of new products to assure customer approval ratings stay high."
good,It's a good job but the pay can be better they will also work and make sure you are ready to be working and provide you with all the tools you need...
good,"The retention department was great. Amazing leaders, from first line supervisors all the way to the site director. You have an open line of communication from bottom to top. Comcast says they're invested in making customer service their number one product, and this Department lives that. The only downside is that not every department lives the same values, and customers get mistreated before getting to retention sometimes."
good,"The company cares about their employees and their culture. They seek out feedback, and look to be held accountable to it. They have systems in place across all area's of business, with checks and balances which cover this in great detail which rise all the way to the top of the corporate ladder."
good,"The motto around the office is work hard and play hard. Production expectations are high but our leadership always finds ways to celebrate our hard work and provide activities for team building and camaraderie. Every month a team sponsors office wide activities, from wacky (fortune cookie day) to purposeful (cancer/suicide awareness days). I highly recommend working here."
good,Ready for a change. Its been a long time at Comcast. Comcast has been a good employer but after many years its has gotten hard to stay positive. Thanks
good,"a typical day at work is pretty routined , and repative , learned ALOT! from peers and mangment , Hardest part is working from 2-11 with young children at home. enjoying part was going home to them sadly they were always in bed already"
good,"There are a lot of great benefits working for Comcast, they train you for most jobs for 6-8 weeks and offer great medical/dental/vision insurance after only 90 days as well as paid time off. Unfortunately, most people in the technical support division have no flexibility and are given mandatory 3pm-midnight shifts without weekends off, so having a work/home life balance is difficult. Also, Comcast has such a negative reputation that in trying to change that opinion with customers, they do not protect their agents in any way. Employees have no recourse when profanity, slurs, etc are used by customers as there are rarely managers available and an agent is never, ever to disconnect from the call, no matter how abusive a customer is. While I completely agree in being polite, courteous, and giving great customer care, measures must be in place to protect agents as well."
good,Comcast enables the involvement of highly complex situations while encouraging freedom to apply innovative thinking and solutions daily.  I thoroughly enjoy being granted the opportunity to identify work gaps and brainstorm and execute on creative solutions and alternatives.
good,I had an experience working there with billing and being tech support learned things I didn't know being I was s customer as well it was a experience I would never forget
good,Comcast is a great place to work. You are giving a lot of vacation time.  Awesome benefits and great pay. Career advancement is available. Discounts of services are also a great perk.
good,"Entrepreneurial culture.  If you have an idea, you can pursue it, but be careful not to overburden yourself!  The people are fantastic.  Amazing that the company has gathered extremely smart and credentialed individuals who are also friendly and collaborative."
good,"I really hate that my department moved away. I would have retired from Comcast. Great atmosphere, easy job, great pay and lots of other great perks for being a Comcast employee."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Comcast.  \The benefits were excellent, and I enjoyed my job.  As a Check In Rep I would spend my day auditing work done by the contractors that worked for us.  I would still be doing that today if they hadn't moved my job up north.  Being a customer account executive (CAE) can be stressful.  As a CAE you not only speak with people who want your service, but also people who are upset with their service...and they will take it out on the person who gets their call."
good,"days were long, but the hours did not fit with my schedule to work, comcast cares about its employees and have lots of options for their employers, as far as growth with in the company, 401k, benefits. very diverse culture and all teams grow to be a family"
good,"Great job, very physical, and you better like to work at heights (like I do). Every middle management supervisor was a great guy and all were extremely fair and understanding. Safety is the culture and the word of the day (I'm in !) The only thing lacking was the training on specific inside customer equipment - they needed a lot of work on the training personnel in this area. All other aspects of training and the stress put on safety were right up my alley. The only thing that made me leave was having to train over the telephone - Right there in front of the customers - on equipment being newly installed or old equipment being replaced. I thought it was extremely unprofessional and saw, not a few, customers become uneasy and even irritated. I told my boss Shane that it bothered me and that the company wasn't a good fit for this reason. We parted on very amiable terms."
good,"Comcast offers its employees a lot of good benefits while being within the company. Depending on your location will depend on your cliental basis, which some will be more stressful or higher paced then others. I believe this should reflect in someone's pay but it is not. However, overall, I believe Comcast is a corporation that does look out for their employees a lot more than other companies."
good,"aggressive phone sales"
good,"Daily functions and job responsibilities were variable and atypical.  We had meetings that helped us to changed the course of our day and allowed us to focus on what was most important for that particular day."
good,"Typical day at work would be driving to your first job and either trouble shooting the Customers Cable troubles or installing there Cable, phone or Internet. I have learned a lot about Cable in the short time I have been there. Management is great and always willing to help. Hardest part of the job is understanding other things that affect Cable. One thing I don't like is if you go to a house and fix their issues with the Cable and then something happens out of your control within 30 days it comes back on you."
good,"The work certainly got tedious after a while, solving the same 10 or so basic problems over and over all day gets boring.  But the pay was good, benefits were excellent, most coworkers seemed pretty happy, and management was kind and genuinely interested in developing their subordinates, one of the better jobs I ever had.  Burnout definitely happens, but it beats other entry level jobs by miles."
good,"Great managers, that listens, supportive, and allowed creative ways of selling.To encourage high volumes of sales each month, they would hold contests, that made you want to top your best months."
good,"This is a face paced work place, always changing so be ready for something new.  My supervisor was great!  Always competitions and changes for recognition.  My supervisor was always willing to work with me to help improve my sales skills and get to the next level.  They were accommodating to nursing moms and had private pumping rooms for breaks.  Also had a ping pong table, and game system as well as tv break room and private couch area where you could nap on breaks.  Free coffee station, and concessions you could buy for breaks/lunch.  Be ready to constantly hit goals that are always changing.  Need to be able to handle the sales grind to make money and keep job security."
good,"this is a great company"
good,"What business is not driven by sales when it comes to telecommunications, even when its retention. You can be an agent not making any sales and you will still get paid. "
good,Being an Admin at Comcast was a good job but they do not always recognize all the hard work an Administrative Assistance does on behalf of the company.
good,"The only thing that was not great was supervisors, they are not really professional. Overall, it was a well paid job. Also, if you just graduated from high school this would be a good place to work at 18 of age."
good,"You will have to work independently once your training is over. Even though understand how to do your job is easy dealing with upset customers, the weather, and cramp crawl spaces can be challenging"
good,"Assist clients with service changes, educate on new service options, and schedule at home visits with installation professionals.	Resolve client inquiries, dealing with all types of inquiries including billing issues, installation schedules, and new product information"
good,"answering phone calls for 8 hours give customer service and empathy to each customer as well as escalate upset and angry customers, problem solve issues and answer billing questions, take payments give credits when needed help other associates when needed"
good,"great place to work. In the 5 years i was there I was able to be promoted 6 times. The only issue is once you're certified in all the products they can be very haphazardous in your routing, demanding that you be on two jobs in a two hour time frame not considering the drive time between the two jobs is almost an hour."
good,I spend my whole work day on the phone for inbound calls. Most of the call were good. but every now and then they were really tough. I learned how to not get upset when people called angry. Not to take everything so personal.
good,"Troubleshooting & educating for both internal & external customer over Comcast equipment & Services."
good,Decent job. If you're a patient person and you're pretty good at sales and customer service then this is the job for you. Even if not there are many other jobs available.
good,"Comcast needs to put the customer first. I did this and would get tapped on the shoulder saying well you can't do this or that. I said I'm here for the customer as a customer service rep. I did enjoy my job, but they closed the Fort Wayne office."
good,A typical day starts with logging into the computer then is a pre-shift meeting lasting 15-13 minutes. After that you get on the phone and start selling. Management can be a hit or miss. My experience has always been pleasant. Supervisor is very help and will do whatever is necessary to help succeed in sales. The hardest part is the selling to customers who are already set up with what they need but learning is a part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pot lucks and double commission days. The job is what you make it.
good,"I understand a company wanting to stay a few steps ahead, but this company lost all focus on employees and totally went for the $$.  It does have the best internet service pretty much hands down as far as I am concerned, but I tried Direct TV for TV service once and I do kind of like its recording features better than just on-demand. Again, though one might say Comcast is a little too aggressive in trying to stay ahead and because of its outsourcing for customer service reps, it does lose some points in the Customer Service area. When using its own employees for that job, things go a lot smoother and people can actually deliver what they talk about but with the outsourcing, there is a disconnect which can leave a bad taste in one's mouth."
good,this is a great place to work if you like learning; each day is slightly different. the task that needs to be accomplished bares similarities day to day but the environment changes prompting a keen ability to adapt to those changes in order to be effective.
good,"Comcast benefits was outstanding. opportunities very good, there lots of training and all work tools were provided. the team I worked with was very professional"
good,"The job itself is not bad, it's dealing with angry customers that's not fun. My location's management always put customers at the forefront. There are a lot of bad eggs that work for the company which does not help with customer relations."
good,"Had a lot of growth opportunities here and lots of training that was easily accessible to all employees to help further knowledge and promoted growth for all benefiting the customers and employees. Great professional environment. Ping pong table, basketball court, volley ball court, pool table available for breaks and lunches. Lots of catered food especially for meetings."
good,The company truly cares about you as a person. Benefits and work life balance are amazing. Structure of company could use some work and seems difficult to move up in the organization.
good,I really enjoy working with Comcast. The company is amazing and the people hired are carefully selected to reflect what is needed for the customers. Growth is possible and it is different than your typical call center. It does implement many changes that is to be expected with call center environments. The company takes care of their employees.
good,"he majority of my experience has been favorable. In the past, I've had several leaders who were passionate about developing their direct reports. I'd love to see the front line leadership team receive more support and development from upper management than they do currently. My department has recently experienced a high turnover of well-qualified leaders, greatly due to a poor work/life balance and feelings of under-appreciation"
good,Comcast is a great place to work.  Everyone gets along and they have great incentives for everyone.  The moral is great and excellent benefits.  Work load is balance and great learning tool
good,"Fast paced and productive work environment was something I enjoyed, also having a good company benefits and great employees made the experience pleasant."
good,Whenever you need something or need help with anything management is always there to lend a hand and help you any way desire. My management has been very helpful and understanding.
good,Great place to work and people always seem positive and upbeat when it suits them. Management is management usually half actually do work and the others pretending but it's an forever changing environment.
good,"A typical day for me at Comcast consist of setting daily goals, gathering with the piers and management for motivation before the start of my shift, and preparing to have a great of sales and customer experience."
good,"Comcast offers a great benefits package for employees including vison, dental, medical, and 401K matching. The salary is not that great but the benefits make up for it."
good,"great company to work for"
good,If the compensation was better it would be the perfect place to work. The management is great and professional. The benefits are perfect as far as the cable discount.
good,"Great outdoor workout - with climbing, working with tools and pulling cable and securing it. You have to work well independently, though having to call in to the hub in Atlanta is problematic. It is always better to have a more regionally located hub. Generally a good bunch of guys and gals working the lines. The training is premium up to where you go into the houses to work with the customers equipment. They need a better and deeper training program for customer home use equipment. I really liked the job and miss the climbing, but, I'm 58 and was 56 at the time I worked for them. I felt pretty sure that I would be climbing until I couldn't climb strongly anymore."
good,"Great benefits, great place to work. A very diverse company and advancement is available. Has a great product for consumers. Does a great job at marketing their products as well"
good,"door to door territory sales. I am assign a territory to door on non active customer.

good,"Comcast is a wonderful company to work for I really appreciate what I learned working there. I really liked my colleagues  Some Supervisors need some help in managing a team and being honest! If you qualify for any time such as FMLA where a Dr. reviewed your case and you're qualified to get it the supervisor shouldn't be personal about it. On the Corporate end I was very satisfied on how things worked with Comcast. I was provided with many opportunities in making money &  incentives awesome benefits were great too, I know Comcast doesn't practice any employee being treated unfairly but they need to watch some of their Supervisors.

On a busy day we  take about 45 to 60 calls a day. All my co workers were so friendly and supportive especially if you needed assistance dealing with a complicated call or billing issue. To be honest I really can not answer the hardest part of the job because if I came across an account or etc  that was a little complicated I try to figure it out myself I love the challenge, but if I couldn't I would get assistant from my supervisor or one of my co workers.

good,"Comcast  cable high pace technical call center"
good,"A typical day at work was selling customers cable, phone and internet services. I would go door-to-door and at the end of the day place orders with Comcast. I learned to persevere and keep a great attitude. The management and co-workers were great. I would say the hardest part of my job was trying to sell to customers locked in a contract with another company and the best was the sense of accomplishment after I would get a sale."
good,"Typical day begins with picking up equipment from warehouse, then continuing to scheduled appointments for installation and troubleshooting. Both managers and co-workers treat you like family and do their best to help out every one around them. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with the drastic changes in weather, it can become overwhelming sometimes. Getting to meet new people at every appointment is the biggest perk of working for Comast."
good,I worked at Comcast for a long time. I only left because of a dynamic shift in my family life.
good,"As with anything else your view of the company will depend on what department you work for and the management. Overall Comcast as a whole is a good company with great benefits. In recent years they have been working very hard to commit to their ""open door"" policy by keeping workers informed of the good, bad and ugly which I commend them for. Promotions are usually done by moving out of our current department, there needs to be more done with those in management who do not support their teams career goals for advancement due to their own lack of meaningful employee relations and disregard of individual development; however it can be found by joining the affinity groups which are all very excellent and is the best part of my experience."
good,"My day depends on my ability to get appointments. It would start as early as 8 - 9 am and end as late as 9 - 10 pm. My territory is from Crossville, TN to Bristol, TN. Many hours of travel time, which I do not mind."
good,"A typical work day at comcast is for me is answering at least 60 calls per day. Taking a customer who is upset and sometimes confused and making them laugh and calming the situation. Resolving the situation and if I can't making sure that I find someone who can. Answering billing concerns, upgrading, services, adding new services, trouble shooting video and some internet repairs. I've learned to treat people the way I wanted to be treated and that when a customer is not happy about a situation it is not personal they are not upset with me but the situation and to put myself in there shoes. Most calls we receive are not people who call in to tell you that you are doing a good job and to let you know how happy they are but they have a situation that needs to be resolved and that's where I give 100% of me to resolve and make them a happy customer. I have been fortunate to have a management team who really care about their employees and work to make sure that we are at the best in our field that we can possibly be. My co-workers have become like family sometimes you see them more than you see your own family so began to grow a certain bond. We don't mind assisting each other when needed. The hardest part of the job for me is not being able to satisfy all customers . I know you can't satisfy everyone but it doesnt mean I can't try. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when customers tell me that I have made them feel better about their situation and have resolved. It just feels good to know that you have made some one smile and have made them a satisfied customer no matter"

One day the HBO rep will stop by with new information, promotion or new season previews and you will have a contest for HBO sales for the day, the next day ma be focused on sales techniques, it is a great place to work if you like to be busy and feed of off the energy around you. They are great to their employees with benefit fairs, educational opportunities, sales training, and management opportunities. The Hardest part of the job is that you cannot have a ""bad"" day or let whatever you have going on at home come to work with you, there is no room for that."

A typical day for me would be to come in and make my sales team better by coming up with strategies and implementing them in coaching sessions. I sit down with my employees on a daily basis, coaching them up to exceed any personal goals they have set for themselves."
good,"Was part of debugging team; our responsibilities included bugtracking, as well as bug resolution."
good,You feel like you part of something bigger. If allowed without time constraints many more people could be helped. Its called customer service. Allow the Reps to do their job to the fullest. Don't Just go by script. Think outside the box to help people. I wish I had been allowed to go beyond script. Great pay and benefits though.

good,"Comcast is a good company with great benefits such as Dental, 401K Plans, Vision."
good,Comcast is a great cable company with a fast paced environment. Comcast is always introducing new products and focused on growing revenues.
good,A typical day at work consists of talking to about 80 to 100 customers.
good,Management in my department is excellent. The usual work day consists of taking between 40 and 70 inbound calls with quotas for sales. The job has taught me to adapt quickly on the fly and how to handle customer issues quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job is the bad customers you do take some abuse. The good part is when you can help people get what they need and are appreciative of your help.
good,"Managers and supervisors are fair. The company tries to allow for internal advancements for its people. Hours are harder to get what you want, but the jobs are there for those that put in the time and hard work can advance."
good,Worked at this employer thru a temporary staffing company.
good,Its a great company to work for but the job is ruff and you can't let the customer complaint to you.
good,It was a good company but the management was a bit to stricted And was very clicky with the groups of managers and employees there.
good,"I would have stayed if they did not decide to close the department and move to Detroit Michigan. It was a great company to work for, health benefits were great, hours were right on par."
good,"One of the great perks of Comcast is that you get free cable, internet & phone plus 401k is 100% vest at the start and they have good health benefits."
good,Comcast is a really great place to work ! I get lots of vacation and flex time off to explore other things in my life. They will help out a little with going back to school. Comcast really promotes growth and hiring from within and quickly. They really make it a nice chill place to work with fun opportunities to win things at work.
good,Flexible schedules fun atmosphere. Did not like the sales and marketing portion of this position.
good,I enjoyed my stint at Comcast. The job was challenging and fun and management allowed me to try new things to bring in accounts.
good,"Great place to build a career, with the number of locations and the ""promoting within"" philosophy there is ample opportunity to advance. One of the companies many benefits is tuition reimbursement which can help develop your career while attending college for area you may choose."
good,"Loved working there, unfortunately, my job was eliminated."

good,"Awesome place to work, collaborate, innovate, grow and learn. Good compensation and benefits. Comcast cares day is a great way to help your local community."
good,Management is wonderful. They really help you achieve your goals. Everyone is friendly and willing to help you in anyway possible. Everyone feels like family.
good,"I enjoy everything I do, when I'm doing it. I take proud in my work. etc. "
good,"Leadership oriented workplace, an open-door policy with managers, lots of room for growth and specialization, value in diversity, find your niche and you will excel."
good,"Company tries to take are of you. The free video and internet package makes up for a little bit lower pay, it offsets. Most opportunities for advancement are in the Denver area"
good,I've been here for 2+ years and I definitely see the improvement on the diversity here. Friendly leaders and people appreciate working here! I would like to thank the new leaders that took my suggestions into consideration. Having bi-monthly employee surveys helps make the job a comfortable place to work.
good,"It was a good job to work for I learned alot . Picked up alot of skills and worked alot of overtime  and it had a 10% night pay differential "
good,"meeting days are on all wednesday that is includes equipment pick ups"
good,"Coaching and mentoring employees to meet the expected KPI goals ."
good,job is coo but it's stressful you just gotta be on your heels working here its just so many changes at the job things change in the blink of the eye. I was working here for a year and it is just that the company do require things to get harder and harder due to the changes but its a good job
good,It was fun working with my mentor on day to day basis. People were very helpful even for trivial things. Great work life balance. Compensation can be better
good,I completely agree with Comcast being rated as a great place to work! Excellent benefits and career advancement opportunities. Leaders focus on development and providing a great employee experience.
good,"One of the best companies to work for in terms of benefits but work environment is extremely stressful."
good,"Got to work with some amazing people helping to build products that interacted and impacted with millions of people."
good,"Great place to work. Potential for advancement in industry leading Company.  Progressive culture, best in class products. Complete benefits package. Company on the rise !"
good,"Comcast is outstanding, even with the bs, as every job has. Comcast allows you to use time off after 90 days. However you must go through 13 weeks of training with no time off. the training is both field and class. They make sure you know your stuff before releasing you to do the job. Once a week is a meeting with your team to discuss upcoming and current changes. The discounts are amazing with over 500+ dealers. Pay is fair and you can take home your equipment and van."
good,"I loved working for Comcast, i only left because i moved to out of state. The customers might hate you but the company really helps the employees manage their stress."
good,Great place to work unless you get into trouble. The hardest part was installing cable. The 28 foot ladder is quite heavy.  The customers can be great to deal with or extremely difficult .Comcast customer service is lacking and the customers usually take out their frustrations on the service techs.  Be prepared to be yelled out for no reason from customer.
good,"Occasionally slow but frequently fast paced with little room to breathe. There is a lot of support available but it can sometimes be difficult to receive a quick response. Lots of room for advancement and opportunity to earn extra income via commission on top of hourly rate. Most difficult part about this job is dealing with highly irate customers. Metrics can be difficult as well but once you get used to them it can become easier, however job responsibilities were continuously added. Teams have a 'family' vibe, near daily meetings with group and weekly individual visits with supervisor. Frequent additional paid training. This company makes a phenomenal effort to ensure you are physically and mentally comfortable, via mental health benefits and ergonomic workstations. "
good,"I've been working with Comcast for a couple of years. If you enjoy residential sales, and are disciplined in your approach, you can do extremely well."
good,Comcast is a great place to work. The management is supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help employees. Training is sufficient to preform the job.
good,"Technicians would drive the customer's home to service and install and repair cable tv and internet services. Must be able to interact to customers to troubleshoot their cable related issues.Management  provide tools for the technicians to succeed. The hardest part of the job would be ladder work,crawling under houses,crawling into extremely hot attics,working in extreme weather(ex:rain,hot weather,snow,etc). The best part of the job is when the customer is smiling and happy because you fixed their cable issue."
good,"I loved engaging with a variety of people on a day to day basis along with the ability to provide them excellent service at affordable pricing. This job is not easy! You must have people skills, time, patience and empathy for current, former and potential customers."
good,"Days include email notifications / updates, scrums and assigned tasks.  I ate lunch while i worked then had an afternoon workout break."
good,It was a fun and great place to work many options available and good pay and benifits. The job can be demanding and stressful at times but overall not bad.
good,comcast is a good place to work. the management is awesome and the pay and benefits are even better. answering inbound calls and doing outbound cold calls. it is a call center job and a collections job so you would be at a desk all day and you do handle very angry people on a daily basis
good,"I liked working at Comcast. The only thing about Comcast is at the time my schedule could require shift changes. I was in school on campus. I sent my school schedule according to my first schedule. When it switched, I had to quit."
good,"This job never stopped, this job is always going to have something for you to do.  You will always have a way to show what type of worker you can be.  You will be able to show your skills."
good,"For all sakes and purposes, Comcast holds a very competitive pay and gives you many hours to work with benefits and opportunities to take care of yourself. "
good,"i am not intersted in posting this review. But for some reason, indeed is requiring me to do so. comcast was a great place to work. so i hope this meets the guidelines"
good,Loved the challenge of learning new projects to work on.  Learned how to run and work on analyst reports for Director and Area VP. Enjoyed making all the Travel Accommodations for everyone and working with the different Hotel Sales Reps.. Loved being the Special Event Coordinator..  Enjoyed working with some great people that have become good friends. Etc.
good,Comcast had wonderful incentives to work diligently and was always finding new ways to help agents get the sales they needed. Overall a decent company to work for.
good,Room for growth. I would recommend comcast to anone looking to start a carrer with this company currently operating in 47 states . Yearly bonues great discounts for working here.
good,"I loved working here. The employees were amazing and the management was always there if anyone needed help with anything. For the most part, the customers were extremely nice and patient."
good,"I worked at a few call centers and have also heard about other call center environments in the area,  and comcast  (xfinity mobile) is the most laxed environment, while I was there,  a lot of new supervisors not from within company,  out sourced. So,  while I was there,  supervisors just getting started and learning themselves,  so did not have sup's over shoulder watching every move,  that could change.  Since the job is kinda entry level,  with high pay,  and great benefits,  attendance is very strict. Make sure you take care of your PTO time,  after your first 90 days, and don't have more than two instances in your first 90 days, whether it's just a couple minutes late. You do get your own space,  but you have to be willing for a lot of change,  and be flexible,  cause they are expanding and growing. They hire a lot of people wanting supervisor positions,  and who have experience with the promise to possibly be promoted,  yet they hire from with out for new sup's. So there is definitely a competitive spirit about the staff, everybody looking to be promoted. There is room for promotion to more experienced positions, like tier 2, tier 3, advanced, fraud, if you don't have a written or final attendance warning. If you have three occurances within first 90 days, no advancing. Holidays are required,  if it is call centers turn, and if you are scheduled.  Also,  you will have to work your way into schedule you want.  You do get comp'd services, besides xfinity mobile. Be ready for a lot of uptraining on a regular basis. Be able to work with many many different systems,  problem"
good,"fun environment and incentives, management was great, commission was good. Work place environment was good, just with sales there was a lot of pressure to be able to sell products and meet quota."
good,There are many benifits working for the company. I am a bit dissappointment I inted in dome of the health benifits. Schedule options for a new employee is working nights and weekends.
good,"Comcast is trying hard to improve the way their customers perceive them, but it is like turning a battleship with a teaspoon. Comcast was the only company I have worked for that actually makes changes bases on employee feedback."
good,"They really try their best to make it an enjoyable place to work. I had great supervisors, a wonderful management team, and an awesome mentor. The only issue is that while I expected change, they would make changes that made the job stability questionable. They have a great benefits package, great incentives that are actual attainable. Working loyalty is stressful. There’s no avoiding that. Just know that your uppers have worked your position and they do understand."
good,"The courtesy service position required constant learning which I found enjoyable and challenging.  I interacted with local employees, division employees in Denver and occasionally HQ employees in Philadelphia.  I also worked with outside contractors."
good,"Comcast is a typical corporate job with many different departments and functions. To work here an employee will have to embrace change and constant stress. Their benefits package is robust with full benefits, employee perks and discounts, 401K and stock purchase plans. There are opportunities for advancement but for the most options an employee would consider relocating and changing job functions."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Comcast. Installations always kept me engaged, because no two places are exactly the same. It also allowed me to meet a lot of people I otherwise wouldn't have. The pay was more than enough to cover cost of living in my area, and the benefits are great as well. The only real downside was too much micromanagement going on from time to time."
good,"Working for Comcast has its caveats as with any job. However, the overall on them is that its an exceptional opportunity should you be offered a position. Can improve and provide avenues for upward mobility even if not with them long term"
good,"I miss working for Comcast every day! Had to leave to family and medical reasons. Unfortunately, it was more than a year had to leave and company policy was that I had to give up my position. Would work for them again any time or day!!"
good,Café gratis por las mañanas y excelente compañía durante la jornada laboral.
good,"At times you would have verbally abusing customers, but that is part of the job in call centers. Most if not all coworkers are nice. From time to time employees would have arguments and management was always fair. Sometimes we would be under maned and over worked, but again that happens sometimes."
good,"Get route in morning and go out and execute."
good,"Great place to work.  They do take care of employees by offering quarterly bonuses. They have job related functions to show employee appreciation.  Only con, advancement is supposed to be based of individual performance metrics, but the guidelines are not always followed causing works to miss out on performance raises."
good,Great job competitive pay. Really great work/life balance. All around good company to work for. Worked  four 10 hour days and it was Sunday through Wednesday and had every Thursday Friday and Saturday off.
good,Comcast was a great company to work for the only issue was the pay was not the greatest while the management was good and the expectation was set in your review.
good,"Comcast Spotlight was full of friendly people who made it feel like home. It was a great company to start your career. With determination, there are many opportunities for career advancement."

good,worked 3 party vendor  tlk was the worst place ever to work for soo....no money and no benefits job for someone who just got highschool not an adult raising a family
good,"Comcast was a great experience for me, especially to be working in Comcast One.  Management was interesting because the team I was on was scattered, rather than all being in the same location which made it a little bit harder to learn."
good,"The C in Comcast stands for change, so if you don't adapt well to change or aren't a change champion, or looking to become one - Comcast isn't the place for you. The change makes it so much fun!"
good,great benefits and my immediate superiors were willing to work with me for Work/Life balance. Incentives were given to help support a happy working environment.
good,"I was a high school intern and had just turned 17 so i honestly wasn't asked of much.. My two supervisors would just give me fairly simple tasks each day for me to complete during my 4-5 hour shift. I was fortunate enough to interact with a lot of the other employees/interns and learned something from each one i spoke with.. Very diverse setting, very humble and knowledgeable staff"
good,"Typical day for me consisted of addressing problems of customers. It was fast paced, but I didn't feel overworked and an overabundance of stress. "
good,"This company is a that sets you up with cable, internet, home phone and home security systems. It is easy to start someone off with services but it can be difficult to deal with angry customers. There is no training for getting call foul names."
good,as customers come into the store you deal with any concern they may have. We explain billing conduct cable box exchanges and then attempt to convert these maters into a new sale for Comcast.
good,"It was a pretty laid back atmosphere until customers cable went out, then it became pretty fast pace as we diligently rushed to fix the problem. we celebrated birthdays and had pot luck dinners. People would volunteer to cover shifts when people where unable to work,"
good,"Tough life, Comcast tech support- you get yelled at, the customers seem to always be angry; but on the bright side, your paid well, and get practically free services."
good,"Nice place, very relaxed but you have to be ready to learn more each day. Everyday is different. Management will put you on the right path to learn more. The hardest part about the job is that you never know what the next day would consist of. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I make customers smile when their services are restored. Just knowing that I can control everything at the tip of my fingers is a bit of a rush but I love it."
good,Technology is a plus must have great customer service skills. Not for the meek strong sales background a must. Must be able to be the calm during the storm. Understanding and empathy
good,"the culture is great, management does care about you. but it is the hardest most competitive job you'll ever have. you are expected to sell a product that is more expensive than the competition with a very bad company reputation by cold calling. and if you cant make it to a warm lead source during your ramps, start looking for a new job."
good,"Comcast is a good place to work, steady paced atmosphere , energetic call center . Allow you to help customers on a daily basis, good manager supervision"
good,My current employer is high energy and very competitive. We strive for high metrics month to month. The hours adjust every six months which can be difficult.
good,Comcast is a large company with many opportunities for career advancement. Many times you have to start at the bottom and move up however.  The benefits were very competitive.
good,"Shipping and receiving using EIS web portal base , opening  new ticket for ownership request at mintek portal , Pulse inventory sub web portal, accessing online report store for cable history, issuing equipment to technicians,cable stores and contractors, on phone help,resolving issues."
good,Great place to work . I would recommend to anyone.  The hours are great. The people that I work with are some of the best people. Most of all you don't have to worry about transportation.
good,"This was an amazing company to work for.  However, due to the company downsizing and restructuring itself, lay-off were inevitable.  If given the option, I would have retired from Time Warner."
good,"Energetic environment, with competitive incentives. Problem solving abilities are sharpened with each customer interaction. Fast paced with the ability to move up."

good,8-5 Monday to Friday with varied IT tasks and projects. Management was concerned about life style balance. Owner worked in office down the hall and his office door was normally open.
good,"The culture at Comcast has been one of the best experience I’ve had in my working career.   The atmosphere is professional, inviting, & has great pay."
good,"Average day at work would be waking up around your start time, signing in to your phone getting into your van and heading straight to your first job for the day. Overall the pace you can set for yourself as long as you know the job."
good,"This is a great company to work for, employees get the chance to buys some company shares, decent paid time off, and monthly survey to get the inputs of employees."
good,"Working at Comcast was a great place where you can grow within the company.  Hours to pick from comes from seniority, first come first pick. Also always have job security too."
good,"Everyday I meet and exceed monthly goals of Triple Play Sell-in, Xfinity Home Close Rate, Revenue Generating Units Close Rate and Revenue Per Call by consistently greeting customers with a “Can do” attitude, reflecting the specific reason for the customer’s contact, setting the agenda, discovering for all lines of business, transitioning to position a package, focusing on the customer’s needs, explaining the value and benefits of Comcast services, features and added benefits, offering a “Top-Down” approach and overcoming objections."
good,"Advancement opportunities available, fast paced.  Good training, fun work place, good benefits. Good salary, and fun contests.  Overall a great place to work."
good,Always review pending orders before doing following ups or taking that first call on queue. Everyday you would learned something new. Everyone was very helpful. My hardest task was to meet our monthly quota. I had some good months and bad ones. The best part of this job is that not only I met great people I met my best friend who am I still in touch till this day.
good,"Comcast is an excellent place to work to inquire a variety of skill sets under customer service, collections and finance that can be used in various positions"
good,"Highly competing, fun, fast paced environment. Strong partnerships within peers. enticing incentives. Commission based. Very little connection or relationship with management. Sales focused, consistent thought to revenue."
good,Bad schedules automatically assigned hard to balance with a family. Lots of other support and advancement opportunities and job shadowing. Getting pass the 1st year may be the hardest part.
good,"The atmosphere is great at Comcast. Management is very good also. The hardest part about Comcast telesales is job security, cause you are in sales and you do have a quota to reach. But they wont just fire you cause of sales, that takes about 5 months of not reaching your goal to get fired."
good,"As a billing representative with Comcast, you are on the phones and in front of a computer dealing with five to six different programs while speaking to upset customers about their bills. Customers are calling in to either change service, pay bills or discuss wrongdoings on the company's part. The company goes by metrics for points to hit on every single phone call, including sales. The workplace culture was good. There are weekly team meetings to help each representative. The hardest part of the job is definitely having to get yelled at phone call after phone call from upset customers about their bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers and them show gratefulness back to you for helping. A lot of people that call in, don't put into account that the person on the other end of the call is a human being. Some customers really get out of hand when their anger gets the best of them."
good,Great work place you met new people every day you get an hour long break if you have trouble with a job your team will come to your jobsite to help you
good,The environment is exciting. Communication and collaboration between departments for programming are strong. Team members become family. Excellent benefits provided.

good,"Assisting customers with their products and making sure I'm providing them with the service they need"
good,"Preparation is the key in starting your Comcast day.  Have all tools in order, truck gas up, computer fully charged, and you will have an organized and productive day without flaws.  I've learned that the earlier the better, always be 15 to twenty minutes early so that you can prepare yourself mentally for the day's challenges.  Workplace is very competitive and diverse, which makes it very challenging to exceed quotas.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to say know to customer needs, no matter how challenging.  The most important part of my job is customer satisfaction and meeting and exceeding my quotas!"
good,Comcast is a very well balanced company to work for. Many benefits such as health insurance option vision and dental as well as 401K options. The pay was very nice and fair as well with lots of overtime as well.
good,"Working with Comcast was like working at home because you will feel so comfortable. I learned to interact with different kinds of people. The management was nice and approachable and the workplace was incredible! But there were times we were being challenged. Sometimes loads of work-orders will enter our queue, but we were able to manage by being focused and dedicated to our job. The happy and fun part? it was when we have activities and awarding, it was fun because we get to eat a lot of foods while we enjoy the program."
good,"I love Comcast as a job, my co-workers are like a second family to me. We always push each other to better every month. There's not much that I can say I dislike about the job besides the way they change up the commission."
good,They offer great benefits and the compensation is great as well I would advise that if you are going to school currently await until you finish. The flexibility is not that good
good,"The short time I was a DSR here I loved it. They pay really well, job is great, product is best in the business. You can't really say anything bad about it other than unrealistic quotas."

They are empowered to take decision and provide solutions to our end users with the correct partnership and collaboration where information between the groups are exchanged, knowledge are shared to help each other and see the bigger picture. At times, one must step back from the norm of policies and procedures to understand the point of views of our customers or colleagues and that is exactly what my team is empowered to do. There is a strong team spirit within the group, and we all support, trust and respect each other. Open communication and active involvement in the development of the team are important to us, because we want to be successful as a team."
good,"They strive for excellence within and without. They do this by constantly educating their employees. Truth be told, I am hoping to get back in Comcast and retire from them. They are that great a company to work for!!!"
good,"The environment was positive, the management was nice and the team is cool. However, if you don't make it to that level, you'll never truly realize how much of a priviledge it is."
good,Easy Job for the benefits that you get. Great place to learn and grow for the right person. Excellent growth potential.  If you give this place you best self you can strive there.
good,"Comcast treated me pretty well as an intern. The pay was pretty good for an internship. I liked working with my manager. It takes a long time to get the access I needed for some projects. Comcast is a large company, so I'm not too surprised."
good,I grew up at Comcast. I have worked in four incredibly differing departments in the nine years I have been with the company and in that time learned as much about the business as I did myself. The amount of investment Comcast puts toward the advancement of its employees is unsurpassed. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to grow here.
good,"Great job security with benefits and amazing people to work with. The pay was good, yearly increase, just hard to move up with company. Large company if you wanted to move to different location."
