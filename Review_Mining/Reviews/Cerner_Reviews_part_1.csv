rating,review
bad,I worked for this company for two years. It was by far the worst place I have ever worked. I served 8 years in the military before taking a consulting position and hated every minute of it. The management is terrible.
bad,few teams are boring and also just work addicted people in few teams which is really annoying and irritating thing to work in such type of environment
bad,"You can't work enough hours to make anyone happy, its never enough.  The massive amount of overtime makes for no work/life balance.  Check your soul at the door if you decide to work there."
bad,"Management did a poor job of handling internal team issues when they came up, handled confrontation poorly (aka disciplining out of line employees), killed team morale through over work and low pay, and allowing rampant gossip and backstabbing on the team. Expectations for performance were very high and reward for meeting expectations was essentially nothing."
bad,Poor work life balance. Management is poor and they dont care about the personal life. Pure talents are not recognized. And moreover the compensation is not exciting.
bad,"Save yourself the time and bypass  this application. All roles for advancement on a lateral move. Pay sucks don’t let the name fool you, they loosing contracts left and right"
bad,"This Company is full of Racial, Backstabbing folks The Revenue Cycle Department is the bottom of the barrel from the top of the Organization on down."
bad,"Glad I left, only regret I have was staying for too long."
bad,Management is terrible. little to no training. Management doesn’t set examples. Favoritisms. Cerner can deliver to companies what they promise. Losing accounts daily
bad,Poor management from the top down. Too many meetings and competing priorities without clear direction. Culture is stressful and management tends to bully their associates. I would not recommend Cerner Corporation to anyone.
bad,"This company is a perfect place for those still stuck on tired old management philosophies.  The software platforms and coding and product strategy need a complete rebuild.  This is not software built to meet the needs of clinicians.  If you are client-facing, prepare for clinician frustration and fury.  Training is incomplete and just-too-late."
bad,Horrible management never did much for employees gave out no raises and never tried to promote employees. You always have to watch your back because management is always looking to get rid of you.
bad,"Overworked and Underpaid. They have certain people they want in certain positions.  No desire to keep experienced people"" they would rather pay new graduates a lower income. ""Consulting"" is not about just knowing the functionality of the application but ""Consulting"", period.  Knowing how to think outside the box and not just what Cerner told you in training."
bad,"Cerner is going down hill everyday. Every week at least 5 people from the rev cycle department puts in their 2 weeks notice. This has been going on since all the originals who started the company has quit. Stay away! Cerner is not the “the good company to work for” like it used to be! You will not be happy working here! We are supposed to carry lap tops home everyday that we can not use to work from home anymore. We have boat loads of work and never offered overtime. If management does not like you, they will pick at you until they can fire you or you quit."
bad,Lack of communication. Lack of training. Lack of stability. Micro managing seems to be the norm. Underappreciated. The pay is not competitive.  Would not ever recomend Cerner to anyone.  I relocated and moved 2 hours to KC for this job only to be let down. Was told there would be the option to work from home. And that was taken away for only rev cycle.  Flex time is offered but scolded.
bad,Cerner is not a company you should look into being apart of. Management is never there to help you succeed. Expectations in the departments are unrealistic to achieve. The stress level is so high that your personal well being and health will decline.  HR will back management and will refuse to assist in making the department right.
bad,"There’s just too many things wrong with this company to name!! I left a good job because of all the perks that they supposedly offered to their employees; but once hired I quickly found out they were all lies!!!!! In short, I would say do not work!!!!!"
bad,"Would get in trouble if the parking lot wasn't full by 8 am, forced overtime without compensation, salary was so low it was not able to pay all of the bills."
bad,"This job is racist very racist. As an African American, you will get paid less, your White counterparts will try to get you in trouble with your manager every day. Your raise will be shorted each year. You will face unfair and unreasonable working conditions."
bad,"Good starter job for pay. However, often work 60+ hours a week and salary is way below what it should be. Company thinks as consultants are easily replaceable."
bad,"If you come in a 8:00am, skip your lunch, and leave at 6:00pm, you're regarded as a slacker."
bad,"Cerner is a great company to start your career. However, it takes a certain kind of person to rise through the ranks, and not everyone is up to it."
bad,"For a time being its fine to be part of Cerner but not for a longer period, it gave me a good start of my career but not meant to stay further. Hence leaving."
bad,Great company you can learn a lot there. there is not much to say about the trining at all but once you get in there you are taught some things and what to do on the job.
bad,"It was ok, just did not get paid for on call support which could last from 1 to 8 hours at whatever time as well as on the weekends."
bad,"I came to Cerner in the hopes that I would be seeing greener pastures. I was very quick to realize that this was no different that any other corporate job. When interviewing and being shown around the campus I had a very different feeling. It is truly amazing how great they are at selling you on joining their company, but once you are on board things take a very different approach. "
bad,"Long work hours, horrible benefits, job title changes with no salary increase. Management does not want to change anything of the processes for the better"
bad,"I can't say anything nice. I spent 9 years here and they show no respect to those who work hard and devote their time. At the end of the day, I received a huge salary cut and was told to find a different position."
bad,"This place does not care about their employees. I don't recommend this job to anyone, at all. They will hire you for one thing then switch your position quicker than you can say switch."
bad,"Continuous Hamster wheel with no resolution. I expected more from such a big company. No incentives, No compensation for referrals that they hire. Lack of adequate training no consistence in workflows or processes. You learn by trial and error. You are expected to do things that you are not trained to do. Managers 99.9% of the time  can't help or assist you with problem solving."
bad,Employees treated as numbers and not respected. Instead of keeping current employees would rather train new under qualified employees. Salaries were considerably less then competition.
bad,"I just got finished working 125 hours in two weeks and 70 last week.  Pay isn't enough to be screamed at all day every day over things you cannot control.  The hours are long, you live in a hotel, you eat fast food everyday."
bad,"Tired of hearing poor management stories of Cerner. Poor training , partiality towards associates. Learning curve is extremely low. Bad management specially training program. Your graduation is based on the whims of the mentor"
bad,I've learned a lot from this company but the advancement is slow.  Its often times better to get hired in a higher level than to try and work your way up to it.
bad,"The school has gotten progressively worse overtime. Poor management, unkind teachers, unsanitary practices from our kitchen dishwasher, unprofessional environment all around. Don't waste your time here. They call themselves a  ""montessori school"" but when they do manage to get a Montessori teacher hired, the teachers realize what a joke that is and they end up quitting a handful of months later to move onto a real Montessori school. We are nothing but a warehouse for children. The turn over rate here is so extreme most teachers stay for a year, maybe two."
bad,Cerner hires massive training classes (70+ new hires per class). It is tough to learn anything in such huge classes. Managers are young and do not have the experience not the leadership skills to be managers. Co-workers are actually nice and willing to help as much as possible. It is tough to stay motivated at the job when you work for a company that does not care for their employees. I believe that employees are key in all organizations and Cerner is all about the client and not about the employees. I believe that a company should trust their employees with their work instead of be looking over their shoulders all the time.
bad,"only worried about themselves and not growing with the employees...."
bad,"My team and I manage operational and new project tasks. We work with Bisuness Applciations Owners and Architects to provide quaility functionality. I have devleoped structures development, functional and technical processes to improve the way we complete projects and tasks."
bad,"Horrible leadership, it starts at the top and I mean the VERY top!  Google and you will figure that one out.  If you like being micro-managed and working around a bunch of college grads with no social skills and being managed by fear- go for it."
bad,"Leadership is extremely poor.  The metrics kept on all the associates is scary.  Things like the amount of OT each person puts in.  The implicit expectation is a MINIMUM of 20% each week, EVERY week.  Those that grew up with the company know nothing different.  80% of their hiring is college graduates.  Those that make it 2 or 3 years will likely learn to adjust because your life will revolve around Cerner.  There is no work/life balance.  "
bad,"Lack of innovation, creativity, trust from the team members as well as from managers. Join this company If you want to please your managers and listen to whatever they say."
bad,Interview and the hiring process took a lot of time. There was no work-life balance. Management was awful on my team and my supervisor was truly demeaning.
bad,"Cerner is a good opportunity to learn consulting and resource management in a corporate setting, even if your passion isn't in IT/Healthcare/Business.  However it is toxic environment that does not accurately pay for performance.  Spend 2 years to gain experience and learn valuable lessons, and move on."
bad,"I was promised the world when I applied.  Yet during employment my ideas for improvement were overlooked.  It was a clear cut case of ""who you know"" as opposed to your work ethic and production.  They will work you to the bone with no regard of your personal health or home life.  Supervisors were complete idiots.  It boggles my mind how they would hire someone to supervise staff yet they are unable to do the job they are supervising."
bad,Their management sucks... Its all about the relationship with upper management. If you have good relation with upper management you will be good even if you suck at your work. They will ignore all your faults.
bad,"Started here right out of college, and have hated almost every minute of it. Demands are very high, mentoring/support is a joke. They just throw you in the water and see if you sink or swim. "
bad,Cerner has changed alot on the Medical Billing side all perk were taken away no one recieved a merit raise.  They are sending all the work to India. Some of the Associates hired in as Senior Medical biller and they took are titles away.
bad,"The company is a large corporation, that struggles to value their employees - and to empower their associates, without repercussions. Unfortunately, this is why I chose to leave."
bad,"I left a great job to come work at Cerner thinking that I was going into a great opportunity. When I moved my whole life from Texas to KS my contract indicated I was coming in as a traveling consultant with the position fluffed up and presented in such a nice way. After weeks of training me and my majority start group where told we where being placed in another department which was completely different from what we expected and have been training for. Regardless of my experience coming in, I was short-handed badly with management not caring about individuals who moved their whole life for lies and deception. Promptly after arriving at the new department (Upgrade Center) many of us expressed our frustration and not to mention the lack of good training and preparation at the UC. I slowly started looking for a new job after realizing how miserable I was and Thankfully I was able to get a better job back home. Cerner as a whole treats its employees like they are very disposable. They have no regards to your personal career choices and how they screw that up because they are constantly hiring people. My advice to new grads is that if you can't find anything better than Cerner, get your 1-2year experience and start applying somewhere else to better your career because they do not care about you. "
bad,"Being in Management in Cerner, I have constantly see how Cerner does not care about patients or employees. Cerner systems have poor quality and put patient lives at risk. "
bad,"Only people who cannot move out for some reason stay here. Work pressure is RIDICULOUS . Company culture, leads/managers have sweat shop kind of mentality. If you stay in till 3 am in the morning for a code deploy you are still expected to come in at 7 am for your regular work hours. Are you kidding me? "
bad,"Experiences vary across team. My ratings are based entirely on my experiences with the team I was with. "
bad,Cerner expects a minimum of a 48 hour work week. No pictures or plants can be displayed at work.  Business casual no autonomy. Favoritism rules aren’t for everyone. Very political. They expect you to spend your own money and time to put in extra man hours for their foundation.
bad,This company appears solid on the outside but there are many jagged edges within.  Recruitment is top knotch.  This is a ploy to lure good candidates.  It's one of the main reasons there is such a high turnover.  Benefits are not the best and their PTO policy and work/life balance sucks!  It would be a great company if Cerner actually followed it's own mission.
bad,"In regard to my position within Cerner, the culture is to recruit recent college graduates, train them as an Administrative Assistant, and move them up within 6 months. The Administrative Assistant position is looked as an an entry way into the company, not as a career. I did not take the position with Cerner, I had this position with Siemens.  When Siemens was purchased by Cerner, my employer became Cerner."
bad,Cerner Corporation is not a organization I would recommend to anyone. It's culture is very cut throat. They place you on Huge informatics projects and provides little training to be prepared to deal with clients. No a good training program.
bad,Cerner is a certainly a big brand in US and but work culture in Cerner India is very bad and there is no job security.  huge difference between AGC and CTC.
bad,May be mine experience may be same because my company was bought by Cerner. They decided to end our product. So they did not want us. They made it very difficult to work for us & people were pushed out by making it very difficult for everyone.
bad,"Take in a lot of interns and students finishing degrees. However they do not hire on people without a full Bachelors Degree.  Getting an internship with an Associates they will not hold you in an internship til you finish a BA in which case they will terminate your employment."
bad,Experienced techies with more than 5 yrs should never join this company. The management is biased by the mother tongue when it comes to raise and promotion. They run company like some govt agency.
bad,"Came in as a temp - was given no real instruction on duties and they were in no way what I was told they would be by the Agency KForce that placed me here - Did job for over 3 months and was approached by wonderful co-worker that said to me yesterday - heard your leaving - where are you going? I looked dumb founded and said this is the first I heard - WOW - Today is my last day - Yippee - Had some things in the works and not using an agency ever again.  Starting NEW Position next week - Good luck to my replacement."
bad,Management expectations are too high based on work volume & staff resources. They use inexperienced staff to work on accounts instead of hiring employees that have background & skills. Work atmosphere is the same as a high school. Popular people get all advancement opportunities
bad,If your looking for a job and see Cerner  Runas fast as you can its not worth the money.  Your a number in a computer not a person.  I would not recommend anyone apply or work for any company related to Cerner Corp.
bad,Worked for the RevCycle. The job was incredibly unstable. Things changed almost every week. Work flows could change every week. Terrible communication with client. Very unhappy client. Position ended in all jobs terminated because of how unhappy the client was. Management made false promises. Positions hired in at higher compensation than the promotions given for same positions.
bad,"If you even THINK about getting a job within the rev cycle think again! The patient account specialists are treated like scum! We are promised the world while in training to get on the floor and be part of a sinking ship. We aren’t actually “Cerner” employees with how we are treated. Management is a joke in itself, most managers and supervisors are leaving because they know how bad everything is and the ones who are left have no idea how to be a boss! STAY AWAY!"
bad,Never have I felt so deceived by a company as I have by Cerner. Company percs taken away after training is completed. Management reliving their high school days.  Would not recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,The revenue cycle department has gone down the drain. I would not recommend anyone to become apart of Cerner in that department. There is no room for advancement if you don't have a supervisor or manager that is there to help you be successful.
bad,"N/A - Nothing to add. Cerner is a huge company and they already know what their agenda is.  Hire kids out of college, train them or lay them off if they are not smart enough."
bad,"This was a horrible company.  Lies, lack of leadership, deception, questionable ethics, and the list goes on and on."
bad,They did anything they could to lower costs.  I was hired and then they started a training program 3 months after I started and because they could pay those employees less I was laid off
bad,They hire employee's directly out of college and most of the employee's do not stay more than 1 or 2 years. They do not respect a balance of work and external life outside of Cerner
bad,"Your experience here can change drastically depending on the team you're placed with. The norm for Cerner is typically 40+ hours a week, lower than average pay for the industry, and a preference for new hires over promoting existing associates. Expect to learn archaic, proprietary technologies unless you get lucky and work for a web development team, where even there, your creative ability will be limited. "
bad,"As a disable veteran who was transitioning from active duty, I was fortunate for Cerner to offer me a job early a wait for me to become a civilian. Once I started my new job, I quickly realized that it was a mistake, the culture was cut throat, brown nosers and everyone only did what would benefit them. There was no passion or motivation in anyone that I met. For the first few months, I felt that everyone was intimidated by me because I was not given any work to do when I asked how I could help or what was needed to be worked on. The pay is ridiculous compared to the average in the area but I was willing to give it a chance at first. My years of experience and plethora of technical certifications were never taken seriously and I was always underutilized. Not to mention, I didn't even have my own desk for the first 2 months of working here and I could never get a proper desk chair to help with my spinal injuries. Is this how all disabled veterans are treated. Thanks for wasting my time after my 12 years of serving this country."
bad,"This is a cover your azz environment.  Very little motivation, people working hard to hide in the bureaucracy.   Lot of first job workers with low expectations."
bad,"So long as you drink their cool-aid, you'll succeed here but if you're looking for a job that values individuality and thinking outside the box - this ain't it.  The pay is great but the culture sucks."
bad,"Life as a ""consultant""..."
bad,"Get used to 100 hour weeks, on call for months on end. Especially avoid CernerWrosk."
bad,"I am writing this review to try to keep others from making the same mistake of working here. Cerner’s Montgomery Alabama location is not a good place to work. Especially not as a technician of any sort. The way that management treats the On-site Support Team at this location is borderline horrendous. Management has no qualms whatsoever about openly lying to you. You’ll be surprised at what they’re willing to lie to you about. Policies that don’t exist for any other team at any other location, promotions and raises that will never actually emerge, the opportunity to earn overtime being treated as a luxury good, and so much more awaits you here. "
bad,Cerner will develop you into an associate that can work within Cerner applications but your skills are not necessarily going to transfer to other companies.
bad,You will travel weekly and as a nurse you will not learn build. New management cares about money most! They are laying off and replacing people with lower salaried workers. The management is awful and you only advance if you live in KC.
bad,"This company is solely focused on profit and nothing else. The training is horrible and management in Malvern cannot do anything without the blessing form the corporate office. There is constant micro-managing and back-biting. "
bad,"Typical work day: Go into a meeting for an hour about how we need to use time better so we can meet increasing demands of growing clients while understaffed. 4 hours of client calls and non-production installations, 4 hours of new server build outs and troubleshooting. Drive home, login for east coast maintenance at 6-8, shadow two central production installs 8-10, preform west coast production installs 10-1. Get brought into manager office saying I can't claim more than 10 hours a day. Even though I'm salary and the hours don't matter."
bad,"Management was terrible from the start - it took me weeks to figure out who my actual manager was as they have 12 different managers with different titles and responsibilities."
bad,"Management incompetent. If you suggest improvements, you are treated poorly. There is so much burn out and turnover. Without a doubt, worst job I have ever had."
bad,They'll work you until you're a burned out husk and throw you away. Stay away if you know what's good for you! I don't think I've met a happy customer of theirs yet as Cerner doesn't care about the customers any more than its employees.
bad,"The SSC upper management is very incompetent. Recruitment lies, and they hire people that are unqualified. Then it's expected that you train your manager. "
bad,They are laying off a lot of older workers since they don't want to pay a decent salary.  Hiring young grads at minimal salary.  Expect a lot out of you for little pay and hardly enough time to complete job assignments. Lot of back stabbing by upper management.  Have a death in the family?  No sympathy.  Your career is in jeopardy.
bad,"I was required to work 55 hours per week. I was then asked to work more on the weekends. My PTO decreased from 5 weeks down to 3 weeks when they hired the new CEO, and this was after I had worked there for 5+ years. How a company can take away something that is hard earned after giving them over 5 years of my life is beyond me.I never once received an email telling me thank you or good job in the 5+ years I was there, rather only emails asking for more time, more commitment, more numbers, more work - completely unappreciated. Incredibly stressful environment. No management training is offered, so my manager would communicate changes to us in an email and then say she was too busy to discuss them, which is why she emailed the changes to begin with. Some days, management doesn't even speak to their associates, and then send an email saying they were too busy to engage with us. Very negative, stressful environment - be prepared to only be a number - not a person at Cerner. And not to mention, our entire department has not received a raise in 3 years, and the reason given is that it is an expense year. However we would get an earnings email quarterly that would say how many millions and even billions of dollars had been earned... it is not the company that Neal Patterson broke his back to build. He would be ashamed of what it is today."
bad,Use this place as a steppingstone and take the first good opportunity after you get want you need from them. Don’t trust anything. When you go you will be forgotten the next day. Some departments seem to get along fine but most are over worked.
bad,"Lack of quality Leaders, if any. Management is totally inept and clueless. Cerner is a sweatshop that will work the guts out of you and compensate you like an animal. If you're a conservative and management finds out, you will likely face extra scrutiny and perhaps termination."
bad,"Worst company I've every worked for in my entire 30 plus years of corporate  experience.  Home office in Kansas City displayed no regard for employees located outside of KC.  Lack of dedication to employee training.  The company processes was archaic at best, not willing to accept process.  Far too many manual process to streamline job functions."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to work for. The culture at HQ in KC is so much different than the culture at hospital sites. I worked at an hospital site that had been taken over by Cerner, making most employees bitter towards the company which made for a very poor work environment. Management is about as bad as it gets."
bad,Environment is very stiff. Managers give NO feedback on performance. Pay is just okay..Benefits are Sub-Par for Global Corporation. Workload is insurmountable and unobtainable.
bad,"Cerner Corporation had:"
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. It's possible that it was just the management locally but it was not a fun place to go everyday. I lost over 10K a year when they took over, and had to pay double my healthcare premiums. Not a good way to run a business Cerner."
bad,Very interesting experience and one I would not want to repeat
bad,The building is practically empty. Some sections have been leased out to one of our clients. There is no communication or leadership from the KC main office and most times we are an after thought to planning and discussions. The Soarian solutions are being sun-setted so the future of the building and the teams that support Soarian doesn't look bright.
bad,"Terrible place to work it will drain the energy out of you. It is a dog eat dog world, because there is no team work, training is horrible, and no work/life balance what so ever."
bad,"Very regimented, extremely layered organization.  While I truly enjoy the people I work with, the feeling of ""Big Brother watching"" is always present.  "
bad,"Cerner needs to realize that all employees are not displaced 20 somethings that have no life that love the foosball and pingpong tables and would happily stay at work 24/7.  Management do not know anything outside of the cerner world.  Turnover is close to 30% and there are many reasons for that.  Work there, stay no longer than 2 years and you will be assured of a job."
bad,Cerner Etreby does not follow Cerner mission statement. Cerner corporation is located in Kanas City MO and Etreby is a company bought out by Cerner located in Garden Grove CA. They only uphold Cerners policies when corporate is there to visit. If you are not a family member or friend of upper management at Cerner Etreby than you might as well be cleaning the restroom.  
bad,"Terrible atmosphere. All the focus is on ""close goals"". Have to constantly send out updates on tickets even if it means a bogus email just to stop SLA. Managers will micro-manage your queue and will call you out on everything even if you are busy with another ticket/client. Typically work 10 hours a day and even more on extended hours days to catch up. "
bad,"Cerner is a good place to start your career, but not the best to stay at long term.  Most associates leave after 2 - 5 years of service due to the company demands and the ability to make more money somewhere else with less stress.  There are some advancement opportunities, but only if you live in Kansas City.  The company treats there employees outside of Kansas City and their tenured employees very poorly.  Upper Level and Middle Management are also poor in defining a strategy and executing it.  They change plans constantly, often times not for the better and never with the people they are affecting in mind.  They have decent benefits, but again don't treat their associates very well in the long term.  This is a company to use to get experience and leave before they drive you into the ground."
bad,"I have lost so much respect for this company based on my 2.5 years with them. Management within my department is terrible. No one ever knows the truth about anything, everything is secretive, they make it extremely difficult to move around within the company, they make false promises just to get you to stay with the department, and then lock you in for 18 months. I do not recommend working in the Support organization."
bad,"Worst place to work, work life balance is poor, salary is not  great, lot of corporate politics and bureaucracy, people above you in the hierarchy wouldn't let you to work. Only good time of the day is when you sign-off. Don't join here unless you have no choice"
bad,Management really doesn't care about their employees. When I started my boss did not even know what my job was and did not make it clear what was expected of me. I basically had to find things to do to stay needed since I really did not have many day to day job duties. To make it worse my boss would assign me a task 30 minutes before the end of the work day which needed to be completed that day. So I would have to stay late simply because my boss waited to tell me something needed to get done when I could have been told at the beginning of the day.
bad,Rude and disrespectful to employees who are looking to advance their career or leave the company. Associate relations are a joke and they don't care to help the associates.
bad,"Be aware that if you have a degree and want to pursue a career in a specific area it will not happen at Cerner. Especially if you go through the Velocity Analyst program. Though they tell you that you can have a say in where you are placed, that is false. Everything is based on a business need and you can't do anything about it. They will tell you anything to get you to work there. "
bad,"Cerner is hated among their clients because they make changes to the programs with little warning or with little to no testing. They constantly release updates with known issues that often are not solved for a year or longer. The company seems much more worried about acquiring more clients than maintaining the service of their current clients. "
bad,"sorry to say I cannot recommend Cerner; in the typical way of the software world management now, companies buy other companies for their client base, discard the legacy system and outsource the work to a country overseas.  They did offer a generous buyout and I took it and retired."
bad,"I don't think I've ever met more than three people who have enjoyed working at Cerner. Between the 80%+ travel, very low pay for the industry, minimal training, and negative corporate culture- there is not a lot to recommend about working at Cerner. A good name, but not necessarily a good job."
bad,I am underpaid for the work I do. I have a lack of advancement in my career and advancement is based on education level rather than experience. Health insurance is a lot as well.
bad,No place for professional growth and complete lack of diversity ; no defined goals so most assignments are reactive as opposed to pro-active. Communication is horrible
bad,"In my short time in this position I’ve experienced and seen micromanaging, lay offs, low pay, health ins not great if you go outside of cerner. I would recommend getting hired on only if you have a career goal and use them as a stepping stone. I’ve had the upmost horrible experience with leadership and their gossiping with other employees.The sites that we are contracted with are never satisfied with our work. Training is also so unorganized."
bad,"Cerner Kids had started out with a positive environment but has changed in the last few years. Management wasn't good. It was stressful and teachers weren't  shown respect. We had alot of teachers quit or fired for no reason."
bad,"This place seemed like a great company at the start. But once you stop drinking the coolaid you get to see what they are really about. You have to fight for any promotions, struggle to convince anyone to allow you training and time to train, and management only sees you as a number and little else. Your reviews are loosely based on what you've done but more of how the manager feels about you. The management system is also designed to destroy themselves from the inside, they are all about the next new idea instead of managing and helping those that are in place. It was good for about 6 months and then went down hill from there. Also you will be paid a lot less than what you could doing the same things anywhere else."
bad,Cerner itself seemed to be a nice company with a great vision to drive change in health records and patient outcomes. This unit did not seem to be as motivated for the same goal as Cerner. At least when I was there.
bad,"Often put consultants in front of clients without a clue of what is going on. "
bad,"cerner is a good place to get your feet wet straight out of college, but not a good one to stay at once you've gotten your experience and you can go out into the world and make more"
bad,"Some teams allow you to quickly move within the company while other teams you are stuck in the trenches until you leave. I you are rated below the median line on your yearly review, you cannot move from your team, so you can get stuck on a bad team with no choice but to leave the company."
bad,"The atmosphere was like junior high.  If you didn't fall in with the right group of people you were not liked.  I don't enjoy a childish work environment, there is no room for this in business"
bad,"I found that Cerner's environment was not for me, but it is perfect for a young, single, person right out of college.  Corporate environment was based on who you  know and how hard you partied, Group did not have established processes, training, or performance criteria."
bad,"The company will fill you with all the good perks of working here while in training and then it all changes once you hit the floor. Management is seriously lacking in communication, fairness and not playing favorites. "
bad,Nothing works as it should here. Completely unorganized and no clear direction. Needs lots of improvement with hiring and staffing. Training is lacking greatly.
bad,"Daily learning, problem solving, ""script Kitty"", lack of training to be sufficent for job."
bad,The company does not give much value to their employees or customers.  They will cut any expense to make them look good to wall street.  Will put young inexperienced staff in front of customers in difficult situations and let them fin for themselves without management oversight.
bad,"One of the worst professional experiences in my life.The lack of leadership was baffling. The deficiency of recognition was offensive. The narcissistic attitude that was exuded was unpleasant. There was no mentorship available within my department. There was not a lot of room for ideas to be expressed in regard to improvement. Favoritism was not hidden in any capacity. Overall, it was just a nightmare. I would never recommend for others to spend their time within the company, but you could learn about what not to do while also learning about yourself. I believe that this position assisted with helping me to realize aspects about myself that I wasn't all the way aware of. I know what I will and will NOT deal with."
bad,Doesn’t care about employees. Will push them out of their job. Regional manager doesn’t bother to ask how work flow goes. Makes drastic changes without realizing how it affects patient care.
bad,"Majority there are overworked and new clinics keep getting added on with no additional resources except for clinical staff. Not enough other staff to help overall.  Friends I still know that work there feel disconnected, dismissed and not appreciated at all!"
bad,"Cerners model is not one to establish confidence with the client base.  80% college grads with unearned credentials in Revenue Cycle.   less than 20% experienced credentialed professionals.   This model will never support driving increased confidence with clients to implement Revenue Cycle solutions. "
bad,"Not compensated for experience. Expectation is that you work overtime wo compensation. Expectation is that at a go live, you work as much as the company tells you to."
bad,"This was the most poorly managed, most unorganized, dysfunctional sweatshop I've ever experienced.  Senior management would fudge numbers to make our division look better than it actually was."
bad,One of my first jobs out of college. It gave me opportunity but no growth. I ended up going back to college to advance my career. It gave me the necessary skills I needed.
bad,Not to many positives here I'm sorry.They worked their people to death with little pay.
bad,"They placed me in a position different than my contract once I started citing ""business need."""
bad,"If you are looking for a job out of college this is it, it's faced paced and you can learn a lot in your first year or two. Past that, it would be better to look elsewhere, as the compensation and work life quickly falls way behind similar competitors in the same healthcare IT space."
bad,"Expect to work well over 40hrs a week as a salary exempt employee. Cerner has a reputation for not investing in the success or growth of their employees and that is 100% correct."
bad,"Your experience depends on the team that your are placed on and what team you are placed on is more like the roll of the dice. There is no control on that for new employees coming in and there is no control on if you even stay on that team. I was unfortunate to get the low end of the stick and was place on a team that was by far the best place to work. A typical day was very stressful for everyone. The policies that we were supposed to follow were unclear. There was a lack of communication between support, the team I was on, and Development and consulting. The team went through a change in managers and team lead which made things even worse as the team lead didn't have any type of leadership experience and she didn't have a clue of what we TSA's did on a regular bases. We gave her explanations and on what we did and what could improve the team management would ignore and implement other structures that would make things worse and blame the TSA's for it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management as they were distant from the people they were suppose to manage. They made false promises and they caused multiple people to leave. There wasn't an enjoyable part of the job that I can list."
bad,Poor management nobody cares about you. No lunch breaks and mandatory overtime. Work environment is messy and rude. Management does not care and will not fix it. A lot of disgruntled employees.
bad,"I would not recommend working here if you like work life balance, transparency, respect and growth. The mission and vision is all talk and no action. located in Kansas City Missouri. Company is thinning out and getting ready to sell."
bad,"Management was dysfunctional."
bad,"The company culture is shallow and not conducive to learning. They just have a very yuppie, workaholic culture that does not appreciate individuality."
bad,"HR controls the company, so management is left saying one thing and being held to another set of expectations provided by HR. If you're in Consulting, travel is highly required and expected to be able to advance."
bad,"Work here for a year or two, then move to a real company with a good benefits package, mature/skilled management, thorough training, a clear outline for future advancement, and a review process that makes sense."
bad,"The day begins with meetings pertaining to client projects, clients roadmapping sessions, eslcations with service requests logged, working with infrastructure on networking setup, team meetings, client calls with internal Executives around sales contracts coming up and hardware constraints. The most enjoyable part is working with the clients and helping through thier vision as an organization."
bad,"Company/location atmosphere is negative and disheartened.  A lot of change and tenured employees leaving.  Newer employees are paid far less than employees that were hired by company acquired by Cerner 2 years ago, though in higher positions."
bad,"Cerner is one of the leaders in the health care information technology industry and has developed a number of innovations related to data capture and electronic medical records. It is a good place to start a career, but not a place to be long term. I enjoyed learning new technologies and the software development process. The challenge I had was grasping all the new technologies within a short period of time, but despite the challenge, I still enjoyed my job. However, having incompetent managers who lacked management and interpersonal skills, and the consistent ambiguity did not make my job fun any more."
bad,"This is a good first job for college kids just starting out. You'll gain lots of useful experience. Just be prepared to work some long hours. If you're a hard charger, you can move up the ladder fast. However, my advice is to work here for 2-3 years, get your feet wet, and then let your experience with Cerner catapult you to a better job. That's what I did. As mentioned previously, working here means no work/life balance (60+ hours are common), most employees are underpaid and employee performance reviews are done using the bell curve."
bad,"Work is not difficult as long as you push aside the customers needs and close all calls asap! The cerner etreby family is hard to work with especially if you do not speak their language! Employees gather into groups like a ""gang"" and you will be ""put out"" if you do not follow the devil crew! No one will admit it due a basic pharm. Tech salary starting at $22/hr (only perk!) Management philosophy ""one will lie and the other will swear to it!"" Hardest part of the job is trust and team work! Great place to start work if you can handle all the gossip. Do not trust anyone, learn fast what you can and then get out asap!"
bad,"Leadership is incentivized by how much revenue their org generates or how many people are in their organization.  So much of the culture resides around what is in it for me not what is best for the corporation.  Everyone is busy doing a whole lot of busy work, talking about work, planning, reorganizing the work but very little gets done.  Our clients are cordial to us but none of them are strong advocates of our software or our services.  Upper leadership two to three levels up recognize your face but don't spend any time getting to know you or showing that they really care.  They also manage their reputation and mange up not down.  They attend a ton of meetings and hardly anything gets communicated down to us contributors."
bad,"If you thrive in an environment where everyone thinks the same way, this is your ideal job. Millennials are happy to have jobs and don't mind being treated like robots."
bad,"After 5 months my manager gave me ""the talk"" which was that we were expected to put in 48 hours a week minimum. The general culture here is that you put in the most hours you possibly can, and if you're getting all of your work done in less than 48 hours/week, then you need more work."
bad,The expected a lot of me but hardly required others to do the same. I was required to work on all tasks throughout the day and still doubled phone calls of those who were only working on the phones.
bad,"Very stressful environment.  Very young management, which is alot of the reason for the stressful environment.  Sink or swim environment.  Benefits are not what you would expect for the size company."
bad,"I had the worst boss in my 30 yr career. Our Director liked to preach how Cerner was a career not just a job but in the 3 yrs I was there, nobody from our team was ever promoted even though there were openings. In fact they went to the street 3 times while I was there to fill a promote-able job . My last manager turned out to be a tyrant. I quit the management more than the job. Leaving was easy."
bad,"Cerner is great in the sense you have job security however it lacks everything else. Management as not actively engaged in day to day of the company. Constant resourcing shortages i.e. not enough team members to work across all projects. "
bad,Cerner is great for someone starting in IT.  Compensation/benefts don't attract seasoned IT personnel.  Benefits are average.
bad,"Almost always hectic life, if one is workaholic, he will find him self behind the computer 24/7. if one will try to stick to the working hours, he wouldn't be appreciated and they will be after him"
bad,"Lots of IT problems. If you have an issue accessing something necessary for your job, don't expect HR or IT to get it resolved in a timely manner. From day 1 until the day we left, I never had issues resolved."
bad,"Company was ran much better a few years ago before original CEO passed away. New way of management is all profit driven and you are a number to make that happen. Good start if your out of college, if you want to work 80 hrs a week and be paid salary at 40 hrs."
bad,"Very demanding work environment with constant change. Work/life balance is a struggle due to frequent pressure to work more with fewer associates. High turnover rate, lower than market pay."
bad,Company struggles with enterprise wide objectives. Many of the managers fail to appropriately handle situations with individuals that have disabilities.
bad,"Many of the engineers that work for this company use it as a launch pad to go somewhere else.  Cerner knows this and acts accordingly.  Prepare to work more than 40 hours on some teams within this company.  Great place to start a career, if you are young and newly graduated."
bad,"Cerner was a great experience, but it was a real meat grind of a work environment. The had a very high turn over in personnel and did not do a very good job of taking care of their employees."
bad,"The supervisor is no where to be found. On my fisrt day of work she didn't show up to onboard me, I called her and she told me she ""totally forgot"". I knew from day one it was unorganized. My training days were a complete waste of time, useless in fact. No one was training me, the co workers were rude and didn't want to help me. I spent many shifts lost and only met with frustration by my coworkers. Whose running this place? It's chaos. The employees that have been there for 2 years + seem to think they run the place. Very disappointed. This job is awful"
bad,"I honestly feel like the company was not honest with me when they merged with Adventist Health.  They advised if I didn't have my CPC by a certain date, they will try and relocate me to another position with them or I can reapply with Adventist Health.  Well I took my CPC exam twice and didn't pass and when the time came they didn't help me find another position through the company.  I feel like they didn't keep their word."
bad,"Large company with multiple divisions who all work independently of one another--corporate America. Gorgeous offices and facilities, not enough focus on work/life balance for entry level employees"
bad,"If you're not a software engineer, they do not care much for you. Consulting has a new open office environment which is terrible for productivity as well as well-being. You are given table space which is about 3 feet wide and can hearing everything your neighbors are doing. Since consultants are on the phone for 3-4 hours a day, you spend most of your day listening to other peoples conversations hating your life. If you intend to take your laptop to the cafeteria or another work space, your manager will tell you to come back to your desk so that you can be unproductive and hear everyone's phone conversation."
bad,"The support IT life at Cerner is a hit or miss. It really depends on what team you're placed at in the beginning. Fortunately, my team was pretty cool."
bad,"If you are looking for a company to start your IT career, Cerner is it.  However, they treat those over 30 very poorly and pay is capped well below industry standard.  Management is weak and does not have a ton of experience or business acumen.  They don't respect you and god forbid if you have a different way of doing something. And if you work outside the KC main offices, they avoid you like the plaque."
bad,"This was a really stressful company. I was lured in with promises of a fun culture in working with challenging technology. The technology was fine but the people and culture were all out of whack. There are great opportunities to gain experience. But, the experience is mostly Cerner proprietary content related. If you have experience in IT where everything is standard in some way this may not be for you as the position you could get with Cerner experience is usually Cerner related."
bad,"In the past I was encouraged to improve the clients experience, and now it seems to be only about numbers.  Management says they care, but they have proved many times that it is only important to follow process and make the numbers look good.  if the client suffers that is not an issue, even though they say it is.  I have seen clients miss-treated and they sweep it under the rug.  I have always tried to do whatever it took to make a good experience for the client and correct their problems, but now it is just about closing tickets, fixed or not.  The bureaucracy is out of control and no longer tolerable in some departments.  "
bad,"If you like high intensity competition with so called ""teammates,"" zero job coaching, and being set up to FAIL then this is the company for you. The organization seems wasteful, not interested in employee feedback, outdated and yet their very existence thrives on advancing in technology. They are stuck in the patriarchal rat-race and are in desperate need of a paradigm shift to stay relevant, in my opinion. I would NEVER recommend this company to a friend or family member, I would be embarrassed if they treated someone I knew personally the way I was treated. Maybe in Kansas City, MO this company is respected (because it employs half the city) but they are your typical CORPORATE MACHINE with little respect for the people at the bottom doing the difficult work!"
bad,"Long, long work days and management asks for more"
bad,"Worst Management and not good for experienced people. Even it is a product company, but the culture is like a service company and they not even care about the employees."
bad,"Good place to work for freshers , too much focused on management. Need to upgrade to the latest technology. Can be improved in managing the people. Too much of self driving initiative by managers"
bad,A good place to work especially for the fresher candidates. Though the work culture varies depending upon the teams but overall it's feasible.
bad,"Be very careful about getting a job here and ask a lot of questions about what team you will be on."
bad,"your career at cerner will be defined by the leadership. If they are bad you will feel it. if it is good, you will feel it. seems very inconsistent and varied."
bad,"Management can level-up by a notch."
bad,One of the leader have lots of ego and religion and castisum politics and unable to understand leaders quality no job security poor people management and lots of harrassment to female employees and favoritism to particular state of india
bad,"Most projects in healthcare take too long to provide immediate benefit, leaving most of the technology to be half through it's lifecycle before it's adopted.  And then required to be maintained decades after it's been sunset.  Creating a perpetual cycle of maintaining old solutions for too long, and causing bad experiences for clinicians."
bad,the C in Cerner is for Change....daily change. Its hard to keep up with the daily changes and there is no structure. I work for the 3rd party company RevWorks and its a never ending battle to keep up with the changes. IF there was a working structure at hand then it wouldnt be an issue in getting the work done.
bad,"I joined this company right out of school. After a year I realized this is a company you retire at and nothing more. I do not see a future with Cerner, as my recent raise only verified. The management is pretty decent with very nice people. However, the lack of professionalism or defined culture make this feel like a day-to-day job, and not a career."
bad,"Probably one of the worst jobs I've ever had. I was paid well but but I wish I would have never accepted their offer. Cerner, IMO, is the McDonald's of the IT world. Turnover is constant. They are constantly reorganizing this creates constant turmoil. Trying to manage a constant influx of new employees who really don't know about the software. "
bad,I was a travel consultant - when I was not traveling I wasn't getting paid and I was not traveling to continue with getting paid. I was needing to move forward.
bad,"Cerner isn't all that they make themselves out to be. Look beyond the hype! High turnover says a lot about the company and culture. There's a lack of integrity among executives. However, there are some great people who stay and seek to make a positive impact."
bad,"There are a lot of opportunities to advance at Cerner. However, the pay is still well below industry standards. A perfect company to get your feet wet out of college, but not a great place to make your lifetime career."
bad,"In my time with Cerner I went from a team where we worked well over 8 hours a day, five days a week, as well as time on the weekend, to a team where I had nothing to do 8 hours a day, five days a week. Despite not having any tasks to complete, Cerner would not allow me to move to another team so that I could be productive within the company. "
bad,You will be overworked here. They will keep adding more work to your plate until you quit or transfer from your position.
bad,"Hires young, inexperienced new college grads and place them in exempt positions to work long hours for the opportunity to begin their careers."
bad,"Cerner is a company that is good for new graduates. "
bad,Boss is understanding about work and life. Co-workers are good as well. Some folks can move up in the corporate environment quicker than others.
bad,The management is horrible and the clinic show favoritism.  The clinic is ran by safety and they want you to do unacceptable things to keep down recordablity.  That place is a joke.
bad,"The work we do is rewarding and challenging at times. It feels good when you can make a difference. But more often than not your team will work on something that gets scrapped or not utilized for its original purpose. "
bad,When i first started working for Cerner it was an awesome place.  After being reorganized multiple times and being a virtual associate in a Kansas City Centric organization my career was stiffled.  The support organization  is not a good organization to work for.  Issue mostly around the middle managers.
bad,"Good place to learn for young engineers, fun place to be, not pay masters, work life balance depends on which project you go to."
bad,"Cerner is a good company but has too many young people and hires too many young people.  The result is the experienced applicants do not get paid what they deserve because Cerner can hire a warm body to fill the spot and pay them little.   The generations are lacking in being able to communicate with each other.  When you say good morning to others they usually do not respond, don't look up from their phone or look up and not know how to respond.  Sadly this environment runs into the customer and Cerner likes to put their young employees on teams that communicate with clients even if they do not have experience in what they have to discuss with the client.  Sad!  Inexperience teaching physicians and professionals, young employees in charge of customer relationships and just graduated from college...."
bad,It was a good starting company outside of college that provided opportunities for recent grads however the progression is weak and the training is poor outside of KC.
bad,"I've been at Cerner just under two years, starting in a Consulting Analyst role within Revenue Cycle and moving to Associate Consultant after a consulting wide reorganization (no change in day to day, just a name change). "
bad,"Just another company to work for.  Your experience at the company depends on what team you work for and who your boss is.  Some teams have an great manager who engages in employee development, while others just have a boss."
bad,"Working for Cerner was pretty good but working for Cerner Security was horrible.  Security has a astronomical turn over rate.  Mandatory overtime based on staffing shortages was almost daily and would come with no or little notice.  All training is done on your time because of the staffing shortages, meaning you are expected to work your shift and then attend training or train all day and then work your shift or train on your day off.  The pay was OK and benefits were sub par.  99% of your job is doing mundane, busy work such as walking buildings several times a shift, writing down laptops that were left out and counting cars parked in the lot, yes I'm being serious.  If you are desperate for a job go ahead I guess but there is better out there."
bad,"I did not like Cerner. "
bad,"Good product range and customization of products to fit customer needs. Poor corporate support in terms of salaries, chronic under staffing and expectations of employee overtime for free."
bad,"I have worked in a couple different roles and training is a huge miss. The ""working instructions"" are made by the previous associate and most of the time are very confusing to follow. The expectations are they will show a couple of times and want you to run with project from there. This makes it difficult to build confidence in the work. Team atmosphere, far from it. You are part of a team of 3 to 6 associates but the teams have little overlap in duties. The best way to discribe the team is like in baseball everybody cares about their individual performance but lacks the overall team record part to create unity."
bad,"If you are a ""company man"" looking for a place to spend your whole career this could be the place for you.  The company is a leader in an ever growing space and they seem to always be launching new initiatives around the globe.  If you come in and work hard you should enjoy a stable, long term career. "
bad,"There is a lot of cultural changes discussed but it'll take time to see if the organization can make the shift."
bad,"Cerner is known around the area as a good place to work. That has not really been my experience. New to Cerner associates are treated in a sink or swim fashion with little help from management. So if you are sinking you don't know who to reach out to. "
bad,"Cerner required overtime (without additional compensation), and frowned upon lunch breaks or using PTO. The staff was friendly, and the benefits we're great if you saw onsite physicians, but not if you wanted care off-site. "
bad,"Cerner has a great reputation and benefits, and the pay is good for the Kansas City market, but be prepared to drink the Kool Aid, cause what they offer isn't free. The amount of information that they expect you to know is ridiculous, then throw you on the phones with little or no support. It's stressful. It's impossible to handle all the information necessary to perform your job successfully, and the culture is for 20 somethings ... there isn't much room for people over 40 unless you've been there forever and aged into the job. Lots of Bros and Cheerleaders and Basics. If you like to follow the leader and drink from the hose, this is the place for you. Otherwise, be prepared to hate your job every day."
bad,"Cerner's product is very effective.  However, I realized I had made a mistake in joining this company after my first week of orientation.  There was almost a ""caste"" system, with new associates being the lowest level.  It was not a pleasant place to work - I hope it has changed since I left."
bad,"Lots of great opportunities with exciting technologies. Pretty casual environment and many onsite amenities including gym, pool, basketball and racquetball courts and cafes. Many green initiatives and philanthropic efforts to support communities and individuals with health care needs. Collaborative work environment and good people."
bad,"Working for Cerner started off on a bad note because the job described to me was not the job I was given.  I was given a System Engineer title with expectations of both support work and project work.  The position was 100% help desk with not a single project in the year I worked there.  I was unfortunately put under the supervision of an inexperienced, lazy, and disrespectful ""Team Lead"".  On multiple occasions he put down his team members and/or quickly became agitated with their questions.  He would also get very angry whenever you didn't do what he said.  Which resulted in him yelling at his team like they were children stating that ""you need to do what I say because I am in charge"".  This happened to me at least once while on the phone with a client.  He slept on the job which was widely known but nothing was done about it.  I worked with one of the many teams on Cerner's helpdesk.  I witnessed several team members who were denied advancement or transfer to another team they were qualified for based on political reasons.   A typical day consisted of answering phone calls and responding to issues ranging from power/connectivity issues to complex outages or system configuration errors.  Other teams and co-workers frequently had a ""who can I dump this work on attitude"" although there were some great people I worked with.  Hardest part of the job was trying to deal with inconsistent expectations. I described the 3 team leads on my team by saying ""you will get 5 answers to the same question"".  Frustration came quickly when direct team members would send work to other teams without"
bad,"I was so excited to work for cerner and I finally got on and it was nothing that I thought it would be! First, the training is mediocre and they throw you out there .My direct supervisor was never around and she NEVER answered any of my emails. Also, you are required to take an hour lunch and you get NO BREAKS! How can you keep people motivated when they are forced to sit at their desks all day long?! It is so quite and so serious everyday. People aren't too friendly, they have their little clicks ans stay to themselves. It is also FREEZING in the building off North Oak... EVERYDAY! Miserable! Also, if you are looking for a challenge and you are a medical biller, this is not the place for you... You don't""work"" the claims... You are basically the middle mad between the client and cerner. I am happy I am no longer with the company! I am very disappointed at my cerner opprotunity."
bad,"My mom always told me: ""If you don't have anything nice to say then don't anything at all."" I will have to apply her wisdom in this particular situation."
bad,Cerner is a great company with a great mission. With so many projects its easy for poor management to slip in sometimes. The project i was on was very tedious and work was needed and then it wasn't needed.
bad,"Cerner is a great starting ground for the high amount of students they hire fresh out of college due to their application being used nation-wide. However, pay is extremely low and the travel can be grueling. It takes 18 months to change roles but that does not guarantee any compensation increase. Its worthwhile to put a year or two in, but I expect their turnover after two years is very high"
bad,Cerner provides a very challenging environment to springboard into the industry.
bad,A typical day at work in the RevWorks department varies from day to day. You must be flexible. I learned mostly on the job through my peers not through formal training. Management has very high expectations that seems very unrealistic as a biller seeing the day to day problems. The hardest part of my job is seeming that management doesn't hear what the billers see as issues on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I find a trend and can report the trend through a service request and it then becomes a resolved issue.
bad,"Management is good, workplace and culture is satisfying. Campus is beautiful but salary is low as compared to engineers in other company. You will learn new technology as they are working on lots of new things."
bad,Cerner is a good company that gave me an opportunity to further my career. I provided support/build for INVISION/OAS Gold Patient Management solution as well as Ad-Hoc Reporting.
bad,"Great place to work depending on who you work under. Very flexible schedule. Amazing benefits. Great hours, depending what you do. You will do great if you are able to thrive in a very micro-managed environment. Prepare to be a robot."
bad,"First job out of college. Lots of time and money spent in new hires, but my passion lies elsewhere. They could make the work life balance better so you can have a life outside of the job in my opinion. They are also in severe need in experienced management. Plain and simple."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Im not a sit at a desk all type worker and the position as analyst was all sitting. I wasn't clearly informed on how much sitting i'll be doing. They are a great company, just not for me."
bad,"I always find the opportunity to meet first thing with my staff to engage and round, to ensure they have all the necessary equipment to perform their work."
bad,What can i say. IT was a blast working there and the people were really nice and i learned a great deal and i had fun traveling and i liked the meetings
bad,"I have always dreamed of working at Cerner, until I started working here.  Empty promises."
bad,I no longer work for Cerner as of 11/4/19. Cerner sold our portion of the business to Adventist Health in California. I have nothing else to say about it.
good,"They tell you that there are so many opportunities available to you, when in fact there are not unless you want to relocate to KC.  A extremely clicky form of management.  Major favoritism and major inconsistency with team leads and management."
good,Management nit flexible.  Department was a revolving door.  Management did nothing to retain excellent employees.  Raises were earned and promised but not given.
good,Not for experienced professionals. This is a great job for folks just graduating from college looking to get health information technology experience. Much of the hiring is based on nepotism so try to find a relative that works there. Women are generally paid less than men.
good,"If you get moved into management at their request, don't expect to be compensated!  They will work you to death and not compensate you in any way.  They will not promote you and they will not provide any value to moving up.  If you encounter a major issue, you are stuck for 18 months in the position and cannot move no matter what you do."
good,"They run their people into the ground and it is highly competitive.  If you have a thick skin, an open mind and can work independently the sky is the limit for the amount you will learn through direct experience.  I wouldn't be where I am today without Cerner but it was not a very healthy culture to work in."
good,"Be prepared to work 40+ hrs a week while receiving a salary below national average. Travel on weekends for clients, little to no personal time.  Health insurance is good. They do very little to show appreciation for their employees and all the sacrifices they make. Remote positions are very limited, do not let the recruiter tell you the position has the opportunity to be ""remote"", they do not."
good,I really did not like that job I am trying to find me something better for me stick to the job and make everything complete I'm trying to find me a job that I like has benefits
good,They want you to work long hours. Training is horrible. Micro managed every day. Metrics they use are not logical at all. Nine hour days at a minimum are expected and they want more. Nothing is ever good enough.
good,"As a Clinical Strategist, I was offered lots of training at Cerner Corporation.  Sometimes there is role unclarity and you don't know if you are expected to be an architect or a strategist.  The company pays well but you have to pay outstanding balances on your Diners card.  You are expected to work evenings and weekends on some client sites."
good,The manager I had would never help due to they were too busy with their own work to help out when you needed them. It was nose to the grind and if you took a break it was not allowed.
good,"This is a good place for those adept in the corporate world.  There is no individuality allowed.  No job security, you may be on one team one week, another the next week, and another the week after that."
good,"Cerner makes up for poor pay with flexible work hours and remote requests if you can get it approved."
good,"Its was an okay place to work for, they like to lock you into a job 18 months at a time. They are not very transparent. They will make false promises. Other than that it's just a job."
good,"For new collage grads looking for a technical role this is great experience for your first 1-2 years to pad your resume; but plan to move on to a different company after to get paid your value. Your experience really depends on your team placement, but expect to be stagnant in your position/pay if you decide to stay more than 1-3 years. You will be under paid for the work you do comparatively to other company's long term."
good,"Overall, Cerner can provide good opportunities for those who seek it. But beware, for those who work hard this becomes a timeless pit of dispair. Cerner sucks the life out of you if you let it, so make sure you know how to say NO and the culture can at times be toxic depending on the team and management you have."
good,You could not take breaks through out the day. When you asked for assistance it was not right away because they were too busy to help you. No one took ownership of their work.
good,"Was a good starting job to get some experience. Don't know how people make careers out of that place. If you are looking for a place that values employees, instead of arbitrary metrics, I'd look elsewhere."
good,You gain great experience at Cerner and the work we do affect patient lives positively. There is little opportunity for growth in the company and the pay is not good
good,I helped multiple clients understand the Cerner Practice Manager by creating processes and sharing knowledge with clients.  Client billing includes all areas of medical billing.
good,They worked you long hours for little pay and didn't value your hard work but expected you to continue to brake your back for no acknowledgement. Its not as easy as they make it seem to move up in the company and if you do they call it a lateral move and give you a new new title with no more pay.
good,Fantastic Place to work until Cerner bought over Siemens. Cerner does not provide any work life balance and management tells staff that they need to figure it out.
good,"They care more about how many hours you put in instead of whether or not the job actually gets done.The Upgrade Center management in Malvern does not encourage, or tolerate, out of the box thinking"
good,My role is very challenging and rewarding.  The biggest reward is helping people improve their health and well-being every single day.     There are pros and cons to every job.
good,Job culture was amazing only if the management followed it the environment would be amazing. I loved the opened schedule and optional lunch was awesome. I didn't like how the job came before your family and personal life when agreeing to work for this company you are agreeing to place your career above your family & social life which as a mother that was extremely hard
good,"I gained a lot of experience there but the work/life balance needs improved, I think the employees would be a lot more motivated if that issue was taken care of."
good,Easy Hire easy fire. And when you land up a project there is not much to learn. Management is also not transparent. No new innovation.
good,Work several hours which equates to low pay. Management is very selling serving. They will walk all over you to get ahead or protect their lack of leadership.
good,"American ops are great; in Canada - is complete opposite. micro management and semi retired staff unwilling to work with new employees. Wont recommend unless you are willing to move to Kansas City, MO."
good,Training provided is very less.  Job expectations are high.  Reporting structure within Consulting is very different - which inhibits the growth.  Lot of favoritism.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job/work life in Cerner is the KC counter part. They are very informative and transparent about the work which is coming in. Even they have very good approach and technical team to lead the IT to cater the market needs."
good,"It's Corporate..is there anything else to say?"
good,The company's culture is largely comprised of a white demographic. Anyone with a cultured or disabled demographic are obviously treated differently and held up to higher/different standards than the majority.
good,Compensation and benefits are good. Talented employees. Long hours (50 or more / week). Leadership is lacking and better organizational structure is needed.
good,"Managers who don't know how to do your job making decisions about your productivity, marketing products and services that can not be delivered in a reasonable time or manner."
good,"Learned about resolving basic technical issues of the product.  Worked with users from medical facilities, providing normal services, and answering technical questions."
good,This is a good starter company with tons of travel and has a young leadership core.  With that being said if you have a young mindset it is wonderful place.
good,"Not great from my perspective, it is hard to gain the work life balance if you do not have a family.  Upset with current management style, but could be improved."
good,"Poor work life balance."
good,Cerner is a complex organization with unique values and demands.  I am seeking a better quality of life and an actual work/life balance.
good,Cerner is a cold place to work. People aren't friendly. Cerner's management staff is only concerned about meeting the production number; not it's employees.
good,"Its a nice place for freshers and not for people who have vision and are very fluent with their work. Its a place filled with lot of politics and we had to transform into another human being, because of which we decided to stay away from Bangalore office."
good,Fun and exciting environment for someone wanting to see the country.
good,"Great staring company for people straight out of college; However, as you stay longer at the company, you realize that you plateau and work seems redundant."
good,A good company to work for with great opportunity to enhance existing skills and develop new ones. Much collaboration between associates who are very good and respecting and including others.
good,"I've only been with Cerner for a few weeks, so can't really review, and now I'm being transferred to Adventist Health. What little I have experience with Cerner I liked."
good,It was an okay experience and it isn't a bad place to start fresh out of college.  Didn't provide much training and had the unfortunate experience of being left with a mentor that had little experience himself and not very helpful in learning the solution.
good,"Cerner tends to hire young people right out of college, work them 60 hours a week, and they quit or leave within two years of hiring in travel positions. Consulting and resourcing are punishing, and everything is KC-based, despite having a full office of 1,000+ employees in Malvern."
good,"My typical workday was 8 hours due to being non-exempt. They do not want any overtime, however if the position is exempt, expect to work over 40 hours in a week."
good,I enjoyed by tenure at Resource Systems however when Cerner purchased the company I did not care for the way the company handled their processes.  I did not like the large size the company became.
good,"Technical Meetings with project teams"
good,"They overhire entry-level employees, so they is high turnover. There was not enough work on my team to keep everyone busy, but you were expected to work 6 hours of overtime minimum."
good,As a former advocate of Cerner Corp. and dedicated to their mission  (as well as employee and stockholder) I must say Cerner Corp pays very well and has the potential to be an excellent workplace for most employees. The company seems however to levitate to a specific youthful employee profile.
good,Company doesn't care about employees well-being while doing their job only about the fact the job is done at any cost. Management was not sympathetic and training as a new hire was lacking.
good,"Company lacks the proper structure to stay disciplined and focused. There are multiple areas of overlap, and there is limited accountability at the executive level."
good,"My experience started out pleasant, but as of late, my work ethics vary drastically from the current leadership. I would like more transparency and support from the leadership."
good,work and facility are nice but management is not at all supportive. management does not care about the develeopment of employee and does not provide any support. no hike. only manager's relative are hired.
good,"Have lot of resources to gain knowledge about the product.   "
good,Good for freshers. Job security is plus. Average time of an associate in the company is 3 years. Company invests lot of time and money in training freshers.
good,Not making enough money to pay my bills but my coworker who does the same work or less is making twice my pay. Not enough advancement. The training is horrible.
good,I have not been there that long but I hope that there is room for advancement but I doubt if I can wait 18 months to put in a transfer to work in an area that I am already qualified for.  My degrees are very specific and I was only offered an entry level position when I should have received an offer for the other applications I placed as well.  My recruiter was not the greatest and still did not respond to a email that I sent to her asking why I was not considered for a higher position given my education and experience.
good,"It’s very clicky there , if you aren’t in good with someone you do not get promoted . Their promotions are a joke , if you get a title change you do not get the pay until 18 months later . You have to stay in that role for 18 months before they will review your pay . You take on more responsibility and duties for the same pay. They hire right out of college which is great until they give them a manager role with no experience and you are having to train them on how to be a manager or write professional emails.  In some cases it is a great company like giving you a chance to go on site and learn how their software works in real time . They do have meetings and ask for your opinions. It just seems like you are a number there and you can be replaced at anytime . Feels like what you do doesn’t matter ."
good,I was told that certain options was giving to my position and once in the door those options was not given. I feel that the recruiters mislead you to get more recruites.
good,Not many opportunities for advancement. If you want to have a career then look somewhere else. Promotions are usually blocked because they don't want talent to leave.
good,"Office culture is laidback and great. Get your work done, and youre fine. Keep an eye on management though. It's hit or miss. If you get a solid manager, expect a nice career path. If you don't, evaluate yourself and your options. "
good,"Cerner is... An interesting place."
good,This is a good company to start developing a career at.  I would not recommend being determined to stay at this company for more than 2 or 3 years.  They are very slow for career development and are repeatedly told that you cannot apply out for positions because they need to keep you in your current position.
good,"This is a good place to start your career. "
good,"Extreme timelines, stressful work environment, will have several clients assigned to a single person. "
good,"Pros:"
good,"A typical day of work included about 3 - 5 hours of meetings almost daily then an hour or so reading and responding to e-mails. If you are lucky you might actually get about 4 hours of actual coding done during the day with constant interruptions. Most managers are very good at trying to keep the engineers focused on their job responsibilities, where others will not run any interference with the noise and will happily throw you under the bus. I enjoyed working there as I usually had the best management, with exception of my last one which is why I resigned as my problems were not addressed in the least. The culture used to be great. We used to have events either on campus or off almost every other month to help release the pressure. Over the last several years that fell away completely and the job just became an engineers nightmare of a constant grind."
good,"This is a great place to work for fresh graduates. The company as a whole is highly geared to retain management, but not engineering/architectural staff. Turnover is very high. "
good,"Cerner is a great place to start, but growth opportunities are limited and can be difficult to get. Build your network, learn from others, then find a place to take the next step."
good,"It is true that Cerner is one of the largest and most successful employers in the KC community. A position inside is a coveted thing and Cerner does make good on its monetary offerings. But however well you may be compensated, you cannot buy time. Within Cerner, a popular saying is: ""there's no life but the Cerner life."" If you have little to no aspirations of pursuing outside interests or having a family, and if you don't mind the occasional 7-day stretch of a work-week - then you will enjoy working here and making good money in the process."
good,Like most jobs it depends on what team or people you may end up to if they transfer you to another department - not ask - just transfer you - over all great - new team was not focused on anything but India education
good,"Cerner is proud to have a young workforce with little experience, high turnover and low pay compared to other I.T. Companies.  Management is primarily associates who have grown within the company.  So there is very little experience outside of the Cerner culture which is dysfunctional at best.  Resources are strained.  Clients are continually fighting for seasoned resources and Cerner Mgmt is not agile enough or equipped to react quickly and appropriately."
good,"At Cerner there is not a typical day, many times you will have your day planned out and have to adjust due to additional needs and or requirements that pop up.  That is part of what I enjoyed about my job at Cerner.  I also enjoyed working directly with clients and having an impact on their ability to meet organizational goals and regulatory requirements."
good,There was no Job Work/Life Balance at Cerner and we were expected to work 50+ hours a week often working on weekend was required.
good,I have been working at Best Companies full-time for more than 5 years but this is the company where I have learnt alot and alwayd pulled my socks up for the given targets. Love to work and prove myself as a best worker and I believe I am a true asset to a company.
good,Company needs to concentrate on metrics and ability to deliver resources and complete projects on schedule.   Systems that run the company from both and operations and sales needs to be improved.  Sales Force could definitely help improve customer satisfaction.
good,Working for Cerner is challenging and rewarding. There are opportunities to learn and they promote innovation and collaboration. The work that is done at Cerner is meaningful.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Cerner is a large corporation, and you certainly feel it as an associate. There are some great perks and benefits, but it's also difficult to make much of an impact or be heard. The turnover rate is very high, and you often can't really get to know many people before they're gone. "
good,You and managers get transferred around constantly with not much notice or none at all.  This company has a high turn over rate. Wouldn't recommend it
good,Cerner plays favorites.  There is no such thing as work hours and often you work early morning and late evenings.  Feels more like a high school then a workplace.
good,"I've work for them over a year just looking for growth."
good,"-A lot of flexibility to work from home "
good,"Consulting work starts with Different regions of support and timings vary accordingly"
good,Progress at work based more on rapport building with superiors than actual performance at work.HR managers are very powerful and manipulative.Job security and progress depends more on the evaluation of HR managers rather than engineering managers.Lot of senior professionals observed to quit and move to other companies in a short span of time.
good,"Generally speaking it is fine, but it really depends on what side of the business you are on and then what team you are on. There for many years before I had to leave. Many of those years were good, but the last couple were too much and it was time to go."
good,"The work culture is shifting and I am not sure it is for the better.  Seems to be lots of job dissatisfaction for those that are actually honest and not drinking the lemonade.  Typical work week is a minimum 48+ hours and (unwritten) expectations that you log into your device at night and during your time off.  Very heads down in some organizations.  The pluses are that there is an onsite cafe at most offices, along with free exercise facilities (if you have free time) and some office locations have on-site physicians and psychologists.  good benefits but compensation varies.  "
good,Thanks for giving opportunities to write few words about Cerner experience. Company was full of Indian mentality leaders where they want to growth to higher position hence they started asking more working hours for few teams and I was part of operational team in India and our leader used to be good but his subordinates are very aggressively want to grow to higher level tat sake they are giving more pressures to employees.
good,"cerner itself is usually a good place to work, however I feel their expectations of their teachers are way higher than the way they treat their teachers. I feel like they could and should pay their teachers better and management needs to treat their employees like they matter. There is a reason their turn over rate is so incredibly high."
good,"Competetive Salary coming out of college, but it quickly becomes evident why their retention rates are low. You don't get the resources you need to produce the results they expect."
good,Management in the CTS organization was poor and did not take into account all the good work one did.  Only the negative was focused on .  It was better in the past but recent managers hired from the outside were intolerable.
good,"I was excited to start on my first full time job out of college. I was motivated and dedicated. Over time, the decreasing team environment and the poor leadership took a toll on my desire to advance within the company. I was expected to do my own work as well as the work of others daily and every day was under a microscope. Accountability dissipated and it became an environment that I did not want to be a part of."
good,"Cerner has amazing benefits, you get life insurance, 401k, dental, vision, stock options. Except you are expected to be available 24/7 and are expected to work at least 50 hours a week. There are some great opportunities for career growth if you fit within the company structure. I believe it's a great place to work if you already have a wife and or family. Most people I know that go into Cerner single stay single because sadly the work/life balance isn't the best and you are left exhausted and with little time to branch out and meet others. It's a great place to start off to get some experience but be warned its a stressful work environment and you're expected to make very few if any errors while working there."
good,"Very busy, stressful, short staffed and difficult to fill support staff.  On call 24/7.  I performed running reports, postings, Security Admin and answered all questions on all systems."
good,Hours are long and expectation is that you are available in and out of the office all days of the week.  Working with bright go-getters is the best part of the job.
good,"Management does not hesitate to add more to your plate than you can handle. Day to day can be high stress, little reward. Most consultants travel schedules are intense."
good,"Cerner is a great place to work if you are single with no family or if your spouse works there too.  Great pay, benefits, and opportunity unless you are already settled down and have family and/or commitments outside work."
good,"There is plenty of opportunity for just out of college hires."
good,"Can be rated somewhere in between. Good work environment and culture."
good,"Insurance verification, bad debt, appeals, denials, reimbursement, payment posting and customer service."
good,"It is a great place to work to get your feet wet, learning that works well and what doesnt. However once you start to catch onto this, you may want to move into a position that is already doing best practice methods."
good,Cerner as a company has many great products but the priorities are all over the place.  There doesn't seem to be a cohesive strategy on developing products or what to do with them. Distance cultivates an us version them mentality.
good,Overal is a okay place to work. At the beginning we received some on the job training. Overall the training could be better and more structure. This place does work you hard and burn you out fast.
good,"Pays very well for recent grads.  Unless you dedicate your life to Cerner, you will not make it far. Use it as a job out of college to get application knowledge and experience and then go to a client site where you can make more $$."
good,"The 2nd team that I worked with made it hard to want to stay. My managers that I dealt with on a daily basis acted like little kids and caused distractions for everyone. On top of that, the company required more work out of us with less team members. This caused life/work balance to become horrible. Some days, I got to work early, left late, and worked when I got home. This left me no time to be involved activities that gave me an outlet away from work. This combination along with the poor work ethic of some team members lead me to the decision to leave."
good,"Good work life balance, fun place to work, colleagues are awesome and smart. Get to work with a variety of technologies. Chance to do something outside the developing regular applications."
good,Company is very centered around career starters and the strong culture they have developed.  Hiring strategy is focused on college campus recruiting.  Typical day is meetings all day and work getting done at night.
good,"They bring you in with the promise of advancement and opportunity and then when you excel at your position and finish it before the time frame they give you, you gt laid off. The compensation and benefits are great, but management leadership is lacking."
good,"I only worked for Cerner for just over 5 months. I typically worked 55-60 hours per week and the position I was in, was ""reactive"" by nature. I worked trouble tickets day by day, and felt like I was spinning my wheels most of the time."
good,Interactions with patients and problem solving. Working with Teachers was definitely a fun challenge.
good,"Working for Cerner was ok. At first, I didn't understand the significance of how I was contributing to my assigned department or Cerner as a whole. At the end of the internship they explained how I was contributing. It was my first time working in a coorporate setting so the experience was very different."
good,"Good Place for Learning, but Management there is lot of internal stuffs goes on, If there is change in Management wise, really good place to work and learn"
good,"The job can be enjoyable at times, but the culture leaves something to be desired. Its hard to describe a typical day. You can be doing multiple things at one time. A lot can be expected from their associates, and some believe the compensation doesn't meet the demand."
good,Typical work day included conference calls with clients discussing issues and solutions to issues.  Also troubleshooting issues and providing resolutions.  Writing and responded to email and/or voicemail.
good,Great place to gain experience  if you are new in your career. One of the best healthcare information technology companies in the industry. A lot of changes going on right now. Seems to be like they are positioning to sell the company in the near future.
good,"There gets to a point when management makes a continuous habit of repeating the time honored catch phrases of upper management, hiding aspects of the job from the employees below with very little regard to how this will affect the front line staff. Too many promises not kept, too many people who don't understand why or what the problems around us are."
good,Great entry level company but has it's downsides. Not a lot of room for advancement. Hire a lot of younger-college grads without experience. Management is on a case-by-case basis. What team you're on highly determines your success within this company.
good,Lack of work space.  more employees than desks.  Working remote should be an option especially if you travel to client sites on a regular basis.  Environment not for everyone.
good,"Mandatory OT, 80 hour work week every 3 months.  No salary increase when you are promoted, you have to wait for a possible increase at review time if your lucky"
good,"The team is pretty agile which means lots of work and lots of questions when work is not finished within a sprint. Salary increase is meaner and almost 0 bonus. Depending on the work, maybe you will have more to learn if you in the cloud team. Otherwise your experience will not help much to land you a good job in silicon valley."
good,"Remote employees are the outlier, if not  located in KC not much opportunity exist. Good place for new gradudates. Extensive training available if willing to be a road warrior."
good,"Very large, global in fact.  "
good,"Good start for fresh college graduates but not much opportunity to advance. It's great for developing your skills from class and customer service. Hope you get a good manager that is understanding, and not number crazed."
good,This company creates solutions that appropriately addresses problem areas in the healthcare system. I appreciated the opportunity to meet and work with healthcare professionals that are compassionate about the services they provide to the patients they care for.
good,"Good learning for freshers, "
good,"1. You have a pestering management that does not plan in advance and comes up with short term goals forcing the employees to meet those expectations."
good,There are high expectations for this department.  This department seems to be separated from the rest of the business at Cerner.  Salary range for a seasoned experienced biller is low.
good,"To review this company is difficult as the experience is entirely dependent on the team and manager you are assigned to. "
good,"At the time I worked there, they had an under the table 10% mandatory overtime policy.  Not sure if this is still the case."
good,"if you've already got some time under your belt and you're looking for a place to retire, Cerner is it. The company is stable, options and benefits are okay, and overall the tech is old and not advancing at a fast enough pace to intimidate anyone. You can take it easy, not work many hours, and you'll get a pretty standard pay raise to match inflation yearly. "
good,If you are a consultant you will get paid 30-40% below market value. Cerner has a fixed bonus you have to be superman to make over an 8% raise. Its a great place to come if you have no options coming out of college with zero experience.
good,"Cerner was founded in 1979 as lab workflow system and then. Cerner focused on creating a monolithic software architecture to support its network. As a result the architecture is difficult to scale and many of their systems and solutions are outdated and dysfunctional. "
good,"sourcing specialist"
good,"Great network of young and talented professionals. Historically known for low base compensation with long work days. If you enjoy the grind with a great mission - this is the company to work for. Great place to start career, but difficult to move up and make substantial income."
good,If Cerner has a plan Kansas City has not shared it.  They've taken away bonuses and forced Binding Arbitration.  More work than people and that is not getting any easier.
good,"I loved the people I worked with but am happy to have left the company. The work-life balance was a real struggle for me. If the pay was higher, maybe, but definitely not at what they are offering."
good,"Great opportunities for young professionals- however, when hired, you had very little say in the area in which you would be working. Large groups of new hires would complete a lengthy generic training program for about 2 months and then divided onto random teams. The opportunities for advancement early on was definitely a plus but the stressful work environment and long hours were tough."
good,"Cerner offers software professionals with many good opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"Cerner is a great place to work for if you are solely looking for opportunity for advancement in your career. If you stay more than 2.5 years you will make a good amount of money ... BUT ... this comes at a price (sacrifice) ... a life. But at the end of the day, life is all about priorities."
good,"-Value for the hard work. You will always get appreciations for your hard work and commitment."
good,There are lots of interesting projects. The review is completely based on the team. You might end up in a not so interesting project and hate the job. I know people for whom that has happened.
good,Good company to work for but the work/life balance is way out of control. Salaries are not up to par with other companies in the industry.
good,Cerner would be a much better place if they didn't try to mold associates into what they want them to be rather than let them build on the skills that they come to the company with.
good,"I'll start by saying Cerner has excellent benefits. Better than most companies these days. They also have very competitive compensation from what I hear, though to be fair I have heard horror stories of people in management making way less than they should. "
good,"I joined Siemens Health Services in april 2014 with was acquired by Cerner on Feb 2015 . I do not have much experience about life and work at Cerner Corporation because we are still working from our Siemens Location and also on the same product."
good,"Working for Cerner isn't too bad and pay well for those right out of college.  The main problems are that the company is expanding so quickly that almost no one has proper training, including managers.  "
good,Cerner is a nice place to work at with a broad level of challenges and expectations.  The clients are very demanding and appreciative of a job well done.  The palates of the clients are often very simple and uneducated.  This can lead to huge acknowledgements for a simple cuisine.
good,"-Good work environment"
good,"Cerner is very nice; most campuses are new and have cafe, gym, and healthe clinic; however, the workload can be stressful and demanding.  Some of the smartest people I have met were associates at Cerner."
good,"payment posting, a/r, and other task assigned; most enjoyable was learning something new and the work environment; hardest part is working with someone that does not want to help you."
good,"I mostly enjoyed my time there because they were flexible with work schedule; however, company can be hectic with soo many leadership changes within the organization."
good,I worked 3rd party. I loved to travel and I worked with some amazing people. I gained many skills and learned so much. I tried to get on full time but it was hard to do so.
good,Good workplace.Nice people around. New technology stack to work with.located in manyata tech park.now it is moved to devanahalli.and i had a great oppurtunity to learn new technologies.
good,As mentioned above it is not a consistent management or leadership style.  The future direction of the company will require a different set of competencies then what the current management and executive team possess.
good,"Never seen a org where pretty much all the sales folks start at leadership position and in the same (or even better) career track as consultants, engineers and data scientists. Apart from building or trying to build relationships with prospects and talking about analytics solutions at a very high level, many of these folks are completely dependent on others, this even includes creating a deck with one slide."
good,Cerner offers a great library of learning experiences. It's a challenge that makes you grow immensely so long as you can endure the work life balance that it creates. The tricky part is you may find you are putting in so much effort and truly gaining knowledge but with little reward. The question is what are you wanting to get out of Cerner - the pay may not be there but the learning experience surely is.
good,"Very dynamic organization with weekly changes.  No organization charts so it's hard to understand where you fit in.  Top down directives, little if no opportunity for collaboration."
good,Pretty decent company to start your career. Started out of college was a good place of learning. Can stay here for a few years. Apart from that great company.
good,Decent place to start career. A massive company so can be difficult to navigate at times. You dont always have a say where you are going to be placed or what you are going to be doing.
good,"Good for people just starting out of school, but they don't pay for actual experience. There is not a lot of quality mentoring so new staff may get thrown into the deep end of the pool whether ready for it or not."
good,"Key Responsibilities:"
good,Good company but teams develop software and solutions in a silo.  Team work in an Agile - Scrum environment is paramount but Cerner needs to break down the barriers and have an open development environment.
good,"Good company, no upward mobility, small yearly raises from 2-5%"
good,"Cerner is a corporate job that you get your feet into after college. They have a very fast paced environment that if you don't keep up in, can easily leave you behind."
good,It's a large company and easy to get lost in the numbers. A great place to gain some experience. They try and make it easy to move around within the company.
good,HQ is a great place to work but the client sites are not up to par. I have a great time in my first position as my manager was great and allowed room for growth.
good,"I found that Cerner is geared to the younger polulation. I did work for Cerner, but was based at Raritan Bay Medical Center for 19 years.  Once that contract ended because of EPIC systems, there was nowhere for me to advance."
good,"-A good place to work"
good,"You might not get the project you want to work on."
good,Great opportunity for learning.  Promotion based largely on networking skills.  Management need to harness experienced knowledge. Great sales type personalities.
good,"While the company has many opportunities for entry level positions, there aren't many opportunities for upward movement. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the clients. The workplace culture in Kansas City if very positive, however, this is not the same experience in the Malvern location."
good,"Cerner is always changing, you must be open to this or its not right for you. Management also changes like clock work. You can have flexible hours which is a plus. Work from home option as been taken away. You can do yoga on Tuesdays. Ping pong tables, pool tables, and air hockey table for your 15 minute breaks."
good,"Cerner is a great company with an exceptional workforce. They work hard and play hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is working the people in my team day in, day out. It makes the job so much easier."
good,"Good healthcare IT company headquartered in an underrated city, Kansas City. "
good,"This is great for new graduates, but not professionals with family at home. Way too much travel and long hours. I also think they shift teams too much. It is hard to gain consistency with the teams this way."
good,"No advancement, leaving most consultants running for the door after 2 years. There is heavy travel and bare minimum raises year over year. Work effort is not factored in, only tenure. The only want to make any money here is to either stay for 20 years or come in as an external hire for a significant amount."
good,"The company has its ups and downs. As a consultant/architect, there was so much travel involved and so much work and duties with little compensations."
good,Be willing to live in a hotel room. Not much room to move up. Pay is decent. You will be primarily client facing and will do most of your work presenting in front of classroom
good,"Cerner is an outstanding company to work for if you have a passion for the IT Healthcare industry. There is room for transition, but only after you have been in your current position for a minimum of 18 months."
good,"The people with whom I worked with daily were excellent and became like family. The management structure created gaps in knowledge of their department. Team leaders did not have proper education on how to manage and thus did not have the skills to communicate, nurture, and promote their team. Individual employees were many times ""stuck"" in their job as managers could not or would not do anything to help place those people to where their skills could have been better used."
good,"Cerner is an excellent company for recent graduates looking for entry level experience. However, once hired they work employees tirelessly with little recognition. There are a few opportunities for advancement within each team, but the management institutes an 18 month rule for applying out and if you do not get the job you apply for there is a good chance another opportunity will not come around for a while. By doing this, they ensure employees stay positioned in entry level jobs where they constantly need help due to high turnover. Staffing is a constant issue and consequently employees are expected to take on more responsibility without the incentive of promotion or higher compensation. The people who work there are great and team-oriented, but management is similarly over-worked and it is easy for employees to feel overworked and underappreciated as a result.   "
good,Good people to work with and great experiences among different campuses.  Felt empowered yet hinder by divided direction due to multiple leaders and duties
good,"Working at Cerner requires a driven individual who does not rely on others. Must be okay with little to no work/life balance while working at the company. Traveling can be a pro or a con depending on the person, however, don't expect your manager, or manager's manager to assist you in getting any changes to your schedule going."
good,"Although the pay was great, i was not fond of management at the local facility. Very judgemental with their employees personal life. They use their own personal feelings against their employees."
good,"Almost all entry-level jobs are a traveling role, which means every weeks is a flight to a different city.  After traveling from Sunday to Thursday, we were still expected to spend time in the office on our Friday off.  One work week constantly included at least 50-60 hours, and it was not uncommon to work five 12-hour days in a row, not including travel time.  There was very little relevant training experience or preparation, and you are constantly thrown onto client sites and told to figure it out.  Despite all this, employees who excel are not rewarded, but are treated just as poorly as employees who fail at their job, even to the extent of abusing the corporate credit card.  We were constantly treated as expendable."
good,"To work with a company that has so much history in the health care business was exhilarating. However, the long hours and the smoke and mirrors the upper management protruded was discouraging. I enjoyed working with the client we worked with to a point, however, the 3rd party-client environment was poisonous to everyone around."
good,"Basic sausage grinder methodology for winnowing college hires. Throw bodies at consulting work, and sweep the engineering quality under the rug. "
good,Great company with fantastic benefits and opportunities world wide.  Cerner is very active in an individuals over all health and well being.  Cerner is engaged with their work associates from day one of employment.
good,"Cerner Is a nice Place to work, we will get to learn the helath care imortance, coming to management its good & supportive along with the good work culture"
good,"I moved to Cerner when thy bought out Siemens Healthcare.  Since that time, my job became more difficult and I was unable to keep up, and I was terminated,"
good,"Managers are poor, not properly compensated for amount of work expected. Huge turn around rate with people constantly leaving. Job morale is very low in the office"
good,i was there for about 2.5 years. it is a great company to work for with great benefits. the hours can be long and travel depending on your role. i would recommend for any new grad.
good,Enjoyed working with coworkers. It was a fun place to work.  Work/Life balance was great.  I enjoyed training new hires.  Hardest part of the job was leaving.
good,EMR program offered in inpatient rehab setting that provided opportunity for quick charting with click features and free text locations to expand on information as needed
good,"Good company , good place to work. Facilities and benefits are good. Work pressure will be more. Good salary. Its product based company.Healthcare domain."
good,"Busy business**"
good,"The deadlines are very tight, and you have multiple client engagements that you are responsible for which can be a challenge when you are traveling or if you have a family.  It was hard to have a good work balance.  But if you work hard, and put in the time, it does pay off for in advancement"
good,I have learned a lot bout there solutions and work life balance. Cerner offers many opportunities you don't know about until you become an associate. Cerner's employment practices are different than most companies. This is also information you don't learn until you become an associate.
good,Cerner has a good work culture and it is an employee empowered company. The employees will have work life balance and some teams provide opportunities to travel abroad.
good,"Good place to work, but change is the only constant. Fast-paced, with tight deadlines and a lot of pressure. Typically takes a long time to advance because managers tend to block you."
good,Cerner is a growing company and there are great opportunities for advancement. There are draw backs that come with a fast growing company; Employees are often over-worked and not payed a competitive salary.
good,"Definitely lacking in employee recognition. It takes a long time to move anywhere in that company. They're a large corporation, but they act like they're a mom and pop shop that cannot give their employees decent benefits."
good,"It was senior dominant culture where new entrees didn't have much of an opportunity to voice their opinions. The manager was partial to  some people. As a team , my team was great."
good,There are numerous job roles at Cerner for various skill sets.  It is a faced paced company and people often change positions frequently.  Solid benefits and nice people.
good,None. I recently stopped working for Cerner and I signed a non-compete agreement. I will not make a public statement about Cerner or any of it's subsidiaries.
good,"This is a great place to start your career and if you really love the Mid-West, a great place to work if you plan on settling there. "
good,The was my first job out of graduate school and I have to say this where I learned how to become a professional. I worked a lot hours and even crashed my honda civic coming into work during a winter. storm.
good,Good opportunity for new college graduates. This work is very technical as well as analytical. The company maintains a good work environment but be prepared to work and travel a lot and get paid for a regular work week.
good,"Good work life balance but no learning"
good,"Pros; There are tons of opportunity within Cerner and the growth "
good,Great as a starter work place and if you are single and family time isn't important. They expect a lot of overtime work and it can often lead to missing events.
good,The work/life culture is great. A lot of activities for the associates to network and get to know each other. Good benefits and great top leadership who care about their employees
good,"development scope is good, management scope is very poor, no plan for employees career progression, lots of politics, an immature organization, needs lots of improvement"
good,Cerner Corporation  is having a  good place to start career with using the latest technologies in the current market  and has a gym facility which can utilised after office hours  and keep ourself healthy at workplace and active.
good,"If you are a virtual associate then it is very challenging to be incorporated into your team.  Almost impossible for much opportunity for advancement.  "
good,"Cerner is like most companies in there are good parts and bad parts.  They do train so that is positive. Travel is a nice side benefit but they are business trips.  Good advancement possibilities but will require a lot of extra work, long hours, and a longer timeline than some other places I have worked."
good,"%100 travel nationwide, fun working in teams out on assignments. Frequent training sessions, can be a high-stress environment depending on clients workflows."
good,Cerner tends to hire fresh college graduates that are top of their class which sets up a culture to have high expectations. Working overtime is expected without pay.
good,"A very ambitious company.  They are growing extremely fast and are highly motivated.  Speed does not lend itself to efficiency, which the company finds tolerable if results are met in a 'somewhat' timely fashion.  This mindset is geared to the younger generation as they have the work/life balance available that tends to lean toward 'work' aspect more favorably."
good,"I enjoy working here, however the compensation isn't spread out in regards to work performance. The company does a good job with giving you just enough to want to stay and not look other places."
good,"The worst part about working for Cerner is the expectations are set so incredibly high for the associates almost to the point you are set up for failure.  It is an extremely high pressure place to work in certain roles.  Associates in consulting regularly put 60hrs of work, but are not adequately rewarded in their salary."
good,"-Collaborating with team members to have a successful project"
good,"Decent work life balance can be attained "
good,"No new technology to learn."
good,"Cerner is good company but no new technology to learn."
good,"I work at a client location for this company.  At this location there is very little room for advancement without going to a different location.  The compensation is excellent for the area.  I am also working in a role that this company is really just starting to branch out into.  As such I don't believe that the management always has realistic goals or processes, at least locally."
good,"Great place to work with smart and humble people."
good,"It was really nice to work, People around are supportive. Good place to learn more about healthcare domain. Work environment is good"
good,"Honestly, Its luck of the draw of how your employment with Cerner will be.It depends on where and who you get placed with. Like every large company it has its perks as well as its downsides."
good,Very busy fast paced environment. Chance to learn and expand. Poor health Insurance. A lot of hours put in on salary pay. Overall a good opportunity but could burn you out if you don't balance work life.
good,Helpful and good social co-workers though good challenging work environment.  Need to be proactive for all changes in the organization.
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. Very professional and passionate individuals, with a good product and worthy ethos behind everything."
good,"This is a very corporate-based organization. Day is filled with back to back meetings, which makes it very difficult to be productive when managing staff. Many issues with software. Enjoyable to work with staff."
good,I was placed on a team in which communication was not practiced.  I essentially had to train myself.  I think I would have enjoyed the company more if I had been on a different team.
good,Great place to work if you are self motivated and passionate about the healthcare industry. Lots of opportunity for growth in the field if you are willing to relocate.
good,I worked on application support tickets and my day went pretty fast. I liked the interaction that I had with our customers and I took a lot of pride in being able to solve their difficult issues. I worked with some amazing people in support. We had a solid team.
good,They provide a very supportive culture with co-workers and there is always somebody willing to help if you get bogged down.
good,This was a really cool place to work and it saddens me they had to close their doors due to greedy owners and a poor choice of investors.
good,Exciting careers.  Many locations.  Great teamwork.  Too much travel.
good,Our team in Cerner Corporation develops applications for the physicians. Used to follow pure Agile.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to travel around the world and assist with project conversions and floor walk during conversions assisting hospital staff with the change management process. "
good,Decent benefits but too much work where its a typical 60-70 hours per week.
good,Good place to work with plenty of learning resources but difficult work life balance.
good,"Developing custom solutions based on client requirements."
good,"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City Jan’11 to Current"
good,"Much more than security. Learn aspects of being an admin as well, as you create accounts, print badges, create guest notifications, and send calendar invites."
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Cerner as the people were wonderful to work with, however the work/life balance was almost non-existent. Travelling a lot, often on weekends, with no comp time to make up for the weekends away from home."
good,"Working at Cerner is a great starting point.  There's always plenty of work with so many solutions and products to work on. Almost my whole professional career has been here and I still couldn't tell you the huge number of things they have under their ownership. However, it is a large growing systematic machine. It'll cut what doesn't work and expand what does. Since it is so large, one's purpose often feels lost in translation and motivation can be difficult when abstracted so far from the end-users."
good,"Cerner Bangalore is a good place to work. Work life balance is good."
good,"The salary and benefits were pretty good. Straight out of college it may have been on the low end and career advancement was a little slow. Biggest raise came from leaving Cerner for a client, and then coming back a couple years later. There is almost too many middle-management/directors, but with one or two exceptions, all of the managers I reported to, I was happy to have as my manager."
good,"An entrepreneurial/sometimes chaotic environment doing important work, those who care about the mission care deeply.  Lots of benefits like gym and onsite cafeteria, somewhat flexible work times and locations.  Success and work-life balance mostly depends on what area of the business you're in and who the leaders are."
good,"Working at Cerner at least in the capacity as I did at an ITworks site is difficult work. You will learn more in a short amount of time then you ever thought possible. There is a reason they recognize your employment at 2 years of service with a small gift and badge indicator where most companies do this starting at 5 years. However with this being said if you put forth some effort, be dependable, and show how you can solve difficult issues and work within those constraints they do promote from within and you will move up quickly. I have seen people (myself included) move from relatively low end positions to what would be considered high end sought after positions with large responsibilities in just a few short years. Cerner is also a large company so even if the position you want to move up and into is not within your current team or area of location chances are it exists within the grater company as a whole. They do have the motto ""work hard play hard"" and while i do a lot of the work hard there is not a lot of the play hard or even time for it in my experiences. This is the one area where I believe the culture in the company as a whole suffers the greatest in. Overall though it isn't a bad place to work for and if you are looking for a place to lean a bunch of new skills and develop your skill sets as an employee it is a great place to work. If you do not work well under pressure however I would probably consider another place of employment though."
good,Another situation where you should probably reseatch and know what you are getting into. I was hired on for a particular role only to be forced to switch to a different and less-desirable role. you have no say about what you want to do with your career or within the company once hired on.
good,"Cerner likes to hire right out of college and does not value seasoned associates as much as other companies.  They hold on to old processes (not development related) that add little to No value."
good,Cerner is a very welcoming and promising environment to start your career. it will provide you many opportunities to both hone and expand your skillset.
good,"Cerner corporation has great compensation/benefit packages.  However, work/life balance is off because of the high expectations, volume of work, and strict deadlines."
good,"I learned a lot, most of what IO learned was not actually at Cerner but at Siemens. Cerner Purchased Siemens in 2016. I started in the mail room at Siemens in 2003 and worked my way up to a senior position in 2016 at Cerner."
good,"I was hired with SMS which eventually became Siemens and now Cerner. So technically, I have been with the same company for a long time but we were merging with different companies. The workplace culture is really good, people are friendly and work together very well. The relationships I have with my co-workers are really awesome. But at this point, I want to try something new and different. Salary is negotiable, so hope you give me a chance. Thx."
good,"I worked in the hospitals training clients at the elbow on how to use Cerner software. I worked 12 hour shifts (which were actually 13 hours since you had to check in 30 minutes before your shift and stay 30 minutes later for shift change meetings. I would do 4 12's during the day shift, fly home for less than 36 hours and then be back out, working 3+ 12's on the night shift in another state, possibly in a time zone 3 hours different."
good,"At Cerner, there is a lot of training.  The orientation is 6 weeks of information overload.  No one has a clear understanding of exactly what they are going to do.  The training process needs to be revamped so that it is solution specific and has a rotation of classroom and shadowing. they currently have 6+ weeks of orientation and 4 weeks of shadowing ."
good,"High stress sometimes. There's a great culture, but the turnover is high. Consultants are kind of thrown to the wolves and are left to figure things out themselves. Must be adaptable to be successful here."
good,Cerner is a great company to work for when you are coming out of college. You learn a lot of useful tools that can be extremely helpful when trying to move forward in your career.  The travel is heavy depending on the organization you end up working in. You can be overworked when they are short staffed.
good,I was a high stress quick paced job for me and I was only an intern maybe research your position if you are hired and make sure you know what you are diving into or you might regret it
good,"Working at this company challenged your mind to solve pieces of a puzzle "
good,Layed back and steady days.  Work 4 ten hour days.  Doctors and nurse practitioners are good to work for.  Good benefits.  Offices are nice and up-to-date.
good,"Cerner is a challenging place to work. There is a lot to learn, in a fast paced environment. Several career paths, locations, an industry technologies to learn."
good,"It can be a good place to first start your career. You can network and gain basic skills needed to succeed in Corporate America. However, this is not a long-term job or organization. "
good,"This is a place where you can get opportunity to learn many new skills."
good,"The dress code is laid back, jeans and a work-appropriate T-shirt is OK. Work experiences vary across all the organizations that make up the company as a whole. Some roles are overworked, while others are not, it depends on what your job function is at the company."
good,"It's ok for the most part, but they ask a lot of you at times with little in return.  Not all departments operate in this fashion, but many do.  Also, in the last several months they have hired right out of college and provided little training.  These kids don't know how to reconcile a credit card let alone handle a project for a large hospital."
good,The new campus has been great for engineers and helps with the daily mood but Cerner is experiencing severe brain-drain because they refuse to compensate their best engineers a competitive salary
good,This place is good if you are planning for your pregnancy or for your higher studies. Other than that there's nothing to learn here. There's lot of scope given to girls and they get faster promotion than guys.
good,"Good workplace culture, Good Balance between your work and personal life. Fun to work and the teamwork is good, Management is overall good and the pay benefits are quite good in the company."
good,Work in my role is very repetitive and you spend most of your day doing the same thing over and over again.  The people are awesome and have nothing bad to say about management.
good,Co-workers are great people and very capable.  Traveling is nice but can be overwhelming sometimes given the work load that is put on consultants.  Need to improve project balance
good,"this organisation is very good for freshers and the person who want to settle down after marriage. and growth is slow."
good,"Overall, Cerner offers numerous entry level positions to college grads with a good starting pay rate. Most employees traveled a high percentage and were expected to work 40 hours or more per week. The jobs within consulting seemed to be very stressful and high pressure for the most part"
good,Cerner is a great place to work. It has great potential and much to grow in the future as a IT healthcare company. It was a pleasure to work there.
good,This the best company I have ever worked with. Employees get lot of growth opportunities. Management is quite friendly. I learnt about US Healthcare here. Many of my best buddies are my co-workers from this company. Sometimes I really miss office in the weekends :-)
good,"Cerner is a good first job. Great training off the bat and high level of responsibility. Advancement is difficult for the first few years and raises are about at industry averages despite the enormous growth of the company."
good,"It seems that every week I hear from my project leadership how our team makes our project as good as it is. Unfortunately, the only thing that determines any monetary reward is how many hours we put in each quarter. It's obvious that Cerner values quantity over quality, except when it comes to employee pay."
good,It is good. Depends on the team you one is in. It can either be good or bad. Co workers are good. They help quite a bit.
good,"I started Cerner out of college and I liked that they tended to hire a lot of people who were in a similar life position as me. So you got to make friends and socialize in an almost college atmosphere. But what Cerner gets by hiring people in that life position, are people who believe it's normal to put in 60+ hour weeks and work through the night on projects because the scope kept changing. As you grow in Cerner, you either continue to believe that or start to desire a more equitable work/life balance."
good,"Cerner is a great place for someone right out of school to start the career. The culture is very high pace, things change constantly. There are a lot of young, ambitious and smart people to learn from. They do provide significant training. The compensation is below market."
good,"Cerner is very flexible because everything is manager discretion. However, if you have a manager that is punitive and likes to micromanage people then it's a horrible experience. But they pay well. Unfortunately they lie a lot and lay off without any real warning or reason."
good,"Cerner has amazing benefits. It is one of the best parts about working for the company. In my experience at Cerner, management has been very hit or miss. I have been in 4 roles while at Cerner and in some of those roles I had very poor leadership. They aren't willing to give out bonuses or any pay increases until annual reviews. Even during the annual review cycle you are not guaranteed much. They aren't competitive with pay."
good,"Travel and work life balance is something that is always hard to achieve. I find that depending on the department you work in, management can be more understanding/forgiving and work with you on creating more stability.. but some can not be."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Lots of processes and meetings are required to take some small work to completion which can kill productivity in people"
good,Depending on how many bosses you end up having at one location they never seem to be on the same page and the drive for results are different every week.
good,"Working at Cerner can be a great experience if you are lucky enough to be placed on a team that works well together and allows you to do your job. Cerner is also a great place to move up through the ranks, but only if you know someone influential enough to put in a good word for you. The people are friendly, but the hardest part can be getting work completed as a non-salaried employee."
good,Work days are productive with quality colleagues. The people are nice and willing to assist with issues. The culture is generally positive but at times work becomes very repetitive. Managers are excellent. Career advancement is widely opened and expressed.
good,"Cerner is a great place to work.  They encourage community involvement, good health, career development while offering decent benefits. Depending what campus location you are at you also enjoy ergonomic desk spaces, pool, and a daycare."
good,"It's a nice place to start after graduation but it can be frustrating after a few years."
good,Technical exposure is very good to learn and very much productive workplace. Apart from job profile there was no extra benefits in my profile. Overall experience was good.
good,"Great opportunity for someone just graduating. Work/life balance not the best for those who travel a lot. I would like to see the Cerner culture in the consulting department change (not sure about the other departments), in being more willing to teach and answer questions, instead of it being understood that we should look up things ourselves."
good,"This really depends on the position, but they will work you very hard. 60+ hours a week is pretty regular. It's a great company with a great mission, but it's somewhat hard to advance because they will lead you on and somewhat deceive you about your advancement. Management in my department was very disappointing."
good,"The culture is relaxed and you have good benefits, such as working remote if something comes up in your personal life. There's rarely consistent work. It's either stress and work overload, or not much to pass the day with."
good,"Good place to work. Salaries are reasonable. Benefits are pretty good. Career advancement at this location is difficult, but if willing to relocate,Cerner has multiple offices all over the world."
good,"My employer, a medical software company, was acquired by Cerner in November of 2012. The company and most of the staff remained in Arizona, while some where offered positions in Kansas City or laid off eventually. While the remaining AZ staff is important to the company, it is a question whether the company will keep their Arizona office, once the acquired product is fully integrated into their product."
good,Working at Cerner can be stressful but it can also be fun.  It depends on which team you work for. Change is constant and it often feels that we are reacting to changes which can lead to stressful situation.  The attitude of doing more with less have residual impact on current employees and often leads people out of the company.   Upper management push employees to do more with less.  Most teams are often operating with less than ideal number of employees.
good,"Good place to work. Good environment, but not enough advancement. Would recommend Cerner to anyone looking for a great career. Can be a starting point or a life long career. Depends on the field you get into and how far you want and can advance."
good,Great company to start out with to get your feet wet in the healthcare IT industry. They hire alot of kids right out of college. Great opportunity to work here to gain experience and make new life long friends. Only a handful that I started out with have stuck around over the years due to the long hours and stress.
good,There is a reason this place has been so successful and it is because the employees have a cut throat competition to reach higher rungs on the ladder. High tech and fun new gadgets and innovative opportunity for those who excel with creativity and willingness to devote all days and nights getting ahead of their workmate.
good,"Cerner hires huge amounts of college grads with the expectation that very few will stay past the first year or two. It is very much a move up or move out atmosphere."
good,"Decent compensation, but no regard for the fact that everyone works for more than 40 hours a week. A lot of ambiguity about what your actual job will be until weeks into training."
good,"I became a Cerner employee through an acquisition.  I was a remote employee, so I didn't see the day to day at Cerner's KC headquarters, I was out in the field working with customers.  "
good,"My job was called a ""support analyst."" It should have really been called a ""Help Desk Associate."" I sat at a desk with a headset all day and answered countless calls and had to try to troubleshoot with customers who were having issues with Cerner Software (or really computers in general). We WERE a call center. Every day was long and busy. The work wasn't too hard, but there was no work social life. We never had Christmas parties or anything because everyone had to be available for a phone call at all times. This made every single day of every week of every month, slog by so so so slowly."
good,My greatest gift obtained while being employed at Cerner was opening my eyes to teaching a group fitness type of class.  I learned that my gift wasn't only in a 1-1 situation but also teaching and motivating classes with 3 to 20 participants.
good,I accepted a VSP because no group wanted administrative responsibility for my position. Wasn't sure the job would last. I enjoyed working with clients and colleagues very much. The technical component of upgrades for SQM was not difficult; knowing the CMS guidelines in order to assist client choices for content was the critical part of the job.
good,"Cerner was an incredible company to start working for.  Unfortunately, that's all they really have going for them. "
good,This company creates solutions that appropriately addresses problem areas in the healthcare system. I appreciated the opportunity to meet and work with healthcare professionals that are compassionate about the services they provide to the patients they care for.
good,"Innovative company, irregular hours and less work,life and family balance"
good,- Very agile
good,It's a good place to work if you are technical and can handle the learning curve. There's a lot of information to consume and sometimes people get down on themselves if they don't get it right away.
good,Good place to work enjoy the work culture get a raise every year. Manager is great to work for  really dont have to many complaints just uneasy with the firing that is currently occurring
good,"Great for new college grads looking for experience. No work life balance, plenty of travel. Internalize what you can from the company and plan your next move."
good,"Life in the ER is fast-paced, but it was a fun place to work and never boring.  Great place to learn and grow.  Trying to keep up with the pace of the ER is always a challenge but one my teammates and I thrived to complete."
good,"Working here now for many years (15+). I love the company, especially the people I worked with over the years, but they are obviously not a truly international company. The only way to further your career at Cerner is to move to Kansas city. I've been told that multiple times, and have experienced it first hand."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, I learned a lot about insurance and the medical field. The management could use work as my director was never able to properly solve any workplace problems. Workplace culture was overall relaxed and productive, unfortunately rude and moody coworkers could be very nasty without any punishment. The hardest part of the job was frustrated customers that would demand I fix things that were not within my power because they were tired of being bounced around. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers, aside from the few bad eggs (which unfortunately ruined my experience), my coworkers were all very hard workers and amazing."
good,"Younger crowd to work with. Typically well rounded minds in support that know how to trouble shoot. Learning Cerner Software to add to your resume. Great healthcare, clinics are in almost every location so seeing a doctor is very easy. They have a gym on most campuses as well as a cafeteria (Can get pricey)"
good,"I would recommend Cerner, it was a very nice company to work for.  I learned a lot about the medical industry and systems.  It was a very good experience."
good,Great for beginners who want the experience to obtain a career in health it. Pay is ok for consultants. Regardless of degree they stick you wherever there is a business need.
good,"Cerner has a great, friendly environment, but the work is typically consisted of very robotic, hard work. I learned working here an immense amount of knowledge regarding Medical Billing, Accounts Receivable, and Payment Posting."
good,"As a college grad's first job, Cerner provided a good environment and start to the workforce. There is plenty of opportunity for learning consulting skills, people skills, and other professional skills that translate well to other jobs. Unfortunately the pay for the amount of work you end up doing is not sufficient for many people, causing high turnover."
good,Very good place for freshers to get IT exposure. Work day typically depends on the team you are part of. Fortunately I was part of a really good team.
good,Cerner is a great place to build you work experience.  It is one of the best Health Care IT companies to work for.  They are are a global company so there's a good chance you will be able to travel around the world.
good,"Life and work balance is biggest challenge. Most positions require travel. This aspect is great, but can be challenge if you have a family. Co-workers are average to work with. Most keep to themselves and collaborate only when needed. If you prefer this type of environment it works out well. The most enjoyable part of the job was supporting clients with their needs. The hardest was keeping up with management changes. The person you report to changes often."
good,"Cerner is a computer program.  Day at work consists of medical record reviews, setting up home health or DME. SNF placements. Talking to pts about DC planning."
good,"I really liked the industry they are on right now, Health care is one of the growing industries and if IT is along with it then it can have sky as limit."
good,Great pace and people I enjoy the culture and new experiences I have had as far as technology and moving foward with advanced computer gadgets.I float through out the wellness Center's
good,the relaxed atmosphere is great the staff make life enjoyable.  Always postings just not jobs that I am qualified to do; if you are an IT person this is the place to be.
good,"Cerner tried to keep my work weeks limited to 40 hours. The company also strove to harbor a fun environment to work in whenever possible. Employees at Cerner associate with one another heavily outside of work which is also nice. However I was moved from team to team throughout my one year at Cerner with little to no notice or opportunity for input. I found myself in an albeit stable, but unenjoyable job that virtually reset my Cerner career after nearly a full year at the company. Furthermore the opportunities for career advancement were few and far between."
good,"Company is growing faster than staff can be trained and therefore new staff are put on client sites before they are fully trained.  Great company, but they need to provide more training before sending out new staff to clients."
good,"Learning curve is very low in most of the teams, not a good place to start with."
good,"I have learned a lot at Cerner and can apply my skills anywhere. Although, Cerner does not pay for all of the work that is expected. I dedicate my hard work and life to the workplace but have stresses outside of work due to not being paid for my worth."
good,"Tough to get a good start, you may not be placed in a position that you desire. Training is worthless and the type of work you'll be doing out of the gate will not be what you want to do."
good,I always felt like I could go anywhere in the world. ACE's are a blast and there are SO many opportunities. I'm really glad it was my first job.
good,"Cerner is a company that has a great idea. Unfortunately, they changed many things that my company prided itself on. The benefits are not good and seriously affect the take home pay. The processes in place are not up to par. It is not the worst company I have worked for, but not the best."
good,"Cerner is not a bad place , it helps with learning new skills as you can and move onto to something better. In all I will recommend this place to new grads to start up with before moving on in the corporate world."
good,Cerner is a great company to learn and grow.  They are very results driven and pay for performance.  You have to manage your work life balance very closely because the workload is high and deliverable timelines can be a little unreasonable.  It is easy to get burnt out if you are not managing your balance.
good,"Working at Cerner is fun, you have amazing benefits and you get to be on client calls and meetings and really feel like you are doing something with your career. The only downside is the continuous travel."
good,Great company to work for at a young age with fantastic benefits.  Work life balance can be poor. The leadership has an excellent eye for direction and vision that is shared with our clients.
good,"A typical day at work consist of computer work, spreadsheets, emails, inventory, self management delivery runs along with a lot more responsibilities.  Working at Cerner has been a huge culture shock because I learned how many different countries Cerner is located out of and how many different cultures are here in the Kansas City locations.  The most enjoyable part of my job is Managing the donation process for Cerner.  I donate devices to different organization across the world.  It is a very hard process but also a very rewarding responsibility."
good,Good place to gain experience after school. Stepping stone of opportunity. Management is not your friend. Company hires young grads for low costs and burns them out in a couple years. Only the morally inept thrive here.
good,"The company is a great place to work for overall. But they don't value Testing the way that most companies do, Wins are not celebrated and if you have an issue it will not be solved by management."
good,"The major leagues of support, Cerner is a tough and stressful enviroment. Those who succeed here can succeed anywhere. Play hard and you will go far at Cerner"
good,This company has a very hectic work culture. They don't even spare the weekends. If you are a work-a-holic this is the place to be. Not much of career growth in terms of promotions.
good,Great internship and technology experience. I got my feet wet at H & R Block but this Company expands responsibility and challenges individuals ideas about their vocation.
good,"Cerner was a great teacher I learned so much while working there, the issue is there is no communication and leadership will not explain what is going on. On the RevWorks side leadership wants nothing to do with the associates or supervisors, they do not listen to what the supervisors tell them. There is no follow through and nothing in writing."
good,This is an organization for new young professionals seeking to learn about Healthcare and how the realm of IT impacts the value of providing quality care and service. This is NOT a company for season professions who are seeking career advancement opportunities.
good,Job description isn’t clear for a technical solutions analysts. Didn’t expect to be sitting all day. For someone who went to school for technology and got a concentration in Healthcare informatics who likes to talk to people and teach. You would think he would be a lot more useful out in the hospitals  and not behind a desk all day being spoken to rudely and hung up on by nurses and doctors.
good,Most opportunities are in tech jobs.  Other roles are sometimes under appreciated.  Work/life balance is historically an issue at Cerner.  Salary level seems low for early career but improve at higher levels.
good,a typical work day was fast pasted and you did a lot  the best part about working in the healthcare field is that it is constantly changing and you never get bored.
good,"I appreciate all that Cerner has done for me and my family.  Associates do turnover at a higher rate than average which generally leaves the company a bit short on deep, industry and business knowledge except at the top levels of management."
good,"Cerner is a great company. It has a strong drive to help the world and that comes through in the culture. The only thing the company will need to adapt in the future is the way it is driven. There are a lot of positions in the company filled by associates between twenty two and forty years old, and so as they pursue their careers the company will need to increase their compensation and identify ways for them to grow in their careers in a saturated field."
good,"Good company, decent management, no work/life balance "
good,Most enjoyable part was working with kind people . The work was tough but rewarding. I would've stayed there forever if I wasn't laid off. I was surrounded by great people.
good,"You'll have excellent opportunities to learn and take on responsibility as well as a chance to work with the latest tech. "
good,Work is not very stressful and culture is fun. The best is the flexibility to move into any profile within the company. But with frequent changes coming in the role profiles growth ladder is very difficult to climb
good,"Cerner is a great place to get your foot in the door of an IT career, but within the company, every employee seems to be just a number.  I had supervisors/managers I'd never met face to face because of the sheer amount of employees within that company.  However, day to day work was made fun, they had activities and outings and such to build morale and team work.  I did enjoy my time - but I had to leave due to the commute I was making every day and I couldn't afford it."
good,"Pro: Great people, pretty good place to work depending on your manager. "
good,"Cerner can be a very good place to work if you have a good manager/director.  If you do have a bad one, they can get away with making comments that would get them written up somewhere else but not at cerner."
good,"The work you get to do here challenges you and helps you grow.  There are many internal education/learning opportunities.  If you are committed and motivated, you will likely be successful."
good,Cerner is a great place to start your career in healthcare IT. Depending on what department you are placed you could get lucky and have a great career and stay there.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cerner and was proud to be apart of the team. Lots of opportunities for growth, amazing onsite amenities (including clinics, gym, and cafeteria). My only complaint is with management. "
good,"If you are wanting to get your feet wet as an engineer this isnt a bad place to do it. "
good,"The culture at Cerner has transitioned over the last 14 years.  Unfortunately, we lost one of our founders due to cancer, and the other two have retired.  Since then I feel that the company is currently being run by individuals that do not encompass the same vision as the original founders."
good,"Cerner offers a lot of great opportunity for Associates at the world head quarters campus. I work at a satellite site and it is very difficult to get support tech when there are issues. Support gives you the run around on the phone and it almost impossible to complete tasks with computer issues regularly."
good,"I enjoy working at Cerner, but the compensation is not close to what it should be for the amount of work we are required to do. They should increase the salary for people coming in with a good amount of experience."
good,good for single individuals or individuals looking to have job security. People are great to work and are always willing to help and learn. Great place to build your professionalism.
good,"Fun place to work but compensation not good"
good,"I enjoy working with my current employer. There is always something interesting and new to learn. I have been fortunate over the the years to work with good people, and pick up on new skills"
good,Leader in the market and have all advanced systems that simplifies the job and the managements interventions is at all levels.
good,As a learning Consultant you travel 90% of the time.  You learn multiple EHR solutions.  Co-workers are usually young and right out of college.
good,"Poor managers work employees to death, and favoritism inhibits advancement. Archaic techniques for annual raises tends to embitter employees. Management rolls out new policies, regardless of feedback from associates actually tasked with performing the job."
good,"It is a great place to work right after you graduate college, but the culture seems to lean towards leaving the company after you have been there for a few years. There aren't thatmany associates that have worked there for more than 10 years. It was fun to work with a lot of people who were recent college graduates."
good,"-Great team work"
good,"Work M-F 45 hours per week. Fun culture, a lot of room to grow. Able to work one on one or with a team. Hardest part pay was not enough but provided benefits."
good,"Overall, Cerner is a good company with great products.  They have a large market share with 25,000 employees across the globe.  At times they spend too much time on process rather than results."
good,"Great benefits, not so great work and life balance. Management is decent- it really vaires. Compensation is only good because I'm hourly and get lots of time and a half due to so many overtime hours."
good,Typical 8 to 9 hours of work. What cloud computing is. Management is kind of okay. Workplace culture is good. Hardest part is to switch technologies or teams you're working in.
good,Cerner is a great company to work for. The managers take the time to listen. It is a very collaborative environment that encourages growth. I have been fortunate enough to have very good mentors.
good,"Pros"
good,"You are expected to work over the standard 40 hours a week, it can and will regularly require you to work up to 60 |70 | 80 hours a week. This time is not monitored nor rewarded."
good,"Cerner is a mission focused organization that is focused on partnering with clients in order to develop and enhance products that assist medical professionals, improve patient care, and the overall healthcare system."
good,"It was primarily and IT support role for healthcare organizations as clients.  Cerner did a reasonable job of training and preparing us for supporting the applications and accounts of the various customers we supported. Once you got accustom to the pace of the support calls and related duties, it was well balanced.  I left there due to lay offs as a result of our division being sold to Cerner from Siemens."
good,Good company if you have a family - great benefits and opportunities with well-paying positions available. For younger people this job is a lot more than they bargained for - they like to hire young graduates without families so they can pay them lower salaries and still have them spend most of their time traveling and working 50-60hr weeks.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Cerner.  I worked really hard with a great team.  We tackled meaningful, difficult problems and had a lot of success.  I look back with fondness on my time at Cerner."
good,"I taught myself a lot.  Learned about office politics.  I'd work 6am to midnight or later, and come back in at 6am.  I came in at 6:05am one morning due to traffic, and got written up for it.  I learned a lot overall."
good,Great place to start your IT career after college.  As long as you are on a good team that is willing to teach you the Cerner culture you should be fine.
good,I had a great manager that worked with me to expand my position and to become a better worker with more experience in my field. Great benefits and time off opportunities.
good,"The co-workers are great, and stick together. The long days require a lot of commitment from workers, but the one day off a week is nice with at least a 4 day weekend one day a week."
good,"Cerner is a fast growing company in the healthcare IT industry, and it has multiple campuses through out the Kansas City area. Environments of the campuses are modern and huge, making a relaxing and friend working experience."
good,"Cerner is a good place to work. The people and facilities are top notch. I would recommend working there, especially as a first job. There are many training opportunities."
good,"So far, Cerner Corporation has provided a work environment that allows employees with drive to excel and move up the corporate ladder. Training could use some improvement."
good,"Excellent work environment with great people."
good,"Most roles that a person is hired for can be interesting but almost always become very routine and boring. Some roles have a very high level of stress and off-hours required. A lot of people seem happy and content with their position. Though they have a lot of different types of positions, it is very hard to move into them due to how silo-ed you are. You must have/find an advocate that can help you move into a different position. Most management roles are filled with people that were put in them because there seemed to be nowhere else for them to go. Some are good, most seem to have the bare minimum of management training/fortitude to be helpful. You can work hard and do an amazing job (metrics, projects, team work) but it goes mostly unnoticed due to lack of quality management."
good,Great place to learn and gain experience. I would highly recommend any student coming out of college to consider Cerner. They will provide you all the tools necessary to be successful in future endeavorers.
good,"Overall, the experience at Cerner has been great. The workplace is very modern and innovative and the company provides all benefits. It serves as a great starting company for software engineers because of the training and agile software life-cycle. Many teams support ""legacy"" applications, meaning you deal with older code-bases. However, most teams are pushing to use more modern frameworks. Depending on the team you get placed on, the job could be stressful because of hard deadlines. This is mostly due nature of Health IT. At the end of day applications affect a large population, hospital staff, and patients."
good,"work is 8-5, If you get assigned to a project, there are different stages of the key dates of the project. depending on the stage, it can be stressful. You go get to travel, and the per diem is good, but at times you won't have your weekends during those events"
good,Good place to work and a great company to work for with pay and award agreements in place. The most learning and innovative place to work for any new comer.
good,"It's a good place to work, it all depends on where you get placed though. You travel a lot, the work place culture is very relaxed. Expect to work overtime with no extra pay."
good,"good place to work if u want to relax. Good worklife balance. workload is also ok. not too much pressure."
good,I was in a fast paced team environment but there was a good support from team members that could led us to reach our deadlines. It was one of the finest experiences that  I had in my career.
good,"Mostly Depends on Team which you get recruited."
good,"Workstation administration with opportunities for projects and overtime."
good,I really enjoyed Cerner as a whole. My problem was how much individuals were required to work outside of normal hours. This became an on going issue for everyone on my team.
good,"The working hours at Innovation Kids Learning Center were long.  It was a plus that the schedule at the time was 4, 10 hour days and a day off during the week."
good,"The work cannot be planned as the requirements keep changing"
good,"Good company flexible culture"
good,Company is very strict about administrative tasks. salary is just ok and not as good as it could be. There can be a lot of improvement with communication
good,Work was fun but a bit tasking. Supervisors were understanding and helpful. I had a friendly team and meeting deadlines were crucial but possible.
good,Cerner tends to hire fresh college graduates that are top of their class which sets up a culture to have high expectations. Working overtime is expected without pay.
good,The people are great to work with but consultants are given too many projects being over worked.  Need better compensation vs. the expectations that are set
good,"Cerner Corporation is one of the two largest provider of EMRs and healthcare consulting services with global footprint.  Cybersecurity Advisory and Program Management is vendor and product agnostic,"
good,"Awesome experience."
good,Productive work environment. Obtain a lot of knowledge and skills in a short period of time.Fast paced atmosphere. Constant client interaction.
good,Many different areas that can be worked.  Big place with a lot of associates and it is beginning to take on the characteristics of a big company.
good,Cerner corporation is a very good place to learn new technologies and follow development process. The work environment is good and team members are really helpful.
good,"friendly people"
good,"Cerner Corporation is a supplier of health information technology (HIT) solutions, services, devices and hardware. Cerner's world headquarters campus is across the street from North Kansas City Hospital, Cerner's second hospital client."
good,I had a great experience at Cerner all around.  Lots of training opportunities.  Plenty of work challenges.  Excellent people to work with.
good,Cerner Corporation sits at the corner of IT and Healthcare. Cerner is a great place for technical jobs. It is not a great place to start if you are a business major or wish to pursue a career in business. I joined the Operations Academy and was given a technical support role.
good,Cerner is a great place to work especially for new graduates. There is a lot of opportunity to grow within the company and experience many aspects of business. They have a great mission and have a huge impact on healthcare today.
good,"The company and its policy is good but the problem is Managers. All the managers are doing only clerical job, only follows order of onsite team. They don't have guts to discuss any issue onsite team. The company never bothers to collect feed back of Mangers. Managers are always trying to create problem rather than solving employee's problems. "
good,"Cerner is a great company to join as a college graduate. They will bring you in a teach you what you need to succeed. The career families are not clearly defined but there is room to grow your career if you work hard. Great work environment. Provide on site cafeteria, gym and employee clinic including pharmacy."
good,good feedback from maangers ontime and immediate attention from the managers also have a good feedback from the managers
good,Cerner has got one of the best working environments. The management is very supportive and helpful. Apart from my day to day work i had to much fun with the fun activities we use to do at Cerner for example Cricket tournament and football tournaments.
good,Clear deadlines and goals that had to be accomplished for client and for Cerner which was a conflict. I defined my management skills. I enjoyed training staff and sharing my knowledge. I really found that staffing the clinic 24 hours a day was a challenge  and it was really hard to balance company time and family time.
good,"Top line cutting edge technology, they will work you hard"
good,"The start of a career is perfect within Cerner, although your time is going to exclusively be for the company.  Management seems to be in a lax of what to do with their employees and there's a lot of self drive which you need to find what's going on rather than being led and taught."
good,I learned a lot about the transformations taking place in the healthcare industry.
good,"1.	Mail check for any important project related update. "
good,Cerner Corporation is a great place to work. it gives you the opportunity to see and learn new things.
good,Supportive management if working on the right team.  Employees resistant to change.
good,"In most cases, you can't ask for better people to work with, but you will most likely put in some long hours at least a few weeks out of the year if you are in the finance organization."
good,"The culture, benefits, and perks are great. I've met a lot of wonderful, intelligent people."
good,Good experience with good people around. Uses lot of technologies which are in good demand in market but at the same time they have their own technologies which are boring and of no use outside Cerner.
good,"A typical day at work from an interns perspective is to just follow instructions. I learned that technology requires a high level of attention to detail, documentation and previous knowledge in specific areas. My manager tried to convert me to be Mormon when my car broke down and I asked him to pick me up on his way into work. The co-workers that had been at Cerner for a long time are pretty cool for the most part. There are lemons everywhere. The hardest part of the job was seeing all sorts of initiative to be taken but being restricted due to educational requirements. A lot of jobs are very simple at Cerner but like everywhere they are on a strict budget that often overlooks needed assets and unneeded experience. I would work at Cerner again only from an executive standpoint and in the town-hall meetings the executives would exemplify the fact they had been at Cerner, left and then come back. The executives are the only big paying positions available at Cerner contrary to what the reputation is in the Kansas City area. The hardest part of the job for me was doing the job of a software engineer with really 0 experience. I was definitely misplaced in the hiring process. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to Washington, DC to Ft. Belvoir for an operation in the hospital."
good,You get to learn a lot as an engineer both technically as well as team skills.
good,12 hour shifts on weekends are challenging. I love the staff at Cerner except for the computer documentation issues.
good,Strong competitor in IT Healthcare Industry.  Many talented people in the Cerner community.
good,"Satellite of Cerner Corporation basically dealing with outcomes research publications, pharmaceutical/healthcare literature reviews.  This company is based in Kansas City, Missouri and all important information is disseminated through Kansas City.  "
good,"Domain knowledge was very important to work on Application and i learnt  about importance of supply chain in industry."
good,Involved in query resolution using SQL and VBA.Coordinated with US team.
good,I am looking for Analyst roles. I enjoy trouble shooting things and building data for clients
good,"I work with very impressive individuals at Cerner Corporation.  In my role, I perform a wide range of functions, from managing and maintaining system performance on the UNIX and WINDOWS platforms, to running critical incidents to ensure any high impacting issues are resolved quickly and cleanly.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people that I work with an how well we work together."
good,The training was not very good. Had some pretty good co-workers.
good,Great place to get your career started. It's a very large company so if that's something you're looking for you are in the right place.
good,Company is good and helps people learn different technology and being confident to there work. Work life bLance is very good here. Associates are also very helpful.
good,I'll just keep it cute...No comment. It's not bad if you are in population health. Processed claims for a client but due to many leadership changes and communication issues the contract was severed.
good,The only constant at Cerner is change. There are many opportunities to grow and progress your career if you are willing to accept tough challenges and turn problems and issues into a solution. The past 40 years have been an amazing journey and I am excited to see where the next 40 years takes the company.
good,"A typical day at work for me was to get in in the morning and have scrum to see where everybody was at with their tasks then after that a typical day consisted largely of meetings."
good,"My experience varies based on my manager.  I had a great manager at one point and loved it. I also had a difficult manager later on, and hated it.  Overall, it is a good place to work, especially for a younger person looking for room to grow."
good,"I have had both the worst micro-manager and the best leader ever.  The company strives for leadership to have a minimal number of direct reports (8-12).  Pros:  Bi-weekly one on one meetings, constant communication and engagement.  Cons: The need for so many managers results in a lot of inexperienced people being promoted to managers.  On a new team, I have seen several people around me apply and get a leadership position after working for 6 months and no prior management experience.  The need for so many managers lowers the expectations which can potentially have dire consequences on their direct reports.  I have seen a single manager lose 8 people on a team of 10 people in 1.5 years."
good,Worked in Managed Services was able to work independently without micromanagment.  Able to make important decisions locally. Provided needed governance as well as strategic and tactical planning.  Had a very good working relationship with management both inside and outside the organization.
good,What I heard and what I experienced are two totally different worlds. I was hired for a new business venture and a lot of things had  not been flushed out. Some management was good and others had no clue as to what was happening. Very little direction and instruction was provided.
good,"There was no typical day working with Cerner Corporation. We travelled to client sites and performed installations, training, and support for go live conversions."
good,"* travel and work onsite at multiple healthcare facilities with the hospital project team and C-suite implementing the Cerner EHR"
good,"It can be a tough, fast paced place to work but overall the work is very rewarding. Every day there is something new to focus on, change is a constant."
good,"It is what you make of it. Come in and work hard and you'll do ok. Some departments are not good at advancing, but you do have the opportunity to change roles after an allotted period of time."
good,"On going learning environment, with a wide open place to learn. The Cerner team associates leads with open arms and doors for learning. The atmosphere here is welcoming and peaceful."
good,"If you consistently show you're adding value, you'll be rewarded and given good autonomy to make a difference. The company and its highest performers are driven, and the success of Cerner is a testament to holding folks accountable."
good,"If you want to work in Healthcare IT, Cerner Healthcare is a great place to work.  Cerner is on the bleeding edge of Healthcare IT innovation, and is committed to doing its part to make the delivery of quality healthcare by providers as easy as possible by giving those providers the tools they need to be successful."
good,i received a lot of beneficial experience while working for cerner.  i take quite a few phone calls and attempt to fix all issues as the come in to the best of my ability .
good,"You have job security and a high chance of getting promotion in the long term since the company is expanding very quickly. However, the pay is below average and you are expected to work more than 40 hours a week."
good,"They almost pride themselves in not being the highest paying company, despite me working 50+ hours some weeks. "
good,"For the most  part, Cerner is a good place to work.  It is pretty laid back for the most part as both c"
good,Good people for the most part. Having a good manager is a must. Work can be interesting and usually is but can also include some mind numbing tasks. Overall a good company.
good,"Its about who you know and landing the job that really suits you. Its great if your team as reasonable hours but if not its just grind it out time until you can hopefully change positions,"
good,I worked at Cerner for 4.5 Years and It was fun to work. You get lot of learning. You are allowed to experiment and make decisions if you can prove your point. You can learn a lot of things as training keeps on happening. Lot of employee and culture improvement training.
good,"Cerner is a great company to begin your career. Cerner has a friendly, diverse, relaxed culture with ample opportunity for advancement."
good,"Working as a Medical Billing Specialist was a very enjoyable job at Cerner. If you haven't used their system in the past, it is difficult to learn but once you get the hang of it it becomes second nature. The management at the Minneapolis location are great to work with."
good,"Cerner is a good place to work in terms of IT and Healthcare.  The issue is they live by ""work hard/play hard"" to an extreme.  Management can allow you to sink or swim on your own.  There is often a lot of travel involved in the positions but you do get to keep any benefits and often they are able to let you truly know the needs of the hospital."
good,Have learned much in many different technologies.  Many that are new and upcoming that I was not taught at university.  Can be quite a time demand as many times have had to work from home in the evenings.  Workplace is fun and provides many benefits for their associates.
good,"Most of the workforce is young. This means if you are a new recruit then there are plenty of friends to be made. "
good,"I enjoyed consulting at Cerner, but only because I was single and enjoyed travel. Hours are demanding, and the work culture makes it difficult to maintain a work/life balance. Most of my coworkers were young (millennials). There are quite a bit of employee benefits, including a oncampus nurse office and childcare options."
good,"Day @ cerner starts with the agile scrum meeting where the lead takes the update of the previous days work and present days work plan."
good,Meeting new people on every project is great.  Traveling around the country for the company is awesome.Every project is something new and exciting.
good,The PTO policy sucks. Not much vacation. It is hard to move on to different higher profile positions.I learned a lot though being here and still learning new things everyday. The location Kansas City sucks and the environment in this place is going to make lonely all the time plus no vacation means being here is like you are exactly in a jail. Nothing new to see in this city
good,A typical day includes emails and meetings and some system build and trouble shooting.  Co Workers are alright but upper management doesn't have a clue. They have no respect for work/life balance. But its a good job with decent benefits and job security.  The most satisfying part of my job is fixing an issue a client was having and making them happy or building something just that makes their job easier.
good,My last 10 years with Cerner has been enjoyable to say the least.  The employees (associates) are top-notch and function in a team environment.
good,"Strong focus on younger talent, passion for driving client results and business outcomes.  Organization mobilized around developing solution sets to address customer needs while achieve desired patient outcomes."
good,"Having a great time Cerner, now I feel its time to move on."
good,"a feel good place to work , but again it all depends on the team your in and the manager."
good,"During my internship i worked on servers and its middleware.While i was working as an software developer i worked on cerner applications which involves working on java,VC++,VB and backend scripts."
good,"Good Company , Many Opportunities, Growth is abundant and everyone is very pleasant."
good,"Travel almost every week to different client sites.  I learned about consultative partnering, influence model, all the different solutions at Cerner EHR, all aspects of Meaningful Use and ICD-10.  As Clinical Strategist we typically worked directly with the clients and more project management and change management.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get the client to move forward with change management and follow a standardized model.  I do enjoy working with all the different team members involved in a project for Cerner and enjoyed building relationships with the clients and seeing a successful conversion."
good,"Typically a day at work can go from quiet to total caos.  For example you may have a simple paper cut or an employee may suffer life threating injuries onsite."
good,"Pay is average if not below similar roles"
good,"Enjoyed working with the other consultants. Management was quick to praise for work that was completed on-time, on-budget. Working with the client base was the best part of the job."
good,A typical day something different each day. You will research a denied claim for payment.  Calling insurance payers finding out what is needed to get claim paid. Filing appeals for reconsideration.
good,"Good place to work if you get a good team and manager."
good,Cerner has been good to me for the last 12 years.  The company has treated me fairly and allowed me to excel.  I've had new opportunities and been paid well.
good,"The training and onboarding is great for entry level candidates. You learn a lot, but there is a lot of collaboration/training, so you don't feel overwhelmed. The company is pretty relaxed considering how large they are, but annual raises are small and it is more difficult to advance than what they tell you when you interview/start the job. Lately, there have been layoffs at random."
good,Cerner has given me lots of opportunities to learn and travel to client sites. It's a trial by fire environment which helps weed people out and bring out the top performers. Unfortunately compensation lags others in the industry and the company is happy to replace you with someone fresh out of college they can pay less.
good,"Cerner allows for an equal work/life balance, the ability to work virtually for some positions."
good,"Great company for someone starting out in thier career after college.  The work-life balance can be improved upon; however, great company!   The traveling was fun for me."
good,"When you work at Cerner, you work hard. Sometime long hours, long weeks, but there is always a positive side, if you look for it. You can play hard (vacations, flexible hours, free gym on campus, etc) if you work hard."
good,"I enjoy working for Cerner.  Great benefits, the pay is good and as long as you find the perfect team, you will love it!  The great thing about Cerner is the ability to transfer within the company to find that perfect team!"
good,"-my day to day activities include extensive email communication. Coordinating over 60 events at one time. "
good,I love the people I work with and I have the perfect work life balance but I am needing something new. Looking for that next step in my career.  I want something that is challenging and can expand my skills.
good,Cerner is in the process of making many changes to the culture and the business tools and  practices. Changes are going fast and often. You just have to keep up
good,A typical say at work would be coming into the office and taking a look what is on the agenda for the day. This is constantly changing due to different aspects of the systems. The workplace culture is very relaxed if you get your work down. Great people and have made life long friends from here.
good,"I have limited experience, but I think that Cerner strenth is in empowerment of the employees to affect change.  I like that the employees have autonomy, but in some cases the push to 'allow' staff to self advance sometimes makes the employee feel like they are forced to do a lot of research.  This can waste the time of the employee.  I think that if the company wants staff to better further direct themselves that they need to make the tools to do their job easier.  If the employee is very self motivated, they will do well."
good,"Cerner is a good company to work for. There are numerous learning and advancement opportunities if one wishes. However, many require 24 hour a day on-call for clients."
good,"Before entering a proper team you'll be in dev center, which will give you mentors to provide feedback for your code. The assessment of these mentors will have a large impact on whether you get placed on a team or get fired, if you're unlucky then your mentor will be strict with their assessments, which can get you booted while other more lenient mentors will let people move onto teams. If you get a harsh mentor you'll have to accept that you'll need to work harder than others just to avoid getting fired."
good,"Lots of opportunities to do meaningful work right from the start"
good,"Great company, but may not be the right fit for everyone who applies for a position. Lots of travel. Long hours for salaried  work workers. Challenging environment which may be good for those thrive on that sort of environment. Hardest part of the job is moving up the ranks. Most enjoyable is working with folks of varied skill sets and background."
good,"Cerner Corporation is a varied and stimulating environment to work in which is also something that makes it a challenging place to work. While there is some support for work-life balance, the emphasis is generally one where the more hours you work, the more you expected to continue and expand."
good,"The Cerner culture is definitely pushed at the Columbia campus which is completely independent from the KC campuses but not really."
good,Pretty things to learn and a highly professional work culture that i have seen in my 4 yrs of experience. Good company for the freshers who start their careers
good,"My day consists of putting out a lot of fires, however, that is not the whole day. As leaders and management it is our job to put out fires. I get a great feeling of accomplishment for the work we do here and the accomplishments we've made."
good,"Good place to begin your career, the training is very good and they make sure you have the tools needed before they actually give you real work, work then kicks up and get ready to work some hours."
good,"Ii is a great place to learn.  Even though  they are bit strict on how do things, you are exposed to so many technologies and based on how they operate you learn the basics from which you build your skill set."
good,"Good place if you want a brief experience, however, in case you expect thrill you may want to choose a different place. The worst thing is that there's no interaction at all among employees"
good,"Good company, great benefits, not micro-managed.  Good salary for people coming out of college.  Sometimes the traveling every week can be a bit much, but you get points for hotel/flights."
good,I learned that the longer you work at Cerner the more stressful and work they throw at you. While you may travel for weeks on end the weeks you do not travel your day consists of an 8 hour office job.
good,Good place to work and learn at the same time. Learn new technologies and explore knowledge. Decisions can be taken by self. Minimal dependencies. Overall a good company having work ethics.
good,"Good place to work for fresher's, lot of scope to learn different technologies,explore skills and implement."
good,"Good people, good compensation and a tremendous sense of success when job is done within targets, timetable and budget.  "
good,"Working here has truly been an experience. Being able to work at a company as big as this one allows you to seize opportunities to help yourself develop and truly understand the healthcare IT industry. You can definitely make your way up the corporate ladder if you put in the work. My main concern is with the work/life balance. The added on responsibility with traveling makes it so that you can easily work +60 hour weeks for some people. Burnout is a big reason why there's also frequent turnover at times. However, there are people who have worked years at this company and it is possible to manage it all."
good,"I've been at Cerner a long time and have had many great experiences. I've reached a point in my life where I am tired of the fast-paced, ever changing, demanding environment and planning to move no to something else. Great place to start a career."
good,"I am currently working as Senior Test Analyst involves testing Health care billing application (Patient Accounting).I have enhanced my SQL skills working at Cerner."
good,"I was a contract employee working through Holland Square Group, I was not an actual employee of Cerner. Work was contracted."
good,"Cerner is the best company to work for straight out of college. Depending on the organization you belong to, you may burnout quickly. One can learn a lot by starting their career at Cerner"
good,There are many areas that you can advance to and in most areas training was done very well. At some points training was not available due to time restrictions of other so to give your best is all you can do.
good,"business friendly work culture"
good,"Good Place to work as a Fresher. Work and personal life is balanced. Good Company to start as a fresher with good pay."
good,"Provide small to medium private practices with practice management and EMR solutions, services, and hardware to meet business needs across various platforms.  On a daily basis I would provide remote technical support and assistance to customers and Vitalworks\Cerner service personnel in the installation and utilization of healthcare software, hardware, and business applications."
good,"A typical day at work including managing service queue for several remote clients. These clients aere all healthcare facilities in the north Atlantic region. My day would consist of updating my service queues with investigation and transference to specialized teams, all while managing projects including upgrades and domain maintenance. I learned several personal / professional skills, as well as many backend based skills within Linux, AIX, and HPUX. Management was helpful, and encouraging. MY coworkers were very motivated and encouraged me to push myself and take on new tasks. The most difficult part of the job was balancing out live, production work, with long-term project based work. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new tips and tricks and being able to apply them on a daily basis to improve customer satisfaction."
good,Productive work environment. The most enjoyable part was working alongside of my colleagues and learning from them. There is a lot of variety in the day to day work i get . Very less of monotony
good,"Cerner is a great place to start your career, the people are friendly and helpful. As far a moving up in the company it's kind of hard."
good,Very young company!  Lots of fresh ideas - smart people too.  Great management.  I love working for the Cerner Coporation.  Leaders of HIT
good,"The life of a Cerner Consultant can really vary depending on what solution team and clients you are placed on. There is a lot of valuable experience to be gained, such as traveling and working face to face with clients. Overall, the company is very young and creates a competitive and interactive work environment. They offer great benefits and opportunities for advancement and transitioning between roles."
good,"work about 10 or more hours per day"
good,"Productive and very flexible work place, and lots of learning."
good,Working on a complex issue where whole team is divided into 2 groups and the team which solves the issue get compensatory off for a day.
good,The environment in Cerner is very light and open. Seniors are always ready to help you out and it doesn't matter to which team you belong. I was in the Upgrade Centre team and the working culture was very helpful and light. Late working hours are not encouraged in this team but if the need arises people do stay back. Complete your Webinars and all the Knowledge Transfers very seriously as they will be helping you in your work ahead and moreover they will make you clearly understand the structure of work in Cerner. Time and again these KTs will be conducted as per the need.
good,"Pros"
good,"Coming out of college, Cerner was a great place to start.  You get exposed to very complex situations and are put into decision-making positions not available to most professionals until 5 years+ into their careers.  I've really enjoyed my direct managers and department leadership; less so the executive and C-Suite leadership."
good,"Cerner healthcare solution private limited, is a good company for freshers and good packages for the freshers are also better than rest in the market."
good,Client facing role on the road 4 days a week most weeks.  Cerner is a progressive company where the role changes and support is available.  Pay was good.
good,Great place to start your career in the training programs. Compensation could be more competitive. Your experience really depends on what organization you are part of.
good,"Good company for which to work, however, upper management is unavailable in person; most communication is via email and phone, which can be colossally inconvenient when problems arise and help is required.  Mostly, my jobs allowed complete autonomy, which was wonderful, but when regional management came for audits, we'd get blasted because for 6 months we operated in a vacuum. months we received little or no direction regarding the requirements"
good,"typical workday: productive"
good,"Cerner is a great learning experience for medical billing, enjoyed the teamwork and fellow employees are very helpful in training and maintaining all the changes that  come with medical billing industry."
good,Cerner is a great company for newly graduated people. it is a great place to start your career and learn new skills.  If you live in Kansas City or nearby it is a great company to grow your career.   Opportunities to advance are available as well as training and education .
good,"This is a great first job out of college, and if you work hard, they typically promote from within. The work life balance can be hard to achieve but your team usually makes it worth it!"
good,"Cerner Corporation offers a comfortable work environment which allows employees to feel a sense of a laid back workplace. "
good,"Job can be intense.  Always an opportunity to learn. Career growth is encouraged.  The days can be very long.  "
good,"The environment is very uplifting in the Bangalore office, due to the young crowd. A lot of fun activities like a hackathon, DevCon, Sports Day happen here. Overall fun environment."
good,"While working in Hanford, it was a great place to work high expectations and teamwork oriented. I was exposed to a lot of management growth opportunities."
good,RevWorks is not aligned with true Cerner culture. The Management in the SSC has no regard for Cerner culture or work life and does not respect associates who've been with the company much longer than them.
good,This is a good company with room for growth. When it come to feeling good about your role/job it depends on the team. Some teams have more of a family vibe while others have bad chemistry. This can be a huge factor when it comes to job productivity. I have noticed in the past the teams with a more corporate focus have more team conflicts. Another contributing factor could be the misplaced direction of some roles such as Test Analyst.
good,"Working for Cerner has been a huge learning experience due to Cerner being a global company.  I have been given very good training for my position that has come in handy in many aspects of my life and for that, I am truly appreciative"
good,"Company is great to work for and enjoyed what I did, but couldn't handle all of the travel. The travels did allow you to go places you may have never been, occasional travel would have been ideal, just not every week."
good,At Cerner I had a good experience and got to learn about the health sector and how it functions. The environment was fun and hospitable too. The management was very encouraging towards new things. The most enjoyable part of the job was handling data and learning from it.
good,Good place to be in the advancement of Medical software and be the in the forefront of change. A company that is very forward thinking and is a big player in the changes coming in the medical field.
good,"Cerner is a great place for recent college grads to start their careers. There are numerous rolls to be had and you don't really know what you'll be doing until you start working there, due to the academy system in place."
good,"Cerner is a good place to start your career but it's easy to get pigeon-holed into one role. Negotiate your salary if offered because once you have it, that's what's locked in and raises will only be given as a percentage of that."
good,Hard work with little compensation but resources available to help you succeed. high turnover rate resulting in constant training and catching up. No bonuses
good,"No true structure for employee onboarding for IT works sites. if you work in Kansas City or as a consultant, there is a better structure for acclimating you to the organization and building your skill. So you need to be highly motivated"
good,Culture varies widely between teams. Good teams are great and bad teams are especially overworked or communicate badly. Some managers do reward dedication and commitment.
good,Progressive company with very good approach. It tries to serve its client to the fullest. They believe in ensuring uninterrupted support to the client . Employees are looked after and are well compensated. Lot to learn about the corporate and healthcare as a whole.
good,Worked an assignment at the Cerner Corp which was a fun work place. They are a very employee friendly company with a great atmosphere. They encourage the employees.
good,Great place to work if you are offered adequate money. Tends to be below market average dont expect large raises. Its the perfect place to work for culture.
good,It was a bit difficult to deal with the fast pace of the company and the work/life ratio was a little bad sometimes. But overall it's a great company if you are able to accomplish your goals within.
good,Healthcare master is cerner. Great company to learn healthcare domain and good work life balance.A place you can enjoy and learn together as a family.
good,"I wish management was more communicative in how we can advance our careers and what our next steps are, but besides that it is a great company to learn the software with. I am enjoying my experience."
good,"Work/life balance can be manageable depending on where you are in the company.  My position is a set 9-5 position and I normally do not take work home with me when I leave.  The hardest part of the job is the high turnover rate in my area.  We are constantly losing and training new people. It's a great way to jump start your career if you are just starting out.  Fun, fast-paced environment."
good,Cerner is a great company to work for from a professional development perspective. Management opportunities are provided at very early stages in the career. Work life balance and benefits are lacking.
good,"It's very easy to be overlooked as you are a dime a dozen. Managers move quick as I have had 6 leads in 2 years. Managers don't know strengths of the team nor do some care, they simply want the numbers. Great experience out of college but majority move on as you have to play politics if you want to advance in Cerner."
good,"Like most corporations. There's both the good and bad. You can make it work. As a DBA it's work work work. then you go home and do some more work. Good managers are great to work with, but there a great desire to grow the company and I feel it's already too big. I feel that desire to grow the company is displacing ""care"" for the employees."
good,"This was a good place to work, with fine management and great co-workers. They employed best coding practices, enforced good documentation from everybody, required unit testing, and had great domain experts (including a graphics artist) available to us. I enjoyed my time at Cerner except they first promised to extend our contracts, but at the last minute (just before Christmas) decided to dump all contractors."
good,Cerner is a great cooperation to work for! I have met a lot of good people as well as worked with them. The team unity within Cerner is a great experience and the collaboration between associates is never ending. We want to do nothing but better the Healthcare experience. I highly recommend Cerner if you are looking for the Cooperation work force.
good,"Barely two weeks old in the UAE and I found myself landing a job as admin/receptionist in Abu Dhabi. While it was a temporary role, I was thankful for the opportunity to work at Cerner. The people were nice, some of them were really friendly and encouraging. It kind of helped me take my mind off home and homesickness was not as bad as I thought, as I had some things to think of and learn."
good,"Cerner is a great place to work for. They have always projects lined up and the work is exciting as well. Technology is a concern often times because of latency, however, there are tech uplift happening in pockets and will take couple of years to migrate."
good,"Located at GTP & MTP in Bangalore, its now 2 years since Cerner took over Siemens Health Care. Work likfe balance is good, opportunity to grow internally is average while job security is better than most of the other companies."
good,I had an opportunity to work on various teams and in various roles. Great learning experience. Great co-workers. Some great managers some not as good.
good,I've had 2 great managers. Good stable company. Good benefits as long as you use the Cerner Clinic.Must be willing to work hard. Ok salary for fresh out of college applicants. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement to other departments if in IT Works Department and  Help Desk.
good,"I enjoy working as a consultant, I have been doing this for year now and i enjoy every single part of the job. Working as EPIC?CERNER consultant has also give hun"
good,Average work week was 40-45 hours.  I learned unit testing and how to develop code on a team using an agile approach.  Good mentor-ship from senior developers and fun atmosphere.  Hardest part of the job was meeting managers vague standards.
good,"Cerner is a different kind of IT company, one that places healthcare and patient care at its forefront. Everything we do is for the betterment of patient care and to make physician's lives easier through IT solutions."
good,"Cerner has agile engineering teams working on many solutions utilizing dozens of technologies such as VC++, C#, JAVA, SQL."
good,"Cerner Corporation is perfect for new, driven associates with flexible goals and life needs. They ask a lot but your work pays dividends."
good,Lots of opportunities.  Some organizations provide for better advancement and pay opportunities.  Overall lots of opportunity and a good place to start career.
good,You can work really hard and get the opportunity to move up but only after a certain amount of years you have worked there
good,"Good stable company. Some really good management, some really bad management. Your experience will vary wildly based on the team you're on."
good,"Consult and support healthcare organizations implementing, refining, leveraging and operating advanced technology solutions."
good,"Cerner puts a lot of emphasis on working very efficiently and being very productive.  In the area I worked in, it was very much work hard, play hard.  People on my team seem to do well on 40-50 hours if they are very productive in those hours.  It should be noted though that these hours are very high pressure and stressful in the role I am in.  We have more metrics than can be focused on, some of which are said but then end up getting flat out ignored.  If you don't defend yourself here, it is possible that your good work ethic and accomplishments could be overlooked.  In my second-hand experience, Friends of mine in development seemed to me to be overworked.  I can point to specific people that worked a minimum of 60 hrs per week and pulled several (3 or more) 80 hour weeks.  My experience of managers is that they are generally very understanding and reasonable, here.  They work with you to get you to where you want to be and can excel."
good,I've worked here for 2 years now and really enjoy my job. Some days can be stressful but nothing like working at the bedside as an RN. The people I work with have become friends outside of work as well.
good,"Culture was great while I was with the company. The company is committed to changing healthcare. However, since leaving, it is clear many of the benefits / compensation is lagging behind competitors or similar type roles."
good,"Good place to start a career. Good work life balance. Good pay for freshers. "
good,Good organization to work in. More dependent on US headquarter and decisions from there. India center is more of an execution center. There are huge learning scope for few roles.
good,I have learned a ton at Cerner the past 15+ years.  Most of the managers I had were extremely helpful and great.  I had the opportunity to try different positions in different organizations within the company.  This provided me a way to grow my Cerner knowledge and find the best role fit for me.
good,"Thankful that they offered me a job straight out of college. However, after seeing what compensation was for a DBA at other companies. I knew I it was time to move on. The culture is great and I had great mentors."
good,The company values their on their company policy. Typical day at work includes being at work 15 min early and settling down and getting on the phone. The culture of the workplace is great and very accepting.
good,"A typical day for me was started in a circle where we talked about what tickets we were working on in front of the team. Then we go off and work on what we have and floated around asking each other for help, got on calls, I had a hands off boss that only directed when needed and things are pretty well delegated out. "
good,"Working at Cerner is definitely not bad.  The work can be mildly repetitive and you can get burned out, but they do let you change positions after 18 months.  The pay is not great though.  They do have an awesome gym, onsite doctors/pharmacy, and the new campus has two arcades and libraries though.  A lot of support teams do have an on call phone that rotates between members, which you can get called on at anytime and have to answer and solve client issues."
good,"Cerner Corporation is an innovative company, always looking for the now and next in health care IT. The autonomy provided to associates facilitates great opportunities for personal growth."
good,Cerner is a great place to gain experience.  Offering cross training is there if you are willing to work the extra hours.  Traveling 80-100% of the time is a struggle when trying to have a balance between work and life.  Many employees leave because of the demanding schedule does not leave much time for a family life.
good,"Cerner is a great company with a focused vision for the future of healthcare to benefit both its clients and the patients they serve. This is a good company at which to start your career. There is a bit of a gap between junior employees and senior management. There is room for advancement and competition for such advancement is strong due to the limited number of positions. As there have been several voluntary separation packages offered by Cerner over the past few years, this may have created more space for employees to experience growth in their career. Cerner tends to hire directly from college for many of its positions, which helps them keep talent costs low. Experienced candidates may find trouble being considered for some positions. Cerner tends to offer lower pay for many positions relative to competitors in the industry, so long-tenured associates are likely to be a thing of the past."
good,Good Work-Life Balance. Work from home available. Will get good exposure in the healthcare domain. Health programs run in the organization for the benefit of employees.  In-house health club for the benefit of employees. Good Salaries.
good,Great company to work for in Kansas City as long as you are dedicated and can manage time well. I enjoyed the people that I worked with. The software is very outdated and would require minimal learning usage.
good,"Cerner gives its employees a good work life balance and at the same time gives ample opportunities to learn. Learning opportunities depends on team you are working with. If you are working the teams developing prosperity software , learning could be restricted."
good,"There's not a lot of micro-management, so it's a pretty relaxed working environment. I was able to get the skills of all areas of IT, including Networking/Programming/Server administration. Managers are hit or miss, most are pretty good, some are walkovers who say yes to their bosses without understanding the impact it will have on their team's workload. Average age of employees is pretty young in the KC area, and it's easy to get along with most. There will be weeks where you will have very little to do and a lot of downtime, and there will be weeks where you will have to put in 50-70 hours if things are in a time crunch. Both are rare, but they do happen."
good,"This job is listed as Cerner but this is Carolinas healthcare system. Busy workplace, easy work environment with peers.. Feel appreciated. Access to benefits and free health screenings with fitness classes."
good,"Easy requirements for freshers. Help available all around. Good pay, Advancement. Good location. Weekly outings. Manager is good. Nothing much to say."
good,"Cerner provides a lot of opportunities for advancement which will help individuals grow. They provide numerous benefits and have a bright future. You may work long hours depending on your role, but being salaried that comes with the territory."
good,"Generally I arrived at 12 and worked till 3, the internship was only for half of the school day. I worked with my team on fixes to the code and websites. It was fulfilling work and the people were friendly."
good,Growing company with great opportunities if you're a recent college graduate. You're going to work a lot but also learn a develop professional skills.
good,I think Cerner is an excellent way to start a career. They are fair with entry level compensation but do not always allow for upward mobility. I would recommend Cerner.
good,Cerner is a great place to work directly out of college. It throws you in a fast paced environment forces you to grow professionally in ways that you didn't even know you needed to grow.
good,"Cerner is a great place to work if you start working there in the field that you'd like to stay in. If you start out with something else just to get your foot in the door, it can hamper your future salary and advancement opportunities."
good,If you are a developer looking to kickstart your software career in a great city with good cost of living Cerner is the place for you.  It is very large and there is a lot of work going on and a lot of no work.
good,"Cerner is a great company, you will work hard but it has afforded me many opportunities.  Forty-hour work weeks aren't the norm, but if that doesn't concern you and you have honed multi-tasking skills, coupled with strong work ethic, it may be a great fit."
good,"We can balance the professional and personal life. cool environment."
good,"Worked as consultant."
good,Perfect fit for the right out of college person to grow and come into their own. Will make you understand the business world more. Pay structure could always be greater.
good,Good and helpful colleagues to work with. Challenging work environment always makes you a learn new technologies. Plenty of room and opportunity to improve your skills. Company also provides great tools like pluralsight to catch up with the always changing technology. My input was always valued in my team and appreciated.
good,"I only worked for Cerner a short time. Cerner acquired a start up company I had been working at for 5+ years - the start up was the best job I've ever had. As a consultant, we brought a new product to market - in doing so, we worked all aspects of product development, testing, implementation, methodology development, etc. The best clinician colleagues I've ever worked with. Cerner inherited a group of consultants that were not the best fit for their methodology at the time. It was a challenging transition."
good,"Cerner Health Services is Great and Fun to work , I learned SOA12c and Health care domain knowledge. very friendly co-workers , good management, Great learning curve."
good,The company is working hard to make healthcare better for everyone. The management is very dedicated to making IT a way to improve the quality of healthcare.
good,"Provides a nice start for beginners and does not overburden right away with complex task. Have a very competitive environment and can get busy with experience. Have a very healthy work culture, Managers support in time of difficulties"
good,"This was an incredible opportunity to gain experience, and be handed a large amount of responsibility at a young age. Working here will definitely put you in a position to make a lot more money at your next place of employment. They promote (usually) based on merit/skill so management is typically solid. Downsides usually involve the work/life balance or travel expectations, but, if you're just out of college, being given that opportunity is something that I really appreciated. Another major downside is that so many projects end in dissatisfaction for clients, a lot of that has to do with the nature of the industry, but the desire to keep pushing out new code/design standards without adequate associate education causes problems. I've since left Cerner but really do have a strong appreciation for their flexibility and creativity, you'll make more money elsewhere, but it's likely that your next job won't move nearly as quickly and your opportunities for growth and advancement will adjust to a more normalized pace."
good,"Very long days mandatory, must be willing to travel often, work life balance very difficult. Can be mentaly draining if you are not use to it."
good,I learnt many things as a team. We used to spend most of the time in giving quality on products and efficiency on the task. It was very good support from the seniors to learn the domain and functionality of the Millennium Suite. Even though I was there for short period learnt lot many things. Enjoyed a loot in work place.
good,"Early in the morning at work,I check if databases are running (by using a shell scripts that check all instances )"
good,Good place to start a career. You are able to move around the company to explore other career interests within the company.
good,"Great people to work with who will help you. Living in Kansas City can be challenging if you are from the coasts. "
good,"a nice place to start your career."
good,Using technical troubleshooting skills and EMR application knowledge to improve the clinical workplace. Associates from within the team and outside teams are welcoming to collaborate to resolve technical issues. All involved parties learn something new from the group investigation.
good,"Fast paced, day at work, Learned technology., flexible management, travel, co-workers"
good,"Cerner expects hard workers to perform their tasks without complaint. There are a lot of benefits to performing your job correctly, and lazy workers will get asked to change their routine to include actually working. The duties are challenging at first, and then become routine."
good,I enjoyed my 7 years at Cerner.  I learned more in 7 years there than in all my previous time in the workforce.
good,"A typical day consisted of coming to work between 7-10 and leaving around 5-8. Go to personal cube and work on assigned project with daily meetings with team members. Management was great, they were very helpful when needed. The hardest part was getting access to software that needed authorization. The most enjoyable part was intern events and assigned projects."
good,I loved my role here and learned an amazing amount every day. I enjoyed all my clients and being able to create experiences.
good,We follow Agile methodology as our software development methodology. The day starts with a scrum meeting of about 30 minutes where every one reports their task updates and what they planned for the day.
good,"Typically work week is 60 hrs plus. Learned a Electronic Medical Record system to facilitate patient care. Managers are ""hands off"" and available to give direction and assistance if needed. Depending on where you work, you may or may not see your co-workers. Hardest part of the job is learning the CERNER culture. The most enjoyable was having the freedom to grow and learn new things in an enviroment that encourage you to do so."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with but couldn't take the travel so much as I was settling down. You learn a lot of hands on experience pretty quickly, however there is a lot to learn and you feel like you can never know it all. There are good perks to traveling, but it can be difficult if you are not single."
good,"Coming from Sprint, I most appreciate the culture at Cerner. It's a younger workforce, and from the very beginning, in the hiring process, they make you feel like a person rather than a position."

good,"I am currently employed with Cerner as a Solution Analyst, and I have to say, it has been a challenging job. I have learned a lot, and still continue to learn every day. While a mainly independent job, I feel it requires a lot of communication within your team as well as with other Solution Analysts, Help Desk Associates, IA's, EL's etc. You have many different resources to help you along your solutions. As long as you're willing to keep up with fast paced work and a lot of information at once, you're going to enjoy the work!

Those who work there have been doing so for quite a while and are willing to teach newer associates if they are willing to learn.   Learning the company can be a little difficult, especially as a new associate out of school.  Since many employees have been there for so long, at times it can be hard for them to bring the information down to an understandable level for someone new.

At every campus other than Oaks, there is a sense of creativity and fun as you work closely with your teammates to provide service to your clients.  Oaks (Medical Billing) however, is the polar opposite of most other departments.  Rigid productivity guidelines and very little flexibility exist in that department."

Some teams have a higher workload than others and might require overtime to keep up with the demand but overall the Engineering and CernerWorks organizations are good ones to work for. The culture in these organizations is pretty laid back and depending on your location you can wear shorts to work everyday.
