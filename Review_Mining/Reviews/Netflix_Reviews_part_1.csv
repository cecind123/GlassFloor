rating,review
bad,Netflix was a horrible place to work. You had to bid for your schedule like at an auction and the schedules were horrible as well. The management was horrible. Everything about it was horrible and I would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"Well a typical day at Netflix, Just answering call after call. Mostly old people that can't figure out Netflix or understand that their internet is not working or too slow for Netflix to work correctly. Can't just tell them its not us. Netflix works fine its just like an app. If it works on your phone or for your neighbor then Netflix is working. Your internet isn't. So pretty much what will happen is you will get yelled at and blamed and cussed out because people are so dumb. Working at Netflix itself is fine, but that won't happen anymore because they sold the company to 24/7 wanna be teleperformance. No benefits and insurance will be insane.. Good luck if you apply."
bad,"I hate that I still subscribe to their service, but there's really no other options out there. I hated working there. It was soul sucking. You were penalized for the most mild mishap, even those completely out of your control."
bad,"Terrible place to work and very fire happy even on first offence. They care way to much about the stats then the employee. And because its ""netflix"" they just fire you for whatever. Its a huge revolving door. Plus your job consists of 8 hours a day, helping stupid people find the sign in button. No im not joking about that. Its about 85% of your day."
bad,"This company is a joke. I was cornered and more or less pressured to quit due to a chronic illness. When it was promised I was eligible for rehire, I thought they would stick to it. Even though the previous experience was awful, I thought the pay would be worth going back to. I reapplied once I was in better health, and got a call. Not only did they not look at my resume, I had to explain to them I actually had worked there before. The recruiter then stopped asking questions and said ""well then you know all of this already"". Against better judgement, I believed him when he said I'd get a call back to set up an interview, they were excited at the prospect of having me back. It's been almost a month. Not a single call or email. THIS IS JUST THE HIRING PROCESS. It only gets worse once you get hired. The training is absolutely worthless. When I originally trained, they told us that the floor was totally different, and not to worry about what we learned in the classroom. Management played favorites. Gaining and losing advancement opportunities became personal. If anyone complained about a favored person or procedure, suddenly they were gone and ""no longer a social fit for the company"". They used harsh critique and peer pressure, warped the rules to keep or cut employees. Perks were slowly being removed and policies were being changed so often we couldn't keep up. When confronted about the lack of perks or incentive, management told us that getting paid should be enough. They don't care about their employees, but they also don't care about the customer. Half of the time we would send"
bad,"Far away from working at this place. Nwetflix has a culture of fear and loathing. Unrealistic expectations on goals and i have no clue as to what, if any, manager trainee program they have but the way that they act reminds me of postal supervisors."
bad,"I have worked here about 2 months and have been discriminated against and retaliated against! I have witnessed first hand HORRIBLE customer service and a unsafe, uncomfortable environment, stressful to work in"
bad,Honestly more serious about their customers than they are about their employees.  You don't exist unless something is donev incorrectly.  There are small chances of advancement but not much. The pay is no where close to what it needs to be for their positions.
bad,"everyday was good to me I didn't have any problem working in hear. I learned a lot from this place and management was really nice to me and coworkers. With all my coworkers  I never had any issues, but the hardest part was pushing all the heavy carts."
bad,they do not care about their people. everyone in there smokes pot not professional
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. I would not recommend it to ANYONE."
bad,SAD that such a well known company does so little for its employees.
bad,"You get insulted by customers on the daily, tons of clients complaining about their accounts being overdrafted. Management is ridiculous, employees do not get drug tested or background check. Resulting in manager getting fired from smoking pot and drinking while on the job along with other members of managment. Team is seriously a joke, its like a zoo no structure what so ever. Hours are horrible, you will have to work every single holiday and weekend. Honestly the worst job I have ever had in my life. If you can be constantly happy and not let clients insulting you and screaming at you effect you go for it! Otherwise look else where not worth drivng through the traffic or 10$ per hr!!!!"
bad,"Go in sit for tree hours at a time checking dvd's for scratches and defects. I learned how to look for bad dvd's, I did not work there for that long so I didn't meet to many people."
bad,"the work is fine but they pay very little for the clean and there are not so many venues or days paid for the holidays, and is removed from where I live and there is no transport to San Jose is far away"
bad,"It was less then enjoyable. Management would promise change, and that would happen for about 2 weeks then back to the old song and dance. People bail this job like rats on a sinking ship."
bad,"Brutal environment, literally expected to not make a mistake in training or summarily terminated. Co workers just vanish, never to be seen again. Company presents a happy ""we don't believe in numbers"" image yet in 16 years of working in call centers have the most intensely metric driven performance I've yet to see. Only 5% of new hires are expected to last for a full year, I made it to nine months before landing a less insane job elsewhere. Also, the customers are easily the craziest, most belligerent social engineers I've ever dealt with. In short, it was a nightmare for me."
bad,"pesima administracion, un callcenter mas si no es que de los peores."
bad,"The job started as one of the best jobs I ever had, but over the years all the fun things they used to do to keep up Morale dwindled and eventually stopped completely.  It eventually got to the point where even though we were the best customer service call center every month running for two years straight they closed us down."
bad,"In the training they make it seem like numbers don't matter, but when you get out of it that's all that matters. The managers don't do anything and just critique you without helping you. I would not recommend this job to anyone. The pay is good but you are dealing angry customers who give you bad reviews that hurt you performance. Everything is based on your stats no matter how much they say it isn't. Such a joke."
bad,"The only way to succeed at Netflix is if you have the knack for making sleazy, exploitative policies sound less objectionable than they really are. In Netflix culture this is referred to as ""positive positioning,"" but the majority of customers correctly interpret it as ""trying to make the people you've ripped off feel good about being separated from their money."" In order to hang onto your job, you need to consistently meet a set of metrics (including AHT and customer satisfaction rate) that can change arbitrarily at any time. Customer satisfaction is determined by a one-question survey issued at the conclusion of each call which asks only whether the customer was satisfied with their experience with Netflix. No distinction is made between the company and the rep, so even if you did your level best to assist the customer you can still be rated unsatisfactory if they're upset about a price hike or something else that's entirely out of your control. The turnover rate is unbelievably high, there is nothing resembling job security, and if you're a temp-to-hire your conversion (which comes with a pay increase and health benefits) can be continually delayed for virtually no reason. Also, a lot of the customers are outrageously rude and hostile and there's nothing you can do about it."
bad,"This is by far the worst job all my coworkers there and I have ever had. Avoid at all costs. It is not worth the trouble. Out of a training class of 50, I was the sole remaining employee after 3 months. 100% turnover, zero consideration for illness (they will force you to work 10 hours days while sick or be fired), no sense of teams or community or work family, and a deranged no-escalation management culture made it thoroughly awful."
bad,"They fired me on the last week of training (six weeks into a multi-college-semester-length [by hour] course) because I ""didn't fit within company culture."" There was no warning, no coaching or feedback. No suggestions or working with me. Just gone. When I asked why, they gave me vague things about not being a good fit and not contributing to the culture they want. They were absolutely cold and unfeeling. Threatened to have me removed from the building despite me showing no signs of agitation or desire to make a scene. I am completely shocked and have NO idea why they fired me. I was doing awesome and working great within my training group. I needed this job so badly. I'm now looking at possible homelessness and losing my car. THEY DO NOT CARE. Don't work here."
bad,"Stay away if you want to be happy in your job. While the pay is well above average, the atmosphere is toxic. Attrition was above 300%. People fired every day. #hungergames"
bad,"This company is typical of every large company, they treat you as if you are easy to replace, and make sure that you know that you are easy to replace."
bad,"Whether it's raining, hailing, snowing, windy, calm, hot, humid, cold, freezing or whatever it may be, typically runs my day at work. I went through 5 managers within the last 5 years. With co-workers, there will always be a co-worker that you can't work with and the others you can work fine. The most enjoyable part of the job is I get paid driving."
bad,"Netflix treats their employees as completely disposable. They seem to constantly be looking for reasons to fire any and all of their employees, including supervisors. Supposedly, this sort of fear-driven culture, where working there a year is considered being a veteran (which is absurd), will give Netflix customers better service. I don't believe it does."
bad,"They literally tell you to ""do what is best for netflix, not what is best for you"" your first day. During training you are not allowed to call in sick. They try to pride themselves on how relaxed and flexible they are, but god forbid you have a health restriction that makes you miss a day of work. The job is too stressful to be worth the pay."
bad,"Being a route driver was one of the most thankless jobs here. If there is a storm, too bad keep going, those movies better be delivered on time no matter what!!!"
bad,"a lot of fake people, employees do not follow companies own standards unfortunately. poor poor management"
bad,"I was very happy my first few weeks , but  there management team sucks. The people that they make supervisors not know how to lead.  I was let go over  i’m very petty and back stabbing issue."
bad,"You will be hired. They will beg you to leave your current position with bad promises. You will work on bad software that has nothing to do with the Netflix people know. People will be resigning and getting fired around you. About 40% attrition on the team when I was there. Your desire to work there initially will fade quickly- about 2-3 months. You will be fired for no reason after a short time or decide to resign after a year or so. Be warned, you will think you're different but it will hurt your career with a waste of time if you have any goals besides quick money - everyone else is offering better anyways. Don't forget your stock will get killed or the company will be taken over :)"
bad,"Decent job, just no real management.  They couldn't feel out the day with productive things to do, so at times you find yourself doing things you wouldn't normally do just to fill out 5-7 hours a day."
bad,Management wasn't the greatest. Don't really have anything great to say about the company. Its a job if you need one
bad,"The job was good when they cared but they never cared about their customers.  That always bothered me.   The options for advancement are very one sided, and unless you are not only doing your job 150%, but schmoozing.  there is no way you will ever be more than a worker.  Then they sold us off completely.  They did not care what it meant to any of us even the managers."
bad,Wasn't to fond of this place to be honest. The working environment was unconventional. I learned that I never want to work shifts other than 1st. The hardest part was having to be there at 3am Monday - Friday.
bad,"no standard for advancement process"
bad,"If you've worked in the IT field, this was nothing new.  It was a classic case of being asked to do things without the proper resources, training, and support, then being raked over the coals for not getting enough done."
bad,"No respect for the ""little guy"". Management does not mirror company values."
bad,"loved my job there just was no good benifits no groth to go any further,i was as high in pay as i could go in 2 years"
bad,It takes an half an hour to an hour just to get to the center.
bad,Um i wouldn't really want to say much but this work environment is very UN professional and the management team is very poor
bad,"No job stability, don't care about anything but making sure the calls don't get a dissatisfaction, don't care about the customers at all want u off the call in 5.5 mins or less, don't care about any ones personal life. I worked there for 3 months and couldn't get anydays requested off no matter how in advance you request it, O and the killer is they had BEDBUGS!!!"
bad,"-Provided customer service and technical support for all incoming customer calls, including assistance with website navigation, billing and shipping issues and customer escalations."
bad,"The pay is very good, however the work environment is very stressful and strict."
bad,"For the first 3 months I was in love with my job. Though i was on my second of 3 supervisors. My third supervisor came in and she absolutely obliterated my job. She tried to fire me the first week she was over us over the most minimal thing. Then about a month later (last week) she got me fired over something they never brought to my attention. They also do not like to follow utah's labor laws. They still have not given me my check almost 5 days after my termination. I do not recommend anyone get into the job. They swear up and down they are the best, and granted I did love the cushy $15/hr, but they do not pay enough for the mental torment you will go through."
bad,"Been through several OM managers, most of the management I started with are gone. Things are totally different due to employee misuse. Rather than confront the abusers as they are favorites, everyone is punished."
bad,"if you need a paycheck, or something where you can leave your work at the office, this would be it. Management was a mess, the job is absolutely thankless, and overall your job security is based on customer surveys, which is a basic Yes/No of how satisfied you were with the employee's assistance, and the company overall. A ""NO"" to either question was very detrimental."
bad,"The group of people that are on the core group and other employees have a wonderful sense of humor. They make it fun to come to work. As a company, it could be a lot more organized when it comes to promotions, hiring, statistics, payroll, etc."
bad,"Leadership was very inconsistant and supervisors were not good at giving clear expectations. Shift bids were a very negative experience for all employess, and despite repeatedly being told, management made no effort to change. While they push strongly statments of inclusion, teamwork, culture, etc. They don't put in the footwork to make it happen. "
bad,"I learned how to talk with customers"
bad,"Ample budget and autonomy to do work, but there's a carelessness for individuals. Consistent fear of being let go due to the fact that people are consistently let go."
bad,A review is not relevant to my resume and qualifications of an applicant for future employment. I worked for Netflix for a total of nine months as a temporary employee. My above ratings for Netflix should adequately reflect my experience as an employee.
bad,I answered phone calls. Resolved customer issues. i.e. lost cds in mail. Nowadays its all live streaming with netflix. We were pushed to sell higher price plans to customers.
bad,basically you are not really helping people. you are giving them generic information that they can look up themselves. they wanted us to lie to people and told us to think of it as being their conceirge. the job is to tell them no without saying the word no. the managers were cool . we also had issues that if we couldn't resolve it we were told to escalate the situation but we were not allowed to talk to the person that takes the cases of higher escalation. I am not sure if a team ever existed.
bad,A typical day at Netflix very busy answering customer calls and questions. Helping them fix there problems. I learned how to be in a different environment. The enjoyable part i love to help peoples out. The hardest part when they have an outage and no one can watch there netflix. 
bad,"It was a fine place to work for the short term. I was there 11 months. i should have spent more of that finding something better. Its not hard work per se, but its exhausting and stressful. I came away with stress induced hives. Avoid."
bad,"Believe me, the benefits are outstanding and HR is very helpful. However their turnover rate is the highest I have ever seen. Management doesn't care."
bad,A typical day at work is coming in signing in my phone and computer and start taking calls. My coworkers were very helpful and always answered any questions I had. The hardest part of this job was sometimes the customers could be very rude. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers fix their problems they were having with their service
bad,"Netflix CS was an awesome company to work for but that changed in October when they said 24-7 inTouch was taking over. Things started to change. People and managers were stating they were leaving in December. They coach to behaviors that is cool but having no paperwork of coachings or warnings is unfair. They will let you go with little to go on. With no official paperwork signed with what warnings were given, it’s just a bunch of he said she said stuff."
bad,"Stressful place to work, huge lack of advancement opportunities. People are often promoted from withing via nepotism. No real work to life balance in this particular role."
bad,"The perk is the pay. The turnaround rate is obscene. Just don't and say you did."
bad,I was expecting a wonderful growing experience but I felt like I was right back in high school with this work place.  I learned a lot about what a leader is and should be by how they are not.
bad,"Very Independent enviornment ,fast pace, and exciting. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and making a five-minute friend."
bad,"The pay was great, and most managers were great. Not very friendly about working around outside life schedules if something comes up."
bad,A typical day working here is helping customers and checking in delivery orders. Working here I learned how to make liquor orders and help customers better. Management was nix and very helpful and so was the coworkers. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the rude customers. The most enjoyable part was laughin and talkin with the customers
bad,this company is very unorganized. the change your work schedule every 2 weeks which is not fair to people with other job and or kids
good,"NetflixCS claims to be different from any other call center environment in many ways. The problem is that, with every development, there are several setbacks. NetflixCS has outsourced many departments and has shown little interest in promoting or retaining talented employees. As with many other similar customer service jobs, they simply do not care, and are just as happy to replace you as they are to hire you. Simply having acceptable compensation and benefits does not a good work environment make."
good,Great and ambitious company to work. for. Everyone is smart and wanting to do well in their position. Everything you read online about the culture of fear is true and there are definitely politics that are played.
good,it was a slow quiet environment unless we had a big order to fill out for the disk to go out then it would have to be a fast paste work you learn about disk what to look for how to scan them.
good,The management is the only bad thing about this job and cause for low morale. There is ping pong and corn hole to play when the management decides agents are allowed to touch it.The company in itself is an amazing company to work for. The way it is ran and who it is ran by in Denver is the issue./
good,clean and send out dvds to different places. i learned how to do things in a fast paced way. the managment was good. the co-workers were nice.
good,On a daily basis I inspected returned DVDs. Steady work never a dull moment.
good,"Had a good time and learned a lot, but i faced many obstacles when it came to work-flow, the managers were incompetent. "
good,This job was definitely one that stands out from the rest. You don't have to dress up or get ready - you just have to be awesome and deliver excellent customer service.
good,Netflix was a constantly changing and unstable work environment. Poor decisions made by the CEO unfortunately led to a drastic reduction in work force.
good,Netflix is a fun place to work at first the longer you work for them the harder it gets. Management doesn't careally about previous achievements. One slip up and boom job is almost always torn away.
good,"we worked when the mail carriers work."
good,"They live their Culture Deck and people are disposable.  The smallest mistake could cost you your job, particularly if the overly-powerful HR business partners take issue with it.  There are some good people there, but by and large the complete lack of job security (they don't hesitate to fire people) creates a CYA culture whereby senior management (directors and above) line their organizations with potential ""fall guys"" that they can lay the blame on (and fire) in the event that anything goes wrong.  At least they pay good severance (4-9 months of salary, depending on level).  "
good,24-7 intouch is so lame no need to go into details its just ratchet easy hire but its not worth it!
good,"good growth ,strong potentials. great features ,high performance environment"
good,"Netflix can be great, but they get to the point they know their pay is so good they own your soul. They preach great values and sometimes the kool aid is oh so sweet. The job is draining, supervisors don't really care, scheduling wise they own you and while the benefits are inexpensive the actual medications and visits are not, if they are covered after all the appeals to the insurers. Don't stay too long, it's not sustainable"
good,"Throw in random rules, lie to you during training, not hard work but annoying. Claim to be not focused on numbers but are, used to be able to advance without degrees and no you are no longer able to. Keep your desk SPOTLESS because there are hall monitors. Overall claim to be a chill culture but are really just tightening the grip on their employees and not treating them like adults, really a bummer. I personally have top stats but still didnt get open opportunities from people who have worse stats like management training, clearly a biased workplace. Overall, just like any other call center, I just dont like hypocrisy in my life."
good,"fun work place, no real structure, very laid back. listen to music all day or watch netflix. no room for growth or development in company.  very team oriented."
good,Highly stressful work environment. Management is more interested in the bottom line than in its employees.  Management felt that the employees were replaceable and the staff felt it.
good,They have great pay. Very little down time and a strict no cell phones regardless of emergency. They lie a little about how numbers don't count. because your performance is strictly based on numbers. Management is hardly around and not very helpful in my experience.
good,"Highly recommend for short term employment."
good,"Pick up and delivery of movies from U.S. post office drove truck to warehouse, team checked and cleaned disk, machine sorted all movies, ensured proper address, and zip codes were legible, deliver movies back to post office on time for disbursement."
good,"I recieve approximately 50-100 calls a day. some to start new serves, or to inquire about the proper devices to use, as well as problem with billing statement. With working with the company I've learned the different techniques to connecting and rebooting different devices. My co-workers have became long lasting friends and i enjoy every moment working with them"
good,I came in before everything got sold out and got to watch a great thing fall apart when it when front netflix to 24-7 intouch..  everything went down hill. But they were already acting up.
good,"Pay is great, but stressful and every day is different. People were let go daily for missing goals. This caused even more stress on the teams. No one was safe."
good,Ripping open mail and inspecting DVDs and cleaning and sorting out DVDs at 650 per hour to get hired. Now they have machines to inspect DVDs. Machine operation is a must.
good,I initially loved the culture of the company and the views they held on good customer service. I think the culture was lost a little with worrying about speed metrics over customer care. Very good training opportunity on the phones and learning how to deal with all sort of customers.
good,A typical day at Netflix would include answering phone calls and making sure a customer felt heard and taken care of. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people all across the country and building clientele through great customer service.
good,"Most of the day consisted of inspecting discs & loading up envelopes for the machines. When I wasn't doing either of those, I was cleaning up the work area, collecting cases of discs, & un/loading the trucks. I learned how to inspect the discs in a quick and efficient manor. I think we were well managed, we generally finished on time. Everyone was easy to get along with. The hardest part at first was getting used to repetitive the job was, but you get used to it and eventually time flies by. I enjoyed how low stress the job was. You knew what to expect everyday."
good,taking calls pretty much micro managed all day. irritating fake people in your face all day
good,"Netflix is considered a ""Hostile Work Environment"" by the state of Oregon because of its demanding call center metrics that must be met, and because of their turnover rate. Netflix pays really well, but it isn't worth the lack of training or advancement options. The company acts like they care about the customer first, but they don't seem to care about them when a rep hasn't hit his metrics on the dot. Customer service should be customer oriented, and not focusing more on the metrics being met. "
good,A resonable paying job with no future or pay raises. Managment did listen to me or fellow driver
good,"Managment is very deceiving, takes weeks to get an answer out of them, IF you get an answer at all."
good,Netflix is an overall good place to work. Its tough work and its mentally exhausting but the pay is worth it.
good,"Netflix is a decent company. They pay their employees fairly well. However, they are actively downsizing, and management either never has any idea what's ahead, or they don't plan ahead with the knowledge they do have. If you can get in, it's an okay job for temporary needs, but it's probably not the place you'll be able to build a career."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty chill, what i learned fro Netflix was own ur own performince. Mangment was not all that cool not 100% fare. Co workers where nice and easy to work with. my hardest part of my job was weaking up at 3:30 a.m. Best part of the day was when u talked to a clint who was on the other side of the country and being able to asure and relate with the clint."
good,"Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday I had to work 5am till about 2pm, every Wednesday except the one in the middle of the month I had to be there at 3:30am and work until about 2pm and the Wednesday in the middle of each month I had to be there at 2:30am and work until about 2pm!"
good,"It's an entertainment company.  It's a technology company.  It's both, which leads to great things and terrible things. They pay well and have a compelling product."
good,"The Telus office was an amazing environment, very friendly and compassionate.Hostile callers and poor rating system keeps workers from shining and being seen for accomplishments. Method of call assistance promotes fast paced and poor assistance for callers."
good,"Netflix started out as a bad job. The hub was just growing, we worked 15hr days and since we could only work 40hrs most of us would waste time going in for one hr to make up the time."
good,"great place to work, I got to learn the process of what went on the warehouse side of thing. I like my co-workers, it was a good experience. It was a great learning experience"
good,"Netflix pays it's employees extremely well with included benefits that are hard to beat. The culture was a stressful environment with consistent changes, yet hardly any follow through."
good,"Great Co-Workers, Good benefits, but had issues with management, they lie to you, tell you that you will get a pay raise or promotion, but they do not stay true to their word. I enjoyed working at this place, but once you get on managements nerves, they will lay you off and tell you the reason is that you do not know how to repair the machines, which I did and was one of the few people that would actually repair the machines. Another issue was breaks, sometimes they do their best to work you as long as possible without giving you a break, even so by breaking the law and having you work over four hours straight, which I have done multiple times. They also tell you that you can call for breaks, which they gave me the power and then they yell at you for calling breaks. If you ask for breaks, they usually say no despite you working 4 hours, which I have called for a break without permission a few times. The reason not getting a raise is because my attitude was supposely bad because I would ask for a break or ask about when I was getting the raise I was promised. Management has no idea and it was the worst management group I ever worked under, and it was mainly the head boss, the assistant manager was decent most of the time."
good,"Travel over entire country checking and repairing automation equipment to deliver DVD's by mail.  Job required about 80% travel but home on weekends and booked our own travel, not bad."
good,It is a warehouse job. It requires labor work including material handler and maintenance. there are also machines so there were many machine operators so it was very loud.
good,well the first thing we do when we start shift is we sort all the mailers that we get from the post office then they go to a bronway arrm 3600 auto mailer assembly system and its designed to disassemble a patented mailer which contains a barcode text verified sleeve Dvd at production rates of up to 60 parts per minute.
good,Working as a production assistant on a Netflix project.  Really the same as working for any other studio.  Netflix is more hands off than most other studios.
good,Netflix was a very exciting place to work days went by very fast. I enjoyed that the days were always different and people were always very friendly and liked to help eachother
good,warehouse work that consisted of looking at netflix movies that where returned had to check for damages to the movies and clean the ones that where still fixable etc
good,"Its business above everything when talking about this company.   Although the overall operation is easy, the management aspect of the company got some work to do."
good,"Overall was a decent place to work."
good,"The great thing working for Netflix is people generally loved the product, so there wasn't much animosity working their phones. Unfortunately Netflix and Amazon were feuding over customer service quality so the turnover at Netflix customer service center was enormous. They only hired the best and kept rotating our desks so we wouldn't notice our coworkers being replaced when their numbers dipped. Great pay though."
good,Great company to work for especially if you enjoy talking about movies.  The environment is a typical call center work place and is a fairly simple place to work for.
good,A high volume call center and customer service through email. Netflix gave the customer reps a lot of freedom in handling issues. It was a fun culture and we got a lot of Netflix swag. The calls were fairly quick mostly regarding lost discs or help with signing up on the internet.
good,Working for Netflix was a fun experience. I was able to talk to people from around the country and sometimes different parts of the world. That made the job a lot more fun and interesting.
good,"The company is a great place to gain knowledge and experience."
good,"Netflix was an great experience, Very fun place to work an also be apart of. I really enjoyed my job an the perks that came along with it."
good,"Netflix is a fun place to work, especially if you are a young adult with out any family obligations. I say this because they are very business driven and their customers come first. There wasnt any room for family emergencies."
good,"Took calls at a rapid pace concerning the plan and pricing change, corrected account issues, changed plans, resolved issues with shipping and receiving, trouble shot issues, changed payment methods."
good,"The days were okay"
good,"I worked for Netflix, I processed DVD movies to customers that requested certain movie titles. Our goal was to have the DVD movies shipped by the next day. I also made sure that the customers did not receive damage or dirty DVD'S and the wrong movie titles. The work I did for Netflix was very fast paced and sometimes we had very long days. During the late mornings after lunch time I would work on the sorter, so that DVDS could be sorted to its proper mailing address, then after that I would band and load truck with mail and then drive the mail to the Greensboro, N.C. post office. On some weeks I would deliver the mail to Charlotte, Raleigh, and Fayetteville N.C. My co-workers were very hard workers and great at getting the job done on a timely basis. The most enjoyable part about my job, was making sure that our customers were satisfied with our products."
good,"netflix is a fun place to work "
good,Was a good place to work when I started. Management was fair.
good,A typical day at work is usually repetitive and always taking up new things. There's something to learn about new at work which is a good thing. The management is very supportive and the co workers are very helpful.
good,"go early in the morning to start the dvd sort for the beginning week, have everything set up and ready to get the mail out of the door"
good,On the one hand you are in a culture that offers a great deal of autonomy and freedom. In some aspects this is a fantastic benefit and allow for individual thinking and action planning. On the other hand it is very difficult to organize and drive toward organizational consistency.
good,"The crew and trainers who I was set to work with were great. I unfortunately had to leave Netflix due to medical problems, but was pleased with the amount of training I received. I never once met or saw my direct boss, but saw my trainers on a constant basis. The work was relatively slow paced, which left a lot of room for no productivity."
good,"I loved my job overall as well as dealing with the customers, I had to resign due to I was pregnant and my case ended up becoming high risk . So for me to travel as far as I was was almost impossible. The TL that I was placed under was newer to the company then I was so I feel that did cause some riff."
good,The main thing I didnt like about netflix was the turnover rate for management.  When i needed help with an issue most of the time they didnt know what to do because they were also new to the company.    At one point they had bed bugs ......but it was always a movie playing or music to help get through the day.  Overall it was very fun just not the JOB for me....
good,Good job for hard workers with little room for advancement. Get everything in writing for your own protection.
good,"Supervisors revolve every 30 days to 4 months, so consistency is non-existent; sometimes you're not even told that you have a new supervisor.  On-line tools needed to assist customers are often broken.  "
good,"I worked at the call center which basically meant sitting at a phone for 10 hours a day. I like customer service but didn't enjoy the repetitive scenario of the interaction. I learned the keys to quality customer service messaging, maintaining honesty and being positive without patronizing. Occasionally though messaging that would be suggested by management would feel dishonest or deceptive despite the company's value of honesty. The management was really great, but the opportunities to move up were limited. Turn-over was high, both from firing and quitting"
good,Es tan monotono que se vuelve desesperante........
good,"Fast past call center specifically team driven, various different situations everyday. Overall good stable call center job with plenty of room for improvement."
good,"In a call center environment I provided Netflix streaming members with exceptional service. I met and maintained a daily dsat and average handle time for both weekly, and monthly. I was among the top ten representatives consistently and was given the opportunity to work with the new hires."
good,Netflix (at least at the time I was working there) did a good job of hiring people who would fit into their culture and did a good job training their people. That said there was a lot expected of every employee considering what they were being paid. It was a call center and everything you do in the building was strictly monitored. If you were 5 seconds late logging into your phone to take calls at the start of your shift or returning from a break or lunch it was noted and someone would be talking to you about it.
good,"The job is not a difficult job, but it is very redundant and the constantly want improvement even when improvement is not easy. It is hard to come in to the same thing every day and it gets to the point you dread hearing the beep in your ear letting you know a call is coming. Most customers calling in are angry about things you cannot control such as being unable to take certain payment methods by phone or content you can't put on for them. you get at least one angry customer a day typically on average and it is difficult on your self esteem and it is an emotionally draining job. THAT is what makes it difficult not the job at hand itself."
good,A typical day at work you would troubleshoot and or update customers information. Some of the management was great to work with very up lifting. The associates that I worked with were great individuals with outstanding spirits. The hardest part of the job was helping some people through trouble shooting steps with inexperience of certain devices. And the most enjoyable part was we got to watch movies and interacted throughout the day!
good,"Netflix                                                April-2012 present"
good,"I took anywhere from 80-120+ calls from customers each day. I advanced my customer service skills, and learned about all of the Netflix systems, and streaming equipment. Management was rather scattered and disorganized. Co-workers were great, and we worked as a team to solve problems."
good,8 hour work day with Mondays as the busiest. Majority of the management are good people to work for. The culture was family oriented until the CSR cutbacks became real.
good,"Very high stress call center, however was offset by"
good,"did not work enough to comment"
good,"Management makes sure that the work environment is fun and drama free, everyone is friendly and upbeat."
good,It took a little while to admit this but it wasn't a good job fit for me. Initially great company to work for. Heard from some that still worth there that they are being switched to a third party teleperformance which is a horrible company.
good,"From the time you clock in to the time you clock out, you'll be taking phone calls from people all over the world that need help. The supervisors are all here to help you achieve your goals. The hardest part is having to talk over the phone with people all day long."
good,"The company and work contitions/ benefits were awesome, buuuut the job was much more demanding that could have been expected (concerning stress level and escalated contacts). Few opportunities to grow. Best team!"
good,"Netflix is a very nice company to work for, I really enjoy my job. I just need more hours.The hours of operation are excellent. My boss is a wonderful person and I love my co-workers."
good,I started my day with receiving movie and game discs.We would check them for damage and cleanl them.We had to be able to check 350 discs in about 30 minutes. I enjoyed working with everyone there.What I learned will keep my personal movies and games clean for the rest of my life. Some times I got to stay and do shipping.We would put the movies and games to be shipped into their envelopes. This was my favorite part.
good,Manager was good to work with and pay was great. (supervisor different story)
good,No structure. Studio is young compared to other traditional studios but it's still a mess with structure. You're encouraged to have courage to speak up if workflow can be improved but you can also be seen as combative.
good,Got to learn many new thing wonderful experience with lead generation appointment fixing planing and conducting the presentations for the clients. recruiting the adequate candidates to provide required support to the client companies.
good,"A great Company to work for, but it like a revolving door you never no when they will let you go. Also the FTE play favorite with who they no. and the contractor are not treated the same, but they do have great perks for all employees where breakfast and lunch is served for free. But there feedback policy is no good at all and you have to question the culture vision."
good,very fun place to work but due to being under staffed there was no room to breathe between phone calls. the survey the customers take at the end of the call has nothing to do with the representative they just spoke with it asks if they are happy with the netflix service but we get affected by the negative results
good,"Environment was very relaxing, and welcoming, the only problem was in the leadership being too stressed to do their job properly, and you really have no opportunity for advancement as the leadership sleeps with your coworkers."
good,"A typical day at Netflix is Taking calls while customer connecting, relating, assuring, troubleshooting, and solving problems. I learned that all calls are the same and to let the customer feel that they are always right no matter what so that the call never gets out of  control. My co-workers are awesome amazing friendly people whom i love to work with. There really is no hard part about the job but the most enjoyable part about the job getting a customer who makes my day and me as an agent being able to help them with their problem"
good,Netflix was a down to earth job where all became family. We were all team players. when the machines broke down we were able to wacth movies until the machines were fix.
good,"The Workplace was Absolutely Admirable and then 24/7 Intouch took over and eventually closed the Salt Lake City, Utah Site. Lost all benefits and had to learn new takeover company systems. All co-workers began quitting and becoming hostile towards all co-workers. Had amazing insurance at first, amazing events, Prize giveaways, Best Supervisors ever."
good,"NetflixCS is an All-Star when it comes to employee benefits. Extremely flexible with schedules as long as it is not detrimental to the business. Pays half of health insurance premiums."
good,I enjoyed listening to music while I worked on the machines. When I first started working there it was fun people were tired but for the most part happy. Shortly after I was hired they started laying off and firing most of the employees. They also kept changing and getting rid of supervisors and managers. It was also very difficult to progress even though they said there was room for growth.
good,"A typical work day starts at 2:30 am with return mail processing and the day usually ends about 9-10:00am."
good,"8 hour shifts with 2 15 min breaks. taking multiple customer calls to sort out why they are unable to make their Netflix work properly. involved trouble shooting customer equipment, and trouble shooting the costumier."
good,"This is a company that is good to work for if you keep yourself as a priority. Overall loved my time here, but there is an emphasis on transparency and communication that is not adhered to. Great benefits and really good pay, but was sold off to a 3rd party company in the end"
good,Good place to work. Growing company and they care about there employees.  Centrally located in Hollywood with numerous projects  on the horizon. Good Place.
good,Worked at this company for many years allowing me to grow. Great people to work with. Small group of employees but overall great company culture Management was great
good,"I tried it and noticed it was subnormal 90% quality so I gave 3 technicians advice to redesign it. 2 Technicians said they would report it to their manager, one said nothing."
good,There was a lot of good things working for the company but it did not promote a healthy work atmosphere. There is no follow up to losing your job when it happens it happens despite having a valid reason or not.
good,"nothing to review since this wasn't my most recent job, I left this job since 2012. I did like the free unlimited streaming and dvd rentals plan they had."
good,Working for Netflix is extremely amazing experience. The work environment is completely relaxed yet professional and The staff is amazing. The company and make sure the employees are excited and energized by providing many incentives. I would highly recommend this job to anyone.
good,Benefits are great. Pay increase every 6 months of employment.   Typically able to grow & develop. Currently not much room for progression through other departments/roles.
good,"Before the company got a new head of operations, there was a fantastic culture, advancement opportunities everywhere, and great clear coaching. After that it all fell short, the company started hiring eternally instead of promoting within. there were no Promotions offered for CSR2 for over a year while I worked there. If you're going there, don't expect to move up for a long time."
good,"The job and compensation was excellent, but the hours were long and it was a drain on the soul. It was fun to learn the infrastructure of how Netflix worked, but at the end of the day, it was an unsustainable amount of work."
good,"Typical day is taking two chats at a time with customers concerning billing, connection issues, and content. It was a fun work environment but not much room for advancement."
good,"This was a temporary job for me.  It was a fun environment - always on the leading edge of technology."
good,"Loved the environment."
good,Everyday you dealt with something new and sometimes unusual but Netflix insures that you can be part of an excellent team and still have some individuality.
good,"Free Netflix subscription for employees, and great work schedules"
good,"The Netflix call center is a decent place to work but I was just there at the wrong time. Just after I was hired full-time as a temp employee, they instilled a hiring freeze meaning no one could be hired on by the company and get the promised benefits. Then I was given a new supervisor and we didn't mesh very well. After he fired me I learned that he himself was fired soon after."
good,A typical day was showing up and inspecting incoming discs until all of them for that day were inspected.
good,Typical call center job. Can be stressful but its a great job if you are good at it
good,I would work there again. I liked my co-workers we worked well together. They are a fair company and I would recommend them to my friends.
good,"Netflix as a company is amazing. Their product and values are bar none. The Netflix culture is unlike anything else and fun to be a part of. The only downfall over time has been their lack of communication and leadership at certain positions. Mismanagement and wages that havent kept up with the cost of living contribute to low agent morale and a numbers driven culture instead of behavior driven. All in all a great job that is very valuable but there is a great disconnect between working directly with Netflix, and working for one of their BPO contact centers as the focus seems to be on cost cutting and sending everything overseas."
good,"Netflix is great! I am a independent contractor, therefore when there are certain movies they call me to work  for that period of time. When they are on hiatus, that is challenging. "
good,Netflix was a fun place to work at first but one of my senior supervisor wasn't fun to work with at  times but you its your job to get sum done ..so basically that's wat I did get to work make sure I get whatever task was assign to me done
good,Typically we would arrive very early and stay very late.  The amount of time spent on set would very according to how well the shooting was going.  The management was very kind and understanding of any needs from people and would adapt on the fly.  The workplace culture was fast paced and relaxed at the same time.  Wherever you were there is a fun conversation to be had with people.  The long hours can get tedious however it isn't the worst thing in the world.
good,"good place to work until they decide that you are too opinionated and asks questions about why decisions are made by management.  It's now a ""it's our way or the highway"" mentaility"
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar e crescer pessoalmente.  Exige bom atendimento, mas devido ao grande fluxo de atendimento não estava sendo possivel no momento!"
good,Shifts are unstable and you have to be willing to change your schedule during shift bidding. If you are in college it may be difficult to set a consistent schedule.
good,very chilled laid back environment.I learn having more patients and leadership skills.love my co-workers.honestly its nothing hard about the job at all.most enjoyable part about the job is that management he hands on.
good,A very good place to grow in experience as an individual. Learned more than I thought I could learn about working on Machinery at Netflix Inc.
good,"We would enter work at 2am and receive anywhere between 20,000 and 100,000  DVDs and then we would inspect them for any problems and send them back to inventory and this process lasts for about 3 hours and then I would go to the back of the building and run sorting machines which sends the DVDs to thew right area while simultaneously package the DVDs into sleeves with a sorting machine and once it's finished we send all the packaged up dvds to the post office."
good,"Conectarse al sistema, empezar el chat con el cliente y resolver cualquier duda que tenga o bien ayudarle a ver Netflix. Una vez que el cliente ha terminado con sus dudas, despedirlo y pasar al siguiente; repitiendo esto el dia laboral mientras platicas con compañeros y supervisores que trabajan en conjunto con nosotros."
good,"Running the stuffer's machines, was a big challenge."
good,"Great place to work ! Teaches you a lot about technology and internet connections. Co-workers are fun and outrageous very diverse. Enjoyed everyday, poor decisions on how to lay off management."
good,"Well managed distribution center for movie rentals. I learned how to process large amounts of detailed information into a variety of computer applications. Operated packaging, labeling and mail sorter for distribution to post office."
good,"Run and process all incoming coming and out going mail. Learned how to operate mail sort machine by myself dalily. Management was easy to get along with, worked with you if you had any issues. Co-workers where very easy to get along because it was a crew of four."
good,"A day at Netflix would include opening the mail, sorting, allocating and packaging of product. I learned how to be hands on as well as Manage a crew of up to 70 employees. Being an Asst. Manager taught me how to delegate, assign tasks and follow up after completion. My co-workers were the best group of people I ever had the privilege of working with. The job was very physically and emotionally demanding but the hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable areas would be the day to day aspects and the end results; knowing that we did what was needed to get the mail out the door in a timely manner to give the Customers the best service possible."
good,"It would be 1am and i would drink my coffee at work and get to coordinating each employee by my boss' standards, i received much disobediance but always got the job done. I enjoyed playing ping pong during break and got the oppurtunity to meet several good individuals. The times got hard and my co-workers got harder and i'm now excited for a new venture."
good,"If you are a young person and like to party a lot this job is fantastic."
good,"Overall great company but high turnover and can be competitive. If you are looking for stability, I would not recommend this company. It is a great opportunity to learn and your fellow employees will push you to excel."
good,"I worked as an extra for a new TV show. I was hoping that they would pay a little better (didn't cover distance traveled at all), but the environment was professional. Good communication across the board. Really enjoyed it."
good,"This was not a hard job as long as you could keep up with the required amount of boxes to be done. In the morning you go through all the returned DVDs, inspect them and put them in a box for processing. sounds easy but you can't be slow about it and same goes for after lunch when you have to repack DVDs for shipping."
good,I just know i did my job and was treated pretty fairly within the job.. THe job was pretty easy and and good comfortable office setting with the ability to get the job done
good,"I was a temp/contractor foe six months. Excellent pay and great flexibility. Free catered breakfast and lunches."
good,"Advancement is very rare. It can be cut throat. Your experience can vary because each manager is different. If you're great at your job exceptions will be made otherwise, you may get fired."
good,overall its a fun laid back place to work.  We answered calls concerning billing and tech support and i learned alot of technical stuff dealing with the various electronic devices that are out there. the management and co workers were fun to be around.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to assist all customers with their device issues due to at times it was the device itself.  and the opposite of that is that it is enjoyable when we are able to fix their devices.
good,"there wasnt much opportunity to grow there. there were only a few advancement opportunities, and everyone fought for them, if there had been more places to grown it would have been a fine place to work."
good,Great place to work! Getting time off can be a bit hard but the supervisors will work with you as long as you give them a heads up in advanced. The call center is great the job is not hard you just have to remember that dealing with customers over the phone isn't always as pleasant as it might seem.
good,"Smart and passionate people work there."
good,"Netflix is a lot of fun, I mean your working for an entertainment company and they do just that. The only hard part is customers and even then there not too bad. The environment is light and yet professional."
good,Its fast past job  and you must be a morning person or else you would be able to work .Good on attention details and you must be goal oriented
good,"Overall good work life balance, great for building skills leading small teams to KPI's, company seems to be in constant limbo of identity and direction."
good,Very unique place to work.  Freedom and responsibility culture
good,"I believe I had a great job as a Machine Operator. I enjoyed being able to work on my own, with great results. Repair 2 out 3 machines to maintain productivity. The money was decent, and management was fine. The hours of 2am to 11am were rough. Still a good job all the way around."
good,"data entry, postal operations, packaging, quality control"
good,"Customers treat you badly and you have to accept it. "
good,"At netflix i worked graveyard from 6:30pm to 4:30 am. when you get to work you go to call station and take calls, Answering any and all customer inquiries while maintaining a high customer satisfaction rating and keeping your average handle time as low as possible."
good,driving to post office for pick up and delivery. and processing incoming and out going dvds
good,I loved this job and my colleague's.  great people and great management. they was well understanding due to people circumstance. this job has help me have good communication skills.
good,"I was at Netflix years ago and review is too out of date to be useful. The company changes very quickly and is fast-paced. It was an enjoyable job, but people especially managers seemed expendable and got fired easily."
good,"A typical day at work was taking phone calls, helping customers troubleshoot their Netflix. I learned a lot working for Netflix, some supervisors were really awesome and wiling to help you learn more about different departments while others were more about you just doing your job instead of helping you develop. Netflix says they are all about the ""culture,"" but what they preach is not everything you see when you actually start working there. A lot of what they say, doesn't actually happen. Which I get, sometimes it doesn't meet the business needs. But it shouldn't be promised if they are not going to go through with it. They were making some changes that were definitely going in the right direction which I was super excited to be a part of, but sadly because of some of their policies that they are just playing with in attendance area, I am no longer able to participate in. My favorite parts of the job was the people I got to work with and being able to dress and have my hair how I wanted. Though my number 1 favorite part was the chat department which they got ""rid"" of. It is one of the better call centers out there and one of the better companies I have worked for."
good,There's a very relaxed environment with great work perks but management has very high expectations in making sure you provide the best possible experience for customers at all times. They're very open to giving you feedback on how you're doing well in addition to how you can improve and try to find ways to motivate you to do well. Theres no scripts when taking to customers and they encourage taking more like a person than a robot.  Taking time off or scheduling can be very difficult for customer service reps.
good,"Netflix was okay to work for a while, although sometimes it could get overwhelming with people calling and yelling at you saying you broke their netflix."
good,"Its alright for a call center, it pays well but that is about it. They also have good benefits but getting time off here is almost impossible."
good,"Worked the shipping and receiving office. Hours 9 am to 5:30. Unloaded daily deliveries of all DVD'S.  Then the second half of the day I shipped out the Netflix swag for all 55 Hubs ( shirts to hats etc)"
good,"I clock into work and usually get started right away on whatever I am assigned to do that morning. I have learned how to perform my tasks quickly and safely and in a timely manner for when it is time for everything to be shipped out. I have always enjoyed working alongside my managers and coworkers. They have helped me a lot along the way and from that I have learned so much. The hardest part of this job is probably the hours. You don't realize it at first, but working overnight hours is an entire life adjustment. It was very difficult at first but now my body is used to it. I enjoy pretty much everything about this job. One of my favorite parts is being in a team oriented environment where everyone helps each other. We wouldn't be able to function as a whole without team work. This may sound strange, but I also enjoy the physical labor part of the job, It's almost like getting paid to work out sometimes."
good,Enjoyed my time. Great place to learn life skills. Really smart people who genuinely care about employees. At the time work/life balance was tough but seems to have gotten a lot better in that department.
good,"Netflix is one of the best companies I have worked at. Its fun, great leadership, excellent values, and they are very receptive to feedback. Its a very customer focused company. However their is a high turnover rate from what I have witnessed as well as not having career paths available. Their was room to grow but only within the same department. If I was interested In moving from one department to another, It pretty much isn't possible. Netflix has great leaders and management is amazing. They really want to ensure you as an employee is taken care of and to make sure you are happy. One of my favorite aspects is on the quarterly meetings they include all employees on how the company is doing as well as growing."
good,"I would come in get my paper and check my load & them load my truck. Then reports all safety concerns immediately to my management.I did not  see co-works til 6:30 am.The best part of the job was i got home to see my wife. driven over 500 miles on the route.Them 40 miles to get home it was a good day"
good,Netflix has a bold culture for innovation. It compensates at the top of the market imposes high performance standards.
good,I made some great friends and memories there. I got some amazing opportunities that I would not have gotten before since DVD headquarters was at our location. 8/10 would work there again.
good,"Ambiente agradable, Buena motivacion, siempre buscando mejorar y mantenernos bien motivados, no se como sea ahora que se fue de Arvato, pero era muy buen lugar para trabajar."
good,"Read the culture statement on their website. It is accurate. You are part of a team and not a family. If you are looking for a family, then this is not your place. Be prepared to continually prove yourself."
good,"A typical work day would be getting on the phones and helping people with their Netflix questions. "
good,"Netflix culture is about team work and advancement.  When there was a position that was available, they put out an announcement and invited anyone to apply."
good,Good people. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Lots of good projects. The people there are very talented and knowledgable. Collaboration is really effective.
good,"easy job.   troubleshooting connection problems and service issues is all straightforward and by the book.  "
good,"Great colleagues and work environment without a lot of the workplace drama found elsewhere. You do occasionally feel like a contract assassin for hire and when your time's up you just might get assassinated yourself. But, I think the culture is very clear and transparent about that."
good,Netflix empowered its employees on the day to day but failed to provide career growth and mentoring.  Promotion and career advancements are extremely subjective.
good,"Working here made me have a sense of family, we had weekly team meetings to go over work related things but also to make sure everybody is doing well in and outside of work."
good,"Fast Paced Work"
good,i enjoyed my time of the production floor. the job wasn't difficult and the people were friendly. the wages were good and so were the benefits.
good,I really liked this job. It was exciting and had a lot of great opportunities for advancement as well as prizes for meeting quota. for example a good dsat(dissatisfaction rate) being low could win you a ps4 or Xbox.
good,Netflix is such a great place to work. Love to work with everyone.
good,"I learned how to provided excellent customer service , detailed two week training is provided. everyday was a new experience. Great work place ,with wonderful stuff and management."
good,"Typical day at work is taking calls back to back and being able to breath thru the calls if you need to."
good,"Freedom and responsibility rules your day to day decisions, you choose what you want to work on to make the product better.                    "
good,Netflix is a challenging place to work than manages to stay true to its culture while consistently pushing the envelope. Great opportunities and ability to work with the best of the best. Little work-life balance and your time is in demand.
good,I don't want to share my duties and work experience but it was great working with them. I don't feel comfortable sharing my experience I can go in depth in the interview.
good,"I loved Netflix. It gets repetitive and sometimes stressful but they try to keep the atmosphere positive and friendly. They’re always asking what they can do to help, and supervisors have your back as long as you’re real with them."
good,"Muy buena empresa, tanto con horarios y nóminas siempre me quedaron bien."
good,I loved that we did different games during calls to show our work and speed. They were very good with advance scheduling and offered tons of overtime during the holiday seasons.
good,"pay was typical for the type of work, metrics were closely watched and attendance and adherence were very important due to the nature of the work. lots of great people."
good,"I was only a freelance consultant for a production documentary project for Netflix.  However, all interaction I had was positive and taught me different skills."
good,If you were patient and passionate about helping customers than you couldn't fail at this call center. The calls were 100% that there was an error with the service that the customers needed assistance with. The  call centers job was to help the customers either correct the error or identify who wold be best to assist.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho. "
good,"Netflix customer service is by far one of the most laidback places to be employed. Not only can you look forward to practically unlimited overtime, but the hours are extremely flexible as well."
good,Is a very fast-pace working company.I learn that the job is very hard if you dont pay attention to things.i had to help others with the sorters and help them clean there area.Help them prepare the are for the next person to come.
good,"Great well paying job for temporary"
good,"Internship was great. I met a lot of interesting people and learned a lot. Realized the field wasn't for me, but I enjoyed the experience. It made me realize I enjoy fast paced environments."
good,"Great pay, could people, fun product. High turnover and can be tiring depending on the position you have. Awesome culture though, with great perks for employees."
good,"This was a great job in the fact the the co-workers and the atmosphere were relaxed, and overall friendly. However, they gave little opportunity for in house promotions though originally promised all promotions would be in house. Training provided was proficient, but could have been stronger as the company later changed it's customer care requirements. The benefits at this job were amazing, and overall I would definitely recommend this company to anyone ow that they have fully established the needs of the company and customer care required as well."
good,"Enjoy working with this company, if it wasn't due to the travel distance I would not want to leave. Employees are fun, nice hr dept is very understanding and will due what they can for you"
good,"From day one I loved this companies culture and all those people I was so lucky to have had an opportunity to work with.  They really do try and hire the best and brightest, and it shows.  From the top down in this workforce this is a great deal of respect and they strive for a flat organization."
good,"A typical day of work is conversing with different customers all over the world which is a great experience. I've seen that Netflix has brought many families together really giving that old movie night feel back to households. The management here is cool, hip and up to date; they're awesome sauce!!! My co workers and I were higher-ed in off of personality so there is not a day that goes by where there's not a smile on my face. The hardest part of my job is continuing to give an amazing customer experience of the coarse of a 8-10 hour day. But it's necessary because every customer is their own person so that really pushes me. But the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the new shows or movies on Netflix and being able to catch up or start on a new series of shows in the coarse of a work day."
good,"cleaning DVDs"
good,I worked for Netflix which is a company that ships out CDs and DVDs to customers for online services.
good,This Company was okay very busy.  You had to make sure that your work load was steadily productive.
good,Working for Netflix is a great experience. I enjoy working for the company but am finding myself needing something new as I get ready to move.
good,"I have improved my Management and communication skills, through weekly training directly from onsite Manager and conference calls with peers. The most enjoyable part of the job by far is getting to troubleshoot and repair the equipment."
good,"- Small company feel with opportunity to wear many hats"
good,La cultura laboral es muy buena y tienen un gran ambiente de trabajo pero si es algo estresante ya que tienes que lidiar con los problemas de los clientes y clientes enojados.
good,I enjoyed my time working as an IT technician for netflix. The atmosphere and the people in the job were all very positive and helpful with a lot of advancement opportunities. Everyone in the job was interested in you as a person and wanted to do anything in their power to get you to the position you wanted to be in. The work was very rewarding and acknowledged by the company as well.
good,Netflux is a great place to work and the pay is outstanding for the type of work. The only issues i had was every 3 months they hold a shift bid. If you numbers are on the lower end then you were not eligible for the shift that you would like. If your top of the food chain you can have the best shift. The hours are always changing. I started to work over nights and then they got rid of it 6 weeks later then they brought it back a month after that. I went from early morning to over nights to evenings. I couldnt handle the constant shift changing.
good,"The Job itself is easy but living the ""culture"" and life that a call center creates can be exhausting. very social circles makes it either very easy or difficult to get promoted."
good,"When I worked there I like the company, it was fun. My managers worked with me to change my hours so I could pursue other career opportunities.  This was a different time before streaming so I am not sure how it is to be there now."
good,"Netflix is an amazing culture to be a part of, and excellent choice of employment. I was with them for about 2 years, and can honestly say it is the best job I've ever had."
good,I loved my job but some aspects like coaching's and stats were felt like were out of your control. Also the Chat Department is closed so it is no longer available.
good,I worked for netflix for almost 2 years. It gave me the chance to help build a company. I was one of the first agents to work for netflixcs. While working there I sawany changes happen over the 2 years. I also had the chance to help build the company's culture and grow larger.
good,"This is a wonderful place to work. People, environment, pay, everything is great. very strict on attendance. and offers excellent benefits."
good,This job taught me a lot how to work in a fast paced environment effectively.  The most difficult part was lifting on heavy items. My co-workers and manager all were their to encourage each other and get the job done.
good,I am currently a contractor with Netflix. I have enjoyed my experience here it has been amazing I would love to start a career here but being a contractor you never know where the job may go. Great place to work!
good,I loved working for Netflix. It was the most demanding company I worked for. The company strives on work ethic and rewards people accordingly. There are a lot of great opportunities within the company for advancement. Unfortunately my facility closed and I was unable to move to be relocated.
good,It was a great place to work! The customers were awesome as well as the staff! I loved it! And it's super easy to get to! Definitely a good career path.
good,"Netflix gives great benefits for working there, 401K and health insurance is amazing, plus the parental leave is great. All you do is answer phone calls everyday and help customers fix problems with either their Netflix account or if it isn't working how they want it to work. Only problem is there isn't a lot of opportunity for advancement, and when they do hire for jobs higher up, doesn't matter how long you have been there they always hire outside."
good,"My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help."
good,I just found that the company was a little too relaxed for my comfort. I don't appreciate the atmosphere. It makes it difficult for me to focus on the duties at hand.
good,"Great energy, learned how to develop active listening as well as communication skills to better resolve customers concerns and questions."
good,"Everyday was exciting at Netflix. Even if the phones were ringing off the hook, we never stopped motivating each other and pushing forward to deliver the best customer service possible."
good,"a typical day at work is making sure we help all the customers with their tech issues. I learned how to be an even greater customer service rep, because the management was great, as well as the co-workers. The hardest part is trying every solution to the issue and not resolving it, because you tryed your best.. and getting the job done helping the customer find the solution and getting great feedback from the customers has to be the most enjoyable part."
good,"If you love a quick pace with constant changes in direction, and being surrounded by some very talented and intelligent individuals this is a place for you. Loved my experience there..."
good,"Netflix is an amazing company to work for. Their culture was great, there were always opportunities to advance in the workplace, and the managers there were always willing to help you, whether it was to advance within Netflix or outside of the company. The hours were great, and the job was very fast paced. It's a high-volume call center. It's to be expected to get about 50-60 calls a day. Very rarely did you get a negative or angry call. Overall, it was a great company to work for!"
good,Leuke kans gekregen om daar te werken vanwege prive omstandigheden moest ik helaas stoppen.
good,Working for Netflix truly taught me what customer service really is and how to take care of customers. I worked here for 3 years and I met a lot of great people that made fun work. Supervisors always showed that they cared about you and made sure you always were happy and needed anything. There were times during peak season when it was stressful but we always got awesome incentives to keep us motivated.
good,Good experience overall enjoyed keeping up with hood movies while at work and helping customers process payments as well as troubleshooting their devices
good,"Lots of room for creativity in a relaxed atmosphere. Management is easy, ""freedom of responsibility"" assumes all employees are responsible, dedicated adults who can manage their own timelines."
good,A very diverse group and very hard working. Strong leaders at every level.
good,"I'd did temp work with them and it was a very fun and very enjoyable place to work, I learned the importance of deadlines and rapport building with a team of new people"
good,Working with the animal trainers on Netflix was a real eye-opener whole job career is in the automotive and sandblasting industry so it was a real eye-opener an inspiration to look into a new career opportunity to advance my skills with fabrication
good,"Netflix has a modern, upbeat work atmosphere.  They are accommodating to your outside family life within means.  Most Supervisors/CR1 were approachable and easy to get along with.  Positive environment.  It is a job, so do you work and whats expected of you and its a breeze."
good,"they paid well, but being a call center they critiqued your calls.  which is normal, but a lot of times they would tell you to change but wouldn't tell you what needed to be changed.  sometimes very confusing on what you were expected to do."
good,"excelente empresa me enseño muchas cosas que no sabia "
good,"Top market benefits and great workplace culture based on freedom and responsibility to do whatever you want to do, but with responsibility.  People are encouraged to take risks and fail."
good,"HR is not there to help you in anyway, but will work to get you fired. They will look for ways that you are failing even if you are doing your job well."
good,I love working here but management is not doing there job thats the only down fall
good,My time as an employee for Netflix was truly life-changing. I got my dream job and had the opportunity to get my foot in the door. I learned more about the industry working this job than any class could have ever taught me.
good,"Fue una experiencia increíble. Todos los días contábamos con catering durante todo el día, el ambiente de trabajo era muy agradable y aprendí cosas del mundo audiovisual."
good,"I moved to Hollywood to be able to participate in the Hollywood Script Option meetings. I am grateful to be able to have my true life stories and children's stories optioned for consideration by Netflix animation producers. Thank you for brining to life, The Adventures of Christian Combs & Victor Michini, Sean Combs, The Paper Boy and The Player of Crossline Towers."
good,I enjoy myself working for them it is a place to work for and not stress at all it kind of hurted when they relocated and i got alone with all the employees
good,I was an extra in a netlfix original film and it was really interesting to see. Netlfix are a global company that I found fascinating to see it from a film
good,Great workplace for an amazing award winning show. I can't wait for the next season. The actors are incredibly nice and the crew is really productive to work with
good,"good culture of work, benefits, salary. very nice team of workers."
good,Working for Netflix was an amazing experience for me in developing my skills for the next level. They really promoted growth and development within its teams.
good,"It was the same thing most days working at Netflix, but the environment was amazing! Everyone here is so friendly and it was very easy to reach out. I had learned so much from this job that it made me more confident about working here!"
good,"Great place to work, great benefits, competitive pay, great atmosphere."
good,I loved my time at Netflix. They really cared about all of us and made what we did fun. We played games and won prizes. They made sure we were taken care of with free or discounted food and drinks. They provided the best health benefits I have ever seen.
good,I learned a lot about big scale production. The days were long but the people were all kind and professional. Great experience.
good,"This was one of the coolest jobs I have ever worked.  The process of sending and receiving DVDs in the mail was cool.  You will work hard, no slacking needed in this place."
good,One of the best companies to work for. I really enjoyed working with the supervisor and the coworkers. The hours where great and the work was a joy.
good,This job taught me a lot how to work in a fast paced environment effectively.  My co-workers and manager all were their to encourage each other and get the job done.
good,"Great Training program, fun place to work with management that was there to help you learn and grow with the company, They worked hard to get employees the schedules they wanted."
good,"You will definitely be in shape working here! It is non-stop from when you clock in, to when you leave! Hard job for a family person. Not too much family time, due to the hours."
good,The was a customer support job at a call center in hillsboro. A really fun and entertaining environment! Plus a free Netflix account!
good,Worked in a laid-back environment to sort through and inspect DVDs.
good,"•Consult to ensure the best online user-interface experience"
good,putting covers in a movie case and also the disk in the case and giving them to the next person
good,great place to work construction. always got paid on time. straight to the point boss.
good,Mostly help customers with their service and answer any questions they might have regarding Netflix.
good,"The work day started very early but also ended earlier in the day which allowed more time during the day to run errands. Management was very fair and the co workers were very easy to work with, I learned a lot a new skills with running machinery and worked independently without needing direction."
good,I enjoyed the work we shipped and received DVDs' I loved my co workers
good,falta de identidad corporativa pero empresa de flujo monetario creciente
good,recibir llamadas mas por cuestión de facturación  lo que aprendí es en como atender a los clientes tener una manera sencilla y clara de como hablarles
good,"It was a very upbeat place to work; our floor managers were constantly available for assistance, further knowledge and to keep our spirits up. Everyone was very patient, considerate and kind; always offering advice to help the newer employee's find their feet."
good,Day to day we had to take incoming calls and help troubleshoot problems of callers. A great smooth child work vibe to some of the stress of our shoulders from certain callers.
good,"Netflix had the most fun culture of any job I have worked at, and if you get in with the right people, you can advance pretty quickly. the downside was the politics. If you were not in with the management, you will work the same position for years and never see advancement no matter how good you are"
good,"Hard work and long hours. Netflix was a high producing company and only kept the best of the best, meaning they treated there employees as contractors so output was required to keep working there and to keep your job. It's a fun environment if your able to keep up, but just keep that in mind, the Netflix culture is not for everyone looking for a stable salary and job in a non competitive job environment"
good,"While the corporate stance is they do not tolerate ""Brilliant jerks"" but in reality they are tolerated as long as they don't irritate the management. The best part of the job was the freedom as long as you color within the lines. You are allowed to assist with other teams that allows you to learn more than just your specific job."
good,"Very team oriented, our site was site of the month for one year straight. managers were caring although not all were very dependable. Main negative aspect of working for 24-7 Intouch was there insistence on advancement in the company but never having availability and actually had layoffs instead."
good,Great company they just went out of business to no fault of mine. Had to sell out to Sprint and Direct TV. Fun environment to work in. Just wish the CEO made better decisions regarding the company's future.
good,"A fun, great business culture. Laid back. get to work on movies titles in the entertainment industry. Coworkers are all nerdy movie geeks, or video games nerds."
good,"En si es un trabajo light, atender a clientes con tranquilidad y tiempo lo único malo es que a veces son muy necios y eso provoca que te tardes en las llamadas o que peleen contigo sin ser el culpable jaja"
good,"the problem with working on set for a tv show is that as an actor, (unless you are the lead) there's an excellent chance you don't work all the time. This kind of instability is common in the acting profession and a reason why many actors, like myself, have other 'gigs' we do when not being used on set. I absolutely loved working on the show, but it was cancelled after a recent acquisition by Disney and now i'm looking for a more stable working environment."
good,Essa empresa foi a minha primeira experiência profissional...Só tenho a agradecer foi ai que aprendir muita coisa sobre comportamento etica
good,Overall good work place just can be a little more balanced in being organized. The hardest part is dealing with customers that dont want to listen to the result in there problem to be fixed
good,"Netflix always took good care of us. we had catered lunches at least every couple of months, great benefits, great pay. We answered phone calls from customers that wanted to make payments or had issues with dvds or streaming."
good,"Managed up to eight employees and provided training of all new Customer Service representatives.  Responsible for data entry on all calls, work orders, starting & ending assignments and issues into a SQL database; supervised inventory weekly, monthly, and yearly."
good,I actually loved working here. the pay was good for it being 2008 when i was there. very easy job to do.
good,"Wirking for Netflix covered both ends if the spectrum. On the plus side, the benefits and company itself were great! Flexibility, values, inexpensive insurance, no dress code, etc. "
good,people are very kind and understanding. there is a lot of creative space in the workplace most enjoyable part of the job was that the staff is very supportive and don't hesitate to help out.
good,Loved my first call center job and everyone was very open and knowledgeable on how to make customers feel incredible about the passion of movies. It was a great place to learn
good,"Netflix provides as close to instant gratification for its customers as possible. However,the physical delivery of disks is entirely dependent on postal services and if these change, HUB servicing locations can change. This means positions in these HUBs are not as long-term secure as most people would like."
good,"i cant complain, i may still be there if i hadnt relocated. it was an alright place to work, but there wasnt much room for advancement in my opinion. all in all, i was ok with it"
good,"As a customer service representative the job is pretty predictable and easy as you get used to it. It definitely requires people skills, and some customers are easier to deal with than others. The management team is fair and understanding."
good,I am a big fan of netflix and i got a chance to work for them. Its really good when you like a company and suddenly you get a chance to work with it. and that happens with me. yes i loved netflix as a audience and as a employer also.
good,"Netflix knows exactly what they're doing, very professional and efficient with their work.  I only worked as a PA but I observed a lot and got some really good contacts."
good,"I owe a lot of my personal and professional growth to this company. They certainly take care of their employees on the Corporate level. "
good,"The only downside to working here is that they make decisions regarding things like overnight shifts and call center transfers that dont work with some employees. Otherwise its a fun atmosphere, very relaxed, and everyone is friendly and knows whats up."
good,"Young company and keeps you busy.  On the forefront of the new way of entertainment, so be prepared for moving quickly.  Great team members of all top tier caliber."
good,"Easy going management, knowledgeable management team. Workplace culture-high energy , diverse group age wise. Fast paced. Very flexible schedule for college students, parents, etc."
good,"They train you well. Very hands on. They also have competitions where you can win, Roku devices, iPads, PlayStations. It was a very fun working environment. Definitely miss it."
good,"Working here was great. It is so organized and you know exactly what is expected of you. The training really gets everyone on the same page so as to keep the culture aligned with the goals of the company. The employees are definitely put first, making it really easy to want to do a good job for the company."
good,"fun and peaceful place to work at. friendly and curious, was sad the it went to automated, and only a handful was required  the operated the mechanics"
good,Breeds a healthy work environment. Many incentives to work overtime and around the holidays. Working here helped give me the experience to deal with irate customers who just want their product to work.
good,"Its a morning shift and we normally handled calls about our customer Netflix's account if they have difficulties in getting netflix, billls and payment also inquiries about movies and shows that netflix offers.Netflix always teach us to be friends with our customer for us to create a good customer service. Netfix also provides us excellent working environment, facilities are good we have entertainment rooms were we can watch movies and play during our free time. Best part is learning new things everyday and use it to help my customer with their concerns."
good,"Small group of people to work with."
good,Love waking up to go to work. Very relaxed work environment with flexible seating arrangements. Teams were very intimate and team leads worked with agents one on one week after week to improve in areas that were lacking. For every holiday and new release there was a celebration including food and games.
good,"Contestar llamadas telefónicas, aprendí a tratar con clientes y manejar el estrés, trabajo en equipo. Agredí a desenvolverme, a ser más dinámico, proactivo y trato con los usuarios"
good,"Great company with good values, and synergy oriented, the company encourages inner growth."
good,From the benefits to the pay everything was top of the market. This was the highest paying entry level job near me for awhile. Holiday pay plus a lot of time additional pay or prizes could be awarded for picking up OT.
good,"Netflix was a nice workplace while i was there, co-workers were either very friendly or to themselves which allowed for time to either focus on work or get help very easily for work."
good,"A typical day at Netflix would usually begin at 2:45 A.M and in  most cases around 9:30A.M no later than 10:30 A.M "
good,"Great place to work if you want to continue to push yourself.  Not for everyone, but can be very rewarding.  Get to know people and how the company works.  More context is better."
good,"A really great place to work.  Management was very fair and not on your back all the time.  If one had any issues they would be there to help you. It was a pleasure to work there.  Netflix, is one place I would like to work, again."
good,The best place i've ever worked for. If you need any additional check out the Freedom and Culture deck that's online. You will see that it has one of the best cultures in the world.
good,Love working at Netflix! The pay and benefits are great. They implemented a lot of changes in the time I've been here most fir the better. The culture certainly is changing to a typical call center vibe and room for advancement is small. Very small. It's customer service so you must have immense patience and people skills.
good,"Netflix offers excellent benefits and pay, scheduling flexibility, and a great culture. I started out at a 40 Hour work week, but they were able to work with me to develop a customized schedule based on my school schedule. The best part about the job is being part of a company that cares about you personally. The worst part is probably just the job itself. Netflix is a really simple system, so you get calls from people who can't use computers for the most part. It can be stressful."
good,"The center is closing and this job is no longer available."
good,"Customer service support, learning new technology and teaching about it also.."
good,A typical morning for me was overlooking the rest of the Customer Service Team and making sure everything got resolved in a timely manner from any customer whether good or bad. Also I got to train new employees as well so I was kept very busy during my work time.
good,"we stared at 4:00am this is yhe hardest part of the job, the managger was very punctual she wont everybody arrived on time. The co-workers was very funny and hard workers,"
good,Working freelance with them made me feel like part of something bigger. a really neat company to work for. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the streaming space.
good,"This has been hands down the best job I've ever had.  No uniform, flexible schedule,  and the culture that values diversity, innovation, inclusion, integrity,  and judgement.  I made real changes that improved not only my fellow coworkers experience but customers as well. This job taught me what respect and transparency in the workplace looks like."
good,I loved loved loved working there but they left Texas. Gave me the opportunity to move to Colorado with the company but I could not move unfortunately.
good,I am a seasoned HR professional yet learned so much in my four years at Netflix.  They were willing to move employees in different positions if they believed in you;  Appreciatde it!
good,"Everyday the Netflix company bought us breakfast and lunch  the best thing is that target had two big amazing kitchen that provided all kind of snacks and drinks "
good,"Netflix took great care of their employees and provided a great workplace. Nice campus, great peers and people that you get to work with, great customers and not too difficult of calls to take."
good,"Great culture, not only on paper."
good,great diverse and family oriented company to work for with.  Would have loved to work with the company longer.  The hardest part of the job was being laid-off.
good,"Netflix is a fantastic company who pays competitively, rewards great work, and focuses on innovation and creating an amazing product and experience for members."
good,"This is the best company I've worked for just for the simple fact they hire, top talent, treat employees like adults (with respect and honesty), and in return, expect hard work. Hard work doesn't mean long hours, since that's up to you. With the unlimited time off policy, I can come in, expect to work 8 hours, but if an emergency comes in, I can leave at a moment's notice and stay out as long as I need, all while getting paid."
good,"Early morning hours, complete automation, The hardest part of my job is working with people who don't want to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting off early on Fridays and not having to be back until 2:00 AM on Monday."
good,"i worked with great people .and great leadership "
good,"Netflix is a great place to work for those tenacious, hard working, get the job done performers."
good,I loved this job and the people. I wish netflix didnt close the campaign here. Def a great company to work for telus and netflix
good,"Build the Ad Ops Department from the ground up, implemented a new ad server to the site coordinating with Engineering.  Tagged all pages, implemented new io's, hired sales people, trafficked all IO's, campaign management, reporting."
good,It was  a  Great  Company  I love The  Inspecting the Dvds  and  stuff  good  pay  and  service
good,"I worked there for 5 years, when i start, i was an associate, and when I left i was a supervisor, Netflix encourages growth and learning to all its employees, quite a life experience."
good,"Best job i had in all honesty. Very helpful staff, along with great benefits and flexible schedules, made this a awesome place to work at. If the company was still here, i would still be working there."
good,Being surrounded by stunning colleagues is the most motivating aspect of Netflix's culture as everyone brings their A-game which generates very healthy debate and motivates everyone to do even better work.
good,"I would probably still be working at Netflix if they did not move their call center away from Oregon. I may have moved locations if I did not have prior commitments that kept me in Oregon. They offered any employees a moving stipend. Upper management was as transparent as they could be to their customer service team. Some of the best direct managers and site managers I've had worked there when I did. There was always room for internal growth if you put the work in. The only downside was dealing with situations that did not involve the company. Since the service needs things like internet and electronic devices to function, irritation was often directed towards customer service when the issue was elsewhere."
good,"Work began for me at 4:00 am and concluded at around 10:00am  or 11:00am.  Management was excellent.  It was hard to leave this job, but they invented a machine to replace us all."
good,Loved it the pay was more than fair the pto and sick days were abundant and it was set up for success I just couldn’t work anymore because of a family illness
good,Netflix is an amazing place to work. They care about their employees. The pay is fair and they offer an amazing benefits package. You also get ample PTO and emergency time.
good,"Netflix was an amazing place to work. They always had little bonuses for us, flexible work hours, management was always friendly and helpful. There was much opportunity for growth and managers were willing to help you excel."
good,"Overall Great experience to work for post."
good,"loved working at Netflix, the benefits were great and so were management. My position was eliminated so I left to find something else. I enjoyed my time there and am happy I had the experience I left with."
good,"Tuve solo un inconveniente con una persona en Netflix, lo que me ahorilla a renunciar, el Coordinador Gabriel se concentra tanto en su trabajo que la enfermedad de un empleado le afecta a el."
good,"Awesome company to work for.  We worked hard and always celebrated our successes, The company lives by its core values, and if your and average employee, you wont be working there long.  They search for the most talented individuals to join their team, and together we accomplish great things."
good,"very strict attendance policy but its fairly easy going if you apply yourself, pretty much if you can hold a decent conversation with a stranger this is the job for you."
good,"Netflix was a great place to work, the environment was very relaxed and easy going, management was great to work with, training was very thorough. The only thing I did not like was shift bids happened very often. While this is not something that the company could avoid due to being so new and not at capacity, it was very difficult to find one that could accommodate personal life. The hardest part of the job was speaking with customer's who didn't quite understand what was needing to be done, but even then, that was still easy. And that is what I mean that the environment is great, even the hardest or most difficult part of the job is still easy."
good,This is the most easiest and funnest jobs I have ever worked for.
good,"This career opens up several doors for advancement, Unfortunately for myself the hours are the only issue. This is a wonderful and dynamic environment to work within as well as family directed."
good,"Netflix makes you feel at home even though your at work, They build your skills by daily and weekly coaching!"
good,"Early mornings, everyone knows their jobs, a great bunch of people to work with and for."
good,"es un empleo my bueno ya que el salario es excelente y el ambiente aun mas."
good,"They give great instruction, information and attention to you. They work with you with ease, non stressful at all, absolutely lovely team who made sure you have everything you need, including food during breaks."
good,"The Netflix culture is a one of a kind.  Great benefits/pay.  Freedom, and Resposibility.  Great support from all areas.  Teamwork is required to make things happen."
good,"Fun workplace, friendly environment, family and goal oriented. You get the feeling of being apart of a family more than just a regular team. Loved working here, relocation cause me to resign."
good,"Netflix is amazing! I loved the culture, the energy, the people, and miss it everyday. More companies need to take Netflix's lead when it comes to culture."
good,Working here is unlike any other career. The people and the dynamics are a combination for success. Here you will be pushed to your boundaries and challenge existing ideas.
good,"I learned more about how to conduct myself as a leader, and grow to accept feedback, how to be more inclusive. How to speak and write better, and overall how to be a true professional in the workplace thanks to being surrounded by such excellent leaders."
good,"Free insurance, free food, awsome people to work with, amazing culture, early work hours. Got to travel to different locations and help out.  Every one knows every one"
good,"If you are up for constant challenges and opportunities for growth, Netflix is for you. It is not a place where you can just sit and be comfy, but that is why I love it. We solve big challenges on a daily basis and I wouldn't have it any other way. It is has one of the strongest cultures I've ever been a part of and I've been in quite a few notable places. Success isn't measured in tenure, but in impact. I started as a team of 1 and have increased my impact to the business and now lead a team of 75+. If you're great at what you do and you love new challenges, Netflix is for you. If you want something cushy to just sit back and cash a check, don't bother. The Netflix culture either excites you or scares you. There really isn't a middle ground."
good,Can’t complain my bosses were pretty amazing. I worked in pre production and I gained valuable experience as well as life lessons about the industry and just job experience in general.
good,"Love my job, call center enviroment, free food. employees very supportive and friendly same with managers. very comfortable enviroment. hard part just dealing with sometimes diffcult customers, but just basic customer service you can be yourself nothing scripted."
good,"My experience with 24-in touch (Netflix) was great. "
good,"they made sure we ate had breaks rides everything."
good,"At Netflix, they do their best to eliminate any stressors or needs so that you can focus on your work. They provide meals and snacks, computer aid, convenient/comfortable work environments and a bunch of other great things."
good,"Entertainment, like friendship, is a fundamental human need; it changes how we feel and gives us common ground. Netflix is better entertainment at lower cost and greater scale than the world has ever seen. We want to entertain everyone, and make the world smile."
good,worked there for 16 years. I worked there when it first got started. worked my way up from a regular operator to becoming a manager. Loved this company. great with their employees.
good,Wish I were still working there today. CSR1 position can be demanding but offers the most job security and they train you to do it all. Management seems to be constantly changing but doesn't really affect you doing your job receiving a paycheck and going home or overtime.
good,I worked on Atypical for Netflix and had a very great experience interacting with them. As a new media company there is room for growth within the company.
good,"this job was 1 of my favorites, we had different times of the day where we would get to spin the winning wheel and win stuff, we were always acknowledged for our achievements."
good,I definitely recommend this job! I wish I didn’t have to relocate I really miss working for Netflix. The benefits were amazing and the environment was so positive!
good,I enjoyed the relaxed work atmosphere and the onsite activities. I also enjoyed working on some of the holidays as the events were catered. We also got to enjoy free netflix while being employed with the company.
good,this was the best job ever. Hate they had to leave Memphis. I learn to drive truck with this job. This job was flexible with my every day life. I had the best team did not have any complaints. We inspect order and process the thru machine.
good,"You want to work there. The people are great, the culture is great. I had to leave due to some family issues and needing to relocate but I would have stayed if possible."
good,Me encanto haber sido participe de un excelente equipo conformado por la supervisora Diana!
good,"Okay, this is literally one of the best jobs you will ever have. The work load is easy, the employees are incredibly nice, and there are so many perks! They're always throwing parties, they have a gym, it has it's own legitimate café and store. It's wonderful."

good,"The chat portion of working for Netflix was amazing, I helped launch the opening in Denver,Co. It was the best culture for a work place, we didn't have a scripted and could honestly help the customer."
good,"This place was the Best Job I've ever had."
good,Great place to work except for a couple of supervisors. Overall the work experience was great and learned a lot on how to hustle on the phones and provide good customer service.
good,Netflix was moving very aggressively when we came aboard- I've always been thoroughly impressed. We've had the space to be assertive in creating culture.
good,"Working for the Netflix campaign was a great experience. I enjoyed working with my coworkers because everyone helped each other out in anyway they could, from, one on one help to help from the entire staff. Even when the staff was on break and couldn't afford something to eat, someone helped that person with something to eat."
good,"Netflix is the epitome of a big call center.  If you like talking on the phone, and love helping others, this is the place for you.  They give you a free Netflix account and tons of free food in the break rooms."
good,assisting netflix members with there netflix ready devices which requires technical feedback. Also account maintenance but mst priority leaning on delivering amazing customer experience so that can drive great metrics. The other thing i admire is team meetings and individual meetings with supervisors t enhance team chemistry and self success.
good,"My experience at Netflix was enriching as far as my knowledge is concerned. The requirements were well documented and I could fix the issues in the desired time. Later, I had to do a knowledge transfer which was an easy process too. "
good,"Netflix was a great company to work for they were very good to their employees, a great environment around the call center, very integrated in how they teach,"
good,"I have worked for many companies in the course of my professional career. By far, Netflix  was the best. Quality of people, Comp, etc, were excellent."
good,Netflix was a awesome place to work at. You got to help so many people with there problems and make them happy. The employees and managers were very easy to work with. We also had TV's every where and a awesome break room to eat and relax
good,netflix came through at a time when i was in need of something clutch and it provided me with something that I would be able to maintain for the time being. Due to my site being shut down I'm unemployed but its still gucci within netflix with me
good,love the work hours peaceful work environment great co-workers awesome pay plus benefits great supervisors always willing to work with you when your in need of help.

good,"Great managent relaxed atmosphere,  great trainers,  plenty of opportunity for growth within the company. Their staff really loves and cares about their workers, and they're very friendly,  but about the business as well."
good,This place is really great they teach you the skills you will need thoroughly. The work environment is unsurpassed the benefits the offer for the day to day work are great and the medical and dental are the best ive seen plus for the expecting parents the benefits there are unheard of but fantastic. The leadership actually leads they guide you on how you can improve in your job and help better prepare you for that promotion. The people that work there are friendly and helpful the hardest part about gaining advice from the other workers there is just asking and figuring out what question it is that you need answered. Overall I would work there again if i didn't have to start at the customer service level really 5 stars does this employer no justice.
good,"Received inbound phone calls from customers needing help with their gaming devices, and their new TVs. I learned how to communicate over the phone over the ways of fixing computers, gaming devices, and Tvs. The management was changing to make the work environment more successful and positive. The culture was very fun, loving, and humorous. The hardest part of the job was giving quick, precise directions to the older generation over the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was using my teaching skills and interacting with customers over the phone about enjoying the entertainment they can stream on netflix."
good,Netflix had a lot of benefits to my family. Their communication and culture was great to be in. Everyone was so nice and respectful to others. In some way it helped my family enjoy watching T.V.

good,"Que puedes ayudar a cualquiera y cambiarle el día. Personas que no tienen a nadie para que los ayuden, se comunicaban con nosotros para brindarles la mano, ayudarles a que sigan disfrutando de su película favorita."
good,"Autonomy, great compensation and the opportunity to work with the best of the best.  This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Only problem is they spoil you and makes it impossible to find anything else that compares!"
good,This is definitely a great and fun place to work. I love video games and tech so working at this call center was really fun. Getting to know new releases and playing with the different devises that you could load the app onto
good,Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved. I learned that it's easier to sympathize with a customer than to argue. Hardest part about the job is staying confident in yourself when you have angry customers criticizing you for mistakes that may have been on their part. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and creating new friendships.
good,"Great Company to work for really takes care of their employees."
good,"Taking on a queue of thousands of calls on a daily basis taught me patience and fast problem solving skills, both are things I carry with me each day. It was a really team player type of environment I had the chance to work closely with management daily which taught me leadership skills. The most enjoyable part of my job here had to be talking to my customers giving them a great experience with each call made my day."

This is a place where you can literally be yourself, not feel judged, and just have an amazing time at work. They teach you, uplift you, and help you reach your goals in all aspects. I have learned so many things, and I am happy that I was able to work their because I think they have made me a better person overall, and I can take the skills that I learned there, and put them into my life."

Be an active listener who can show empathy and patience. Work in a fast paced, high volume, changing, and non-scripted environment while learning and strives to gain new knowledge about product and service changes."

good,- Get the task list from supervisor
good,"Ambiente de trabajo relajado, light, con mucho soporte personal"
good,"Typical work week would be very busy. Traveled about 90% of the year. Out on Mondays and usually back by Fridays of the same week. Work had to be done quickly due to daily production goals. I learned that I had to work quickly and efficiently to achieve the company goal which is to get DVDs out on a timely manner everyday. Co-workers were great. Upper management were very knowledgeable in production, but not in service, so that's where the maintenance crew came in. Hardest part of the job was the travel and having to have finished all the work required before coming home, or else I don't come home until the job was done. (Not usually an issue with me cause I always get the job done). The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always a challenge. No two day were the same and I was always upj for anything."
