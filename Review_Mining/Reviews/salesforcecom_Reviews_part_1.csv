rating,review
bad,"Thing 5 was not my favorite place to work, 15 year old start up that couldn't get their ideas and vision together, management style was fear and intimidation"
bad,"Management was petty, condescending, arrogant, and childish. Insinuations were made regarding females and their role in the IT work place and quite frankly, I regret every second I spent there."
bad,I’ve been in Support for over 4 years. Very tough to get a promotion or internal transfer. Work culture is one of fear and aversion to innovation. Multiple people are leaving due to lack of career advancement opportunities in Support.
bad,Young/liberal. The product is too big and complicated for the average business. It is really stupid how how they buy into their own B.S. Many companies are dropping their contract with Salesforce. Cut-throat.
bad,"Infrastucture was great the facilities provided in the office were good "
bad,"When I got the opportunity in, I am very excited. But with such a poor management team, I don't know what is the future of the employees. Job security is very low in Salesforce, you never know when you get pink slip and you don't know why they are giving it."
bad,"-Lack of strong high level leadership"
bad,"Awful. Felt like high school. Cut throat environment, manager would belittle peers in front of you, so you know they did the same about you when you weren't around. You're only allowed to log 40 hours a week but work closer to 60. Volunteer opportunities are ""voluntary"" but you get criticized if you don't do them."
bad,Basically good ideas for a workplace... unfortunately filled with quite immature people who form little cliques and bully others even on their own team.
bad,"Salesforce is one of the best place to work. Good working environment, good people and excellent management structure. It is a great privilege to work in such a company."
bad,I do not choose to comment on my employment at this time. Salesforce is my current employer and I am currently open to new opportunities in the bay area.
bad,"Long hours, toxic culture in CSG, no advancement. Good teams to work with for the most part, but don't expect management to support your advancement goals. Only concerned about themselves."
bad,"A typical day at work feels like being chained to a desk. Management has little to no attachment to employees."
bad,"Very bad Institute"
bad,"Salesforce is changing. Some things for the good like the amazing office spaces, especially in hub cities where there is a ""Tower"" building. The views, environment, as well as amenities on those top floors and throughout the building is very good by any standard."
bad,The team was in turmoil but the management was very supportive. A lot of politics going on in HR but great benefits and interesting job. The CEO is amazing in giving back to the community
bad,I worked at Marketing Dimensions.  Liked the people that I worked with. I was hired after staying home with my children for 12 years.  Great start into the work force
bad,"Great product and some great people. The culture is cut throat.  Management changes frequently providing it hard to get consistency.  Very quick to go to market on new features, often before the staff understand what this means and how to explain it to customers.  There are some very smart people with great ideas.  The innovativeness is great.  I would recommend reviewing and perfecting the products you have on the shelf before releasing something new."
bad,"Salesforce still has a great name in job market, but it is mainly based on what it used to be to work there. Today, the environment is very stressful, focused on driving results every month, and pushing customers in multiple ways to rush their decisions, and we have to make an effort to add clouds if by any means possible."
bad,"When I was at Salesforce I notified my boss that my Mom was moved to hospice and would die within a day or 2, he expressed his sympathy and then told me that when I get back into the office he wanted me to take 2 more scrum teams.  Days later when I told my boss that my Mom had passed away, he reiterated how sorry he was, recommended I ""make myself scarce"" for the rest of the week and reminded me that he wanted me to take 2 more scrum teams when I got back into the office."
bad,"Its getting harder and harder to hit their board mandated number each year, as such the wheels have begun to fall off even at HQ. Fantastic company to work with as long as you aren't in sales. Otherwise, it is very challenging and unless you have a corporate brand you can uphold even under the worst pressure of your life with terrible managers, you will struggle. Good luck!"
bad,"Hyderabad management does not understand the effort that each employee is putting, as a result, there are many experience folks quit the Org. But still, they are not realizing."
bad,"No growth opportunities in India. No a great paymaster either."
bad,"a typical day at work is manageable, Co workers are good helpful"
bad,"Support department is run like a Sales department with cut throat culture and obscene, unrealistic metrics to obtain.  Focus is not on helping the customer , but rather jumping through a number of hoops to obtain the metrics necessary for management to see on their Dashboards.  Work/Life balance gets a lot of lip service, but everyone knows is a joke.  Stress and overtime are a constant."
bad,"Organized"
bad,Very demanding atmosphere that was mainly numbers driven. Depending on what patch of territory or base of accounts could determine your future of accelerated growth or monthly struggle. Strong product but not for every customer mainly due to price. Very competitive culture and industry.
bad,La salaire est bon mais la culture m'a laisse de marbre
bad,"My personal executive was an inspiration to me and others in the org.  The hours were very long and work life balance not respected.  High turnover, the global hours were grueling.  Lack of advancement."
bad,overall average environment;  very busy;  not so much time to learn anything new; not much guidance;  caseload is very high;  coworkers are not helpful
bad,Good employee benefits but no work life balance especially morning shifts. Management never acknowledge employees concern. Hectic pressures situation. No breaks you will get from 9 AM - 6AM sometimes you can't take your lunch.
bad,"•	Analyzing, organizing and entering data through SAP to maintain transactional accounts within Axalta."
bad,"Salesforce is a good place to work. And trust me, they tell everyone about it. "
good,Nothing specific to write about the organisation as it has been a challenging assignment with learning all the new process and there lot of reluctance to share knowledge
good,Lots of travel with no reward. No partners to deliver solutions and no sales engineers to drive deals. Product set was not managed well and customers fell through the cracks. Management was non-existent. Co-workers just going through the motions. Hardest part of the job was convincing people on the value of the platform. Most enjoyable part of the job was working close to home.
good,"No work/life balance. Get guilt tripped or fired if you use your PTO. High annual projected salary, but barely ever paid commissions. Maybe a different department would be a different experience."
good,Great people and a variety of teams to work with. Management needs leadership help. Lots of workers changing teams due to seniority with no experience. Team does not take new perspectives and feedbacks into consideration.
good,"A great place to start off learning Salesforce.com."
good,This job could keep you up at nights depending on which department you are working in. Overall the company compensates you great but has found very stressful methods to keep employee on their toes.
good,"As a result, when you grow things change.  I just didn't expect it to change as it did or counter to what made them successful, in my view."
good,"fast paced, competitive culture. Great exposure to entire P&L."
good,"High Performance Environment with fuzzy metrics and kpis. Results driven, must meet numbers at any cost even at the risk of burnout. Many great perks and benefits. No clear career pathing. People are both great and terrible depending on role/dept."
good,Great experience!  Company is great at promoted the product to customers.  Made great money but paid a price.  Very stressful with monthly quota.  Know what you are getting in to.
good,"Despite all the hype about Salesforce, there can be a large disparity of responsibility. Some teams had time to spend doing volunteer work during the work day and playing pool or ping pong in the lounge. I didn't have those luxuries. So a positive experience is dependent on the team. Also, if your management team is located in a different city, then you are at greater risk for a negative work experience."
good,I think Salesforce is a great company for what it stands for in cloud commuting.  Only constructive feedback that may turn people away is that the contractors are not treated equally as their full time employees.
good,"Working for this company brings me a lot of pride, I what Salesforce does in the SAAS field is fantastic in so many ways. "
good,"What began as a start up culture has turned into a large corporation that continues to acquire companies  and competition. Although macroautonomy can be nice, it's difficult to manage up in a matrix role with fairly often reorgs and turnover. Don't spend more than 2 years there unless you want to climb the ladder."
good,"Excellent company in terms of structures it has set up, great benefits, voluntary contributions etc. Very high growth targets meaning hiring extensively and a lot of people lack depth of knowledge on the product and company. Lot's of new and inexperienced managers who cannot handle pressure and create negative and intense working environment. Lot's of unnecessary stress and pressure! Not as good as it's hyped up to be due to certain managers. Other teams say it's great so it really depends on the team you are in and the manager you have!"
good,"Unless you know someone e hard to break in.  Stock up people .. "
good,"Ohana, this means extended family in Hawaii. After being at Salesforce for the past two years, this is anything but a ""family"" environment. This company is as cutthroat as any other software company."
good,"Pacsuntech Solutions helps its Global customers remain at the vanguard of their industries with pioneering uses of technology to operate their businesses more competently. We deliver flexible, custom Information Technology and Business Process outsourcing solutions that improve quality and reduce costs. We explore, develop, identify and adapt new ways to achieve this objective. Our objective and priorities are substantially distinct from our competition. Having good Experience at  pacsuntech solution pvt.ltd."
good,"Great co-workers, fun environment. "
good,"was ok place to work.  Management kind of disorganized."
good,Some co-workers nice & some not so nice
good,"SFDC is very competitive place to spend your time within your sales careers.  The opportunities are far less than years ago and that isn't slowing down.  It's a very stressful environment and it's getting harder and harder to even make your number based on the size of the territories and the comp plan.  Big swings, big loses."
good,Tough business trying to sell Salesforce to new enterprise customers as everyone knows the company and the product - I was once told by a senior executive that one of the most important pieces of sales strategy needed to be successful was ...Luck
good,Salesforce has an interesting created culture that takes some time to adjust to.  It can be super high-stress at times but that balances to a certain bit with opportunities.  It's a great place to learn.
good,"I'm very happy to have at worked at Salesforce for as long as I have - over 3 years now.  However the company and culture has changed and unless you're under 28 or new to sales, and trying to get some experience at a splashy resume name - stay away."
good,"The first 4 years of Salesforce was amazing. Then, the focus was on revenue and utilization and not helping customers. Making my last 2 years not as enjoyable."
good,I was a contractor while the Sales Compensation Manager went on maternity leave.  I was schedule to stay for 6 months but was extended to 12 months.  It was a good place to work.
good,"Salesforce is a fantastic place to work right out of college, but it's not geared towards professional business people. Age discrimantion is the norm and the culture is more like a frat house than a corporation. The company is always hiring due to the massive amount of turn over."
good,"Some ppl make it, some ppl don't. Some territories catch fire, some stay cold. Some managers are much less militaristic, some are more. Doesn't matter what the issue may be there is someone underneath you working themselves to the bone for a shot at your spot. Targets are high and difficult to deliver on. Not for the faint-hearted."
good,"Nice feeling to not be micromanaged, but their is politics within the company. Very fast paced, always something to do or someone to help. Days go by fast and rarely bored."
good,"FLC Recruiting for Technical roles, see resume for futher details."
good,"The company provides a good work environment and facilities. Management is very supportive, like salary credit on time, food facility for nightshift people, etc."
good,it was a fun experience working at sales force.. high self motivated energy  type stuff. always trying to make it fun.. but management could have done better work.
good,"Incredibly demanding yet equally rewarding company to work for, fun culture with plenty of opportunity for grown within the company. Working remotely can be challenging to connect with HQ"
good,"Easy day to day activity, Non- Profit. The most enjoyable part of the organization are the people. Management can use some work. No sense of Culture. I have learn new skills from employees."
good,"Learned a lot about SaaS computing.  Great training, lots of parties, and you got to run you territory as if you were CEO. "
good,"•	Have ability to Multi-task, develop complex functionalities using apex programming and visual force pages, face & overcome critical challenges with ease. Project problem resolution on time and solution design skills and analyzing skills to meet deadlines, have been appreciated by the Clients many times."
good,"Contrary to popular believe working here feels like nothing special.  In IT, the management seems detached, roles are often unclear (at least in my experience) and business partners are hard charging.   I have found it hard to feel inspired or wowed.  "
good,"I Have Strong Knowledge on Sales Force Concepts.. Like Ape, Visual Force, Validation Rules, Workflows, Tirggers.. etc"
good,"Good company, a bit scattered as far as management, but overall would work there again."
good,Hard werken waarbij cijfers tellen
good,"Working in Salesforce's Commerce Cloud Support team, there were a severe number of Management-related issues that were addressed by numerous employees and had no resolution or further discussion engaged by the Management team."
good,"You can switch to any department if you are good at something, place to grow in your career, some good policies on company side."
good,"Salesforce company culture, benefits, work/life balance and flexibility are pretty good.  There are certain areas within Salesforce that are much better than others (R&D/product side of the house, HR, etc) seem to be run very well, care about their employees and have great career development in place.  IT, has the same benefits, but lacks both the career growth/development opportunities, and positive management.  I'd suggest if you are considering Salesforce and are technical go to R&D and steer clear of IT.  Otherwise, loved the culture and environment."
good,Nice place to work for the culture but not for growth and development.  Management selected favorites and promoted them.
good,"Positive atmosphere"
good,"Good Salesforce product company, where most of the clients from US, so had a very good exposure to Salesforce productive knowledge."
good,"Good place to work for the culture.  Not overly cult like, and felt like the company advanced the greater good of society.  In the financial areas, high work load due to lots of meeting, and fixed deadlines.  Somewhat political.  You can work hard, but you will be recognized more quickly and gain more opportunities if your bosses like your personality as well as your work.  Not always fair, and that bias is in every work place, but more pronounced at SFDC.  Especially in F&S."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you really like sales productivity software, which most people would find rather bland. Well-crafted and well-planned PR/marketing (see:Dreamforce) makes the company and its product seem like it's saving the world, when Salesforce is really profit and numbers-driven company and also works with many companies that are not exactly in the ""saving the world"" camp. The company is huge, and there's a lot of self-congratulatory marketing and PR being pushed down from on high all the time. Lots of companies also acquired without their people being fully on-board with the product and way of working."
good,"Hardest part of job = no mentoring, no training."
good,"This place is a great place to work, but expectations are high and, and coworkers are among the best and brightest in the world."
good,"As with many companies that grow so quickly, the culture has been diluted and employees take a back seat to profit and sales. The company will need to be mindful of retaining managers that are ruthless in the treatment of their employees."
good,"If you want to innovate, don't go here. Start your own company and get bought. "
good,"Salesforce.com is a very fast-paced environment, and a leader in cloud computing."
good,Great Company to work for. Some pros and cons just like any other Company. My current management is great and very supportive in my interests and growth.
good,"This is a great place to work and the culture is amazing."
good,Very nice work -life balance. Nice people to work with. Cool offices. People are fun. Very fun culture..... This is fun! Nothing bad to say.
good,"Great platform. I have worked on it less than a year ( a few months) ."
good,"The CEO has established a great culture around philanthropy, innovation,"
good,My favorite thing about working at Salesforce was the way they gave back via volunteering. Salesforce has a foundation with a list of great organizations you can volunteer. They made it so easy they even pay you to take the time to give back if your doing it doing work hours! Amazing I say!
good,"Great people, and benefits. Really poor management, and spending. Poor alignment of talent with work. You won't be heard unless you have been there 5 years or are a Sr. VP."
good,"Wonderful place to work"
good,I would Image 6 Mac laptops within a day for new hires. Worked with other techs to make sure that all tickets have been updated within 24hours. I learned alot about the casper Imaging system for Macintosh computers and also Imaging Linux on HP Desktop computers.
good,"I never worked for SalesForce, I used Salesforce when I was representing Schutt Sports as a time management assistant. Schutt Sports had all of their sales reps use it to help make notes on meetings, set up appointments."
good,"Great and inclusive culture"
good,Salesforce is too metric driven.  We find that instead of focusing on giving our customers complete service we have to rush to meet numbers.  This also stifles learning.
good,"Please note that my time at Salesforce was a contractor. In many ways it was one of the best jobs I've ever had, but it definitely wasn't perfect. I don't regret one moment there, though I wish some things would have gone differently."
good,They are a great company to work for and their products are the best in the market.  Be prepared to work hard and long as they are all focused on being successful
good,"i have continue working sfdc developer 14hours per day"
good,Excellent products and Service and outstanding value.  Very client focused but also very focused on providing work- life balance.  Rapid growth is taking its toll on long time employees who are having trouble adjusting to different culture.
good,"It started as a radian6 company and then was bought by SFDC.  They are a large company and C levels rarely came around.  The job was ok, manager was great, people were awesome. "
good,"Att jobba i den egna plattformen och därmed skapa bästa förutsättningar för att marknadsföra och sälja den egna produkten."
good,I took this position with the hopes of having a better defined career path. A typical day in Platinum support revolved around fixing client issues. Training for using the tools in Platinum support was not well defined and left some of the new hires flailing when it came to supporting client needs. I was there for over a year and still did not feel like I know what was going on.
good,"Salesforce is a fantastic company. It wins awards for good reason. The values are truly embodied, the work-life balance is real (for my department in Customer Success), the innovation is exciting, and the benefits are great. "
good,"Salesforce has a long list of values that it attempts to instill in employees.  These are valuable things that may be new to most software developers, such as mindfulness, well-being, empathy."
good,My project was a solo project but I was in the same environment as other teams and while my manager was remote it felt like I was included in every. Company facilities were fantastic.
good,The company is exciting and quickly growing both organically and through acquisition. There are an increasing number of opportunities in multiple locations.
good,"Salesforce offers many benefits and opportunities if you choose to pursue them but career opportunities varies greatly depending on your level and department. Real Estate and Workplace services in San Francisco was known to be a toxic culture in the middle of a top rated company. Still, there are many opportunities to learn, grow your career and network. Hopefully the culture of this department will recognize the issues being voiced and address them so it can keep up with the reasons other departments name it one of the best workplaces."
good,"please work hard to keep the poisonous corporate culture out of Salesforce. managers are maneuvering politically, people are being fired for subjective reasons."
good,"My two years at Salesforce were mostly enjoyable, I learned a huge amount during my time there and the culture was fun and motivating. As with a lot of larger companies it was often difficult not to feel like a small fish in a very large pond. Particularly in Sales it was often difficult to achieve targets and results whilst simultaneously abiding by the many rules of engagement. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with prospects (most of the time!) and working with such a fun, energetic team."
good,"Sometimes its too much work that its Hard to Balance work and personal life. Other than that, i really enjoy working in the company. "
good,"I utilized the Salesforce platform while working for the charter organization KIPP. During my time at KIPP, Salesforce was a daily part of the vocation in relation to data tracking, and upkeep of pertinent student information."
good,"Salesforce is a great company with a titan of a name on your resume. Great people and a good culture help overshadow the fact that account executives are vastly underpaid compared to 99.9% of other companies. The skills you learn as a sales person are invaluable, just be prepared to work 10-14 hour days in order to make any kind of money."
good,"Great experience, you really learn a lot. Some teams have better culture that others, just like everywhere. My co-workers were mostly great people always ready to help, communicate, collaborate. BUT when it comes to managements it is exactly the opposite - everything is done behind the closed doors, no transparency, decisions are made based on personal preferences, not on results or analysis. in a word - people who scheme and pretend to be always busy always advance and grow. Those who actually work and deliver results (hence don't have time or desire to scheme) - oh well."
good,"Perhaps one of the greatest enterprise companies with high customer focus. Growing very fast, which is good and bad. Responsibilities are not always clear, but would give a high score to overall management style."
good,"Should be able to:"
good,"Une des meilleures entreprises de Cloud computing au Monde qui sait attirer les talents mais ne sait pas les garder, faire evoluer ses employes"
good,Amazing industry with great growth potential. Hardest part of the job is management and changing dynamics of roles. Company culture is sometimes not what it seems.
good,A great place to work with fun loving people and the culture is unique. The most enjoyable part of the job are the field engagements where the whole team come together to complete critical tasks.
good,Good Compensation and work environment. Good Learning Opportunites. Good team. More Technology exposure. Good Management. Team outing and more fun.
good,Great projetcs with a lot of scope to learn and grow. Conducive atmosphere. Good job culture and job security. Very experienced management personnel to help guide in tough situations.
good,I learn new skills regarding accounting. This was a temp job.
good,"Good working atmosphere "
good,"When the customers recognize the platform can do most anything simply, but requires dedicated talent to understand and support the platform, all is well.  When a customer simply purchases the solution with no tangible plan to learn and support it.. you have your work cut out for you,"
good,"Salesforce is a great place to work—not perfect, but still one of the best companies out there. They do their best to promote their corporate values, and the effort is appreciated."
good,Salesforce is a good place to work for those who are looking to settle down for some time because it has great work life balance but if you want to work on cutting edge technologies then it is not the place.
good,"I wouldnt recommend strategy unless youre used to the night and weekend grind of responding to leadership. There are definitely other teams that have better work culture. But if strategy is your passion, you'll def learn from smart individuals"
good,"Salesforce is a great place to learn and grow if you are in the right vertical and the right team.  Otherwise, you are grinding with a massive quota over your head.  "
good,"Great place to work "
good,"It was a good company, but the work/life balance was terrible in the department that I worked in. Shift schedule which rotated every 6 weeks between days/nights."
good,Salesforce has a great platform and company workflows to allow the team to be very productive.  Great planning (V2MOM) and outstanding solutions from sales and service to marketing.
good,"Salesforce is a good place to work. Fun, smart and energetic co-workers. Long hours and they expect you to get results. Lots of sales enablement training."
good,"Overall, co-workers at Salesforce are great. There is a friendly and welcoming environment. Work tends to be very specialized."
good,I worked for a startup that sold health insurance online.  Eventually the company shut down.  I did Salesforce admin along with other database work.
good,The culture of this company is fun and exciting. There is always a lot to do and learn. You always have people around you that will help you grow.
good,"- Having a sales funnel cake"
good,"I just answered calls & emails for this company, it was fun & the pay was decent, the hours I worked were great & I had ample opportunity to gain overtime regularly. The hardest part of this job was learning the ins & outs of the constantly changing software. We had new releases for new features twice a year. The customers would call with the issue before I would usually get an email about the current bug. Still, even with the challenge it was fun, I enjoyed the competitiveness with my coworkers to see who could figure out the bugs/problems solutions the quickest & I felt like I was constantly learning. I enjoyed gaining knowledge in computers, software & culture around the world through my customers. The lounge with TVs, video games & an awesome cafeteria were nice perks as well!"
good,"Great new technology company that was purchased by a large public company that didn't ""get"" what made them successful.  Took a long time for them to understand the market and management took the company in the wrong direction for quite sometime."
good,"The facilities are amazing and help create a productive and relaxing environment. I have learned hard skills and philanthropic concepts throughout my years here that I apply in my daily life.  I love the workplace culture and the events offered to employees including volunteer time off. This creates a great mental health balance and awareness. "
good,"Salesforce cares about their employees. It's a fun place to work and learn. "
good,"In Hawaiian culture, “Ohana” means family; it's the tie that binds people together. Our Ohana is built on four core values that inspire us to work together every day toward improving the world."
good,"Salesforce is a rated as one of the best companies to work for because of the great work life balance, great benefits, and wonderful Volunteer program."
good,"Go past the Salesforce image of a great culture and collaborative environments with lots of feedback, and there's still the work, which comes fast and furious. Salesforce is not for those who cannot function in a whirlwind, always on the go environment, but those who work thrive under pressure will love the opportunities and challenges that come your way every day. Also, a company that truly walks the walk and talks the talk when it comes to diversity, equal rights, equal pay, and total inclusion."
good,A typical day included a pretty steady flow of work. Minimum down time but enough time to be productive task wise. The workplace culture placed an emphasis on work/ life balance. Overall it is a great place to work.
good,"Great company with really good intentions. However, they want/need to expand exponentially and that leads to a little confusion. "
good,"Great work culture, snacks and drinks provided, great office buildings."
good,Provide support and training to multiple applications and programs. These applications utilized by a medium to large user community serving multiple business functions.
good,We work from home and once in a while we also go to office or client side
good,"Each day is a fun and collaborative experience.  I often times work with different groups and leverage my reporting background to help improve broken processes.  My co-workers are very social, mobile and open to challenges and helping one another.  The hardest part of my job is balancing my work/life balance.  Salesforce.com is a fast paced company on the rise with new business and acquisitions.  The best part of my job is also the same as the hardest part of my job."
good,Maturing market. Shifting direction. Trying to change too fast for too big a company
good,Exciting global position managing the design and construction of worldwide office facilities.
good,"Salesforce is a very fast pace environment and will train you to be the best you can be to fit in the culture.  They pay well and the benefits are great!  The hardest part of the job is some of the management you would have to report to.  "
good,"I do love working at Salesforce. The company culture is great and the company has amazing products. "
good,"I really do enjoy my job. Best part is that every day is filled with learning opportunities and challenges. Hardest part of this job is the 24/7 on call schedule, this can be very challenging to achieve a work life balance.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people and all the new technology I get a chance to work with."
good,"Great Culture. Great Platform. Great Customer. Great Outcomes. It is a pressure cooker, but, if you have used a pressure cooker, sometimes it is the only way to cook ;-)"
good,The best part of working here is the availability to work a flexible schedule.  They try to create a work/life balance when possible.  I have improved upon my customer service skills.
good,"Payed a lot, but didn't learn terribly much and didn't get much performance feedback until right before I left."
good,"A Typical workday for me having a task or a project in place that needs sa development. I have done some functional task as well in Salesforce such as creating Object and fields, workflow, process builder etc."
good,"I am thankful to giving this opportunity for my career. work environment is so cool and they are guide to me, how to interactive with our client by meeting."
good,I loved the company and was excited to be apart of the salesforce culture.  When my manager retired I wasn't left with many options for an internal transition because the company is so HQ centric. It's sad to be leaving my team and my friends I've made over the last year.
good,The best place to work with competitive salaries and benefits.
good,"- Challenging, yet rewarding"
good,The day is spent in providing solution to worldwide customer regarding their problem in Salesforce. Either you troubleshoot the problem or you find a work around for it.
good,Great product and great name to work for. Work/life balance is good. They've made a lot of strides with diversity and inclusion but these things take time. Benefits are good but compensation isn't the best in tech. Great CEO and fun environment.
good,"Salesforce has great solutions and an outstanding message, but the environment is definitely geared towards younger people.  Also, Salesforce is known as a difficult company to do business with and spends a lot of time getting in its own way."
good,Nice company mission but not everyone follows it internally sadly.  A lot of the sales reps were pretty cut throat and frankly mean. It was pretty surprising. Overall it was eh.
good,"More work to do than people to do it, but enjoyable and satisfying none the less. Expect a lot of long days and late nights, but also expect to learn a lot and work with some fantastic people."
good,"Came in at work around 9am and left around 5pm. "
good,My first Dreamforce I got to see U2.  How can anyone not love that.  Incredible product offering and the leader in SaaS.  Very driven and specific sales method.
good,"Fast growing environment which encourages employees to develop an out-of-the boy attitude and accepts failure."
good,"Typical day would include reviewing incoming e-mail in-boxes and prioritising workload accordingly.  Raising installation requests whilst maintaining data spreadsheets to include volumes and costs via Excel.  Providing spare parts or samples to end users as and when requested, supporting the external sales team with all ad-hoc admin requests, data spreadsheets, technical information, and assisting with Contract amendments for pricing using SAP and Salesforce."
good,"- Quality of work done"
good,"Great company, exceptional culture and great people around. Lot of fun and work life balance is top notch. Compensation part can be better but overall really nice company to work"
good,"Great benefits/ salary, workplace culture and work environment. Supports career growth and cross company collaboration. Free snacks and many salesforce discounts."
good,"Overall, it was fun working with Dell.I learned a lot while working there.I got a lot of work n development."
good,"The culture was awesome. The territories were really chopped up that made it hard to really blow it out. They offer excellent process. "
good,"good place to work, good environment, team work, lunch time flexible,group activities, company policy, learning opportunities, opportunity for professional development."

good,"Amazing company and culture, I would not turn a single person away from this amazing company . . . . But stay away from the Spokane office.

good,"Salesforce is one of the best, if not the best companies I've ever worked for. The culture, the technology, the vision are all great.

good,"Salesforce is very supportive of working families, with generous parental leave and a culture that acknowledges the importance of work-life balance. That being said, plenty of folks log on and continue their work after the kids have gone to bed. Divisive issues and political discussions abound, and can be a distraction. Ideas about privilege theory and cultural appropriation are presented as truths, not idealogical perspectives. Opinions on guns, abortion, and border policy typically skew one way. Hard to believe that these types of discussions are being encouraged, but they are. It's considered part of bringing your authentic self to work. If you can keep your head down, work hard, and try to ignore the politics, it's worth it."

good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work in my roles there. You need to be flexible and skilled at prioritization and comfortable with change, both responsibility-wise and organizationally. It's an environment where you are constantly learning and you are regularly challenged regardless of how long you have been there.  It is a fun place to work with a great culture."

good,"The person who was supposed to train me was uncooperative and didn't want to share or train me properly. I had zero assistance from management and there was days I had nothing to do and was left to twiddle my thumbs while I tried assisting other departments as best I could.

good,"A great place to further your career. The work environment is relaxing, the workspace was really well thought. The people are always willing to help and give advice, especially towards interns."
good,"Working in Success Management provides a highly varied and challenging scope of activities, both business and technology, all centred around doing the right thing for the customer.  Be prepared to cope with rapid change, but if you like always having something new to tackle and are prepared to invest in yourself and network extensively then job satisfaction and recognition opportunities abound.  It's tough breaking into leadership roles because the amount of talent here is staggering, but for roles below Director level there are clear and well supported career paths; Director and above are expected to take the lead on their path.  Overall its hard to beat working with some of the best people worldwide and Leaders who believe and at least try to execute against what they say."

good,"Priorities change fast here. Your first 3 months will be trying to make sense of it and feeling frustrated, until it eventually clicks that ""the rules are made up and the points don't matter"" (like Whose Line). Salesforce is approaching 40,000 employees but in many ways has retained that ""start-uppy"" feel of pivoting on a dime to build and release products sourced right from customer needs. "
good,Iam very lucky to say about Salesforce.com Salesforce employee is creative thinking knowledge and happy life doing job as a Salesforce Admin and Developer
good,"It has a great company culture and great work environment. Definitely a place where you can move up the ladder and grow internally within the company as well. Every company likes to claim they have a greta work environment but here at Salesforce its the real deal, You can literally meet anyone at any given moment, walking down the hall and introducing yourself.  From the past experiences of my colleagues this would't happen anywhere else, you'd either get a awkward hello or get brushed off."
good,Salesforce is a great company to start your career. Very positive environment and a lot of growth. Great training are and management super supportive.

good,"The tech-startup culture is long gone at Salesforce. Still has great benefits and pay, but the top down 'follow these rules and don't ask questions' feeling is quickly creeping up."
good,"Salesforce, Inc. is an excellent place to work.  Like most, the quality of your day to day work life and delivery expectations are made or broken based on your direct manager.  I have the best manager I have ever had in my career.  In general the culture is high achieving, and makes do with less in the field than in HQ.  I successfully lead a large distributed team, and they are easily the best team I have ever worked with in my career. "
good,"Salesforce gave me a great opportunity to build my network and learn how to work in a professional environment at a quick paste, everything is changing"

Our focus on doing well by doing good is no joke. Volunteering and caring for the communities we touch are just part of our DNA.

Best part? TEAMS & team mentality fully supported & encouraged. I love the volunteer time off/wellness initiatives that support WL balance. I feel valued here and that I have a job no matter what area I focus on. Encouraged career-growth is the norm but not necessarily defined as ladder-climbing. Change is constant but opens opportunities & keeps skills sharp. Those who know how to use their resources (ample here!), who can advocate on behalf of the client/team effectively (up/down an org), can drive results and invest in the innovation of the company, and lastly, those who are courageous at communicating, do very well here. I see myself investing my time & skills to Salesforce and it's economy for a long time!"

Fitness monthly benefit, good health insurance, most teams have bonuses (but watch out, sometimes its incredibly hard to meet your bonus), gym in building, free company swag, reimbursements for things like BOSE headphones, etc. "
good,"When I started working there, I was completely unprepared for the ""friendly-ness"" of the work environment.  The coworkers were really nice, and the facilities were chock-full of comforts and amenities.  They really seem to be placing an emphasis on keeping the employees happy to be there.  Too bad it was a temporary position."
good,"Quick paced and results-expected but very collaborative, open, supportive environment to work.  Benefits and culture support work-life balance where you can get behind and believe in the company you work for."
good,"Work environment is great. Good training for new employees. Management helps when needed."
good,"A day in the life of a Salesforce intern was pretty simple. They expected us to come in on time and work on our projects for the summer and collaborate with our team. The culture was very good, a lot of fun and very supportive. The hardest part of the job was feeling like you were doing work that actually made an impact. But the best part was the work life in general, very balanced and you feel like they really value you."
good,The work place culture is amazing. Everyday work starts with a challenge. It was  the perfect place as an Intern to start my career Learned many things and would recommend salesforce as a definite place to work.

good,It is very good place to enjoy the work and our management are very friendly nature with employees
good,It was managed by a family that treated us like family. Business came first in everyone's mind but concern for others outside of 9-5 was definitely #2. It was a sad day when new law was passed that caused my position and entire section of company to be laid off.
good,I worked for Salesforce as a contract employee for a month. I worked on the Salesforce software as a Data Entry analyst working on there R12 software. We had 8 analysts work on the project where we were transfering data from the old software into the new R12 program that Salesforce had created. It was a great experience and was a terrific company to work for and hope to some day return back and grow with a wonderful company like Salesforce.
good,salesforce.com is a leading company in cloud applications
good,"I have never experienced a company's growth the way I am feeling it with Salesforce.  It's a company where there are constant acquisitions, and the teams are always growing.  You will learn a lot!  You will also know the SF values by heart and it will be easy to feel like the Salesforce employees are a family and love giving back."
good,"-Salesforce demonstrates Ohana tremendously!"
good,"I've worked at Salesforce for over 5 years now and all those things you hear are true. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop but it just never does. I enjoy my daily responsibilities (checking in with the team, collaborating with internal and external customers, bettering myself with available development trainings), my team, going to work in the morning, my leaders, my direct and indirect peers, the perks, the technology, the workspaces,  the investment in learning and growing and that I have flexibility. "

In addition to having an exciting and rewarding work environment, I feel good about working for Salesforce because of the company's values and dedication to treating its employees well (the benefits and culture are second to none) and to improving the state of the world through our business model, our technology, and through giving back."
good,"I have working here that you get out what you put in, Salesforce will provide you with all the support you need but you have to take ownership of your destination."
good,"- Review forecast "
good,"Like many of you, I get pinged all the time with recruiter calls, and frankly, most of the time I politely refuse to engage. Why? Because i work at an awesome company, with great benefits, a flexible work environment, and an amazing culture of collaboration and giving back. So far, no other company has been able to provide me with enough incentive to leave all of that good stuff. Is it perfect? No! But, this is a company that genuinely makes the effort to stay accountable, customer focused, and supportive of its employees. I have been in 4 jobs here in 5+ years, two on the same team and I love the opportunity to explore new things while staying in the same company. "
good,"Awesome company, great culture, exciting technology. High caliber people to work with, great management style, e.g. fair and transparent. Great future prospect as well."
good,I enjoyed working in a place with highly intelligent people.  Management allows you to thrive and showcase your ability to do the work.  I worked hard but at the same time had an amazing time.  I feel the energy is super positive no matter how difficult the task or project may feel at the moment.  I would welcome the opportunity to work here again.  I had an amazing manager and mentor to guide me in my position.
good,"Fun, fast paced working environment with all the fun perks and snacks. Once you learn all of the Salesforce products you will be good to go. Has many perks that other companies don't and the work life balance is great."
good,"Fantastic company to work for but probably stay away from sales if you're iffy about it. Management only cares about numbers (it's just sales though, not salesforce in particular)."
good,"Salesforce is led by a CEO whose mantra is ""the business of business is to make the world a better place""."
good,"I loved working here! It is by far the best company I have worked for. I would say if you have the chance to even take a temp opportunity here, I would take it!"

good,A typical day at work for me at Salesforce.com was very fun yet busy all the time. While I was at Salesforce.com I gained a lot of knowledge from fellow colleagues.

The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see colleagues everyday.

good,I love to work at SFDC and it is an enjoyable workplace and having lots of fun.

Salesforce seemed to maintain some of the same culture of the startup along with solid benefits. Salesforce encouraged self starters to excel and those who needed help got help.
good,"Salesforce.com has an amazing work environment. There is always someone there to assist in the event help is needed. Management is obscure in that there are 2-3 supervisorial roles for any single position. Everyone has a great attitude about the company and is always trying to further each other's careers, not just their own."
good,Salesforce is a fast paced company with an extremely positive work environment.
good,"Salesforce.com offers a very competitive internship program, and one that I would return to. It pays competitively, they house tech interns, and the culture is not only fun and social but also very welcoming. As an intern, I never felt inferior."
good,"Salesforce is known for being an innovation leader.  To thrive, you need to stay abreast of our products and the trends of the industry you support.  The sales teams have a large extended support organization to help you drive customer success.  Management encourages you to be accountable and to ask for help when you need it."

Everybody's goals are public, there is a lot of respect for peers with diversity and inclusion being on the company's core values.

good,Great place to work and succeed. Managers are supportive and team players. They also layout a clear path and a clear direction for success and career growth.

good,"Culturally strong"
good,"Salesforce is a great place to work. The company values learning, encourages employees to give back to their communities through grants and volunteer time off, and puts its customer first which leads to success across the board.

good,Te enseñan las habilidades necesarias para implementar el software
good,Een erg leuke en lonende werkplek. Ik zou het aan een vriend aanbevelen.

good,"Culture wise this is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5."
good,"At Salesforce we have a strong culture of feedback and transparency. We learn how to give constructive feedback, but more importantly we learn how to value feedback, how to be open-minded towards it, and how to leverage it. We use our internal “Feedback App” in order to give instantaneous feedback with the purpose of initiating a conversation around it."
good,"We do business right, and problems get surfaced quickly. The policy that helps ensure this remains true in R&D is that we are able to switch to other teams easily and without obligation to our prior teams. This allows people to find the right fit and better growth opportunities instead of needing to switch companies, but also surfaces problem with leadership on teams if a particular team has too much turnover. I think all companies should promote internal team switches, and that this policy is one of the best ways we ensure a healthy work culture at Salesforce."
good,"Salesforce is an amazing company to work for. The culture is fantastic complimented by amazing offices (desks, kitchens, chill out zones etc.) at Salesforce Tower London.  Collaboration across management layers and departments is extremely transparent which means your productivity is high. There is a common goal to breakdown barriers and overcome any hurdles.  The product is cutting edge in terms of what it offers as a Customer Experience Platform from Sales through to Service, Marketing, Commerce etc. so your work/meetings/conversations with customers, friends and colleagues are always relevant and interesting.  With the Product often being business critical to our customers, meeting their expectations is always a challenge so prepare to push yourself and explore. Giving back is a huge part of the Salesforce mantra and I've managed to setup a Community Football Academy for boys and girls in my local area who have not had the opportunity to participate. This is a proud achievement and hopefully a legacy I'll leave behind."

good,"I enjoyed the job and the environment. I learned a lot of things and was able to teach what I had learned. I did the configuration of sales force software, based on the customers needs.

good,"A typical work day is process invoices, coding, matching the invoice to the PO and if not then we need to ask for an approval from the department manager before we can process the invoice for payment.

The most enjoyable part of the job is coworker, friends you meet, it is a good environment."
