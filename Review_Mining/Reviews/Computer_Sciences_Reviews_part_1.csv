bad,"Management (Upper) was terrible. Employees were unhappy and treated like children. Horrible work environment. Numbers and productivity stressed while creativity and trying to fix or improve the system in place were frowned upon. A lot of promises were made to employees that never happened and seem to be a ploy to keep employees from leaving. Most employees were unhappy and only stayed for promises made, commute and until they could find something better."
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for. They hired me as a consultant but did not assign me to a project.  Promised I would have a mentor since I never consulted before but left me stranded and on my"
bad,Don't take the forest Mississippi Job.   They will only keep you for 3 years.   You will not have enough help onsite.   You will not have enough help remotely.  No will know the scope of your job duties. It is very disorganized.  If you decided you want it ask for at least 25.00 hourly.  You will work for every penny.     Men are paid more than women.
bad,Very stressful working environment. Management has no say in top down direction. lots of outside consulting companies brought in to make direction and personnel changes changes
bad,"There was no job advancement, the managers are clueless and never read anybody’s emails or get involved in issues or solutions. "
bad,I have worked for DXC for 14 years and I haven't received a raise for the last 5 years. Hence the reason to look for another job. I don't want to write anything in here
bad,I worked for the internal help desk assisting my fellow teammates and I saw firsthand how this company treated their employees. The culture of this company promotes an abusive employer and employee relationship.
bad,They only care about the managers and they're not concerned with the qualifications of the managers. The work environment is poor and stressful. They government customer comes before the employee.
bad,Management was horrible on the contract that I worked on.  The manager did not care about his team and showed lack of respect.  I would not recommend CSC to anyone.
bad,CSC had poor management on the contract that I worked on.  They did not care about the there employees.  CSC had a high turnover rate before I left the company.
bad,"I give this company no stars because they give no raises at all but more work, they over look people that is more qualified for jobs. not good place to work at."
bad,Most people working at CSC were not qualified to do the jobs hired for. This ment the few that were qualified would have to do the work of those that were not qualified.
bad,"Due to departmental job vacancies I was asked to edit and write programs which was outside of area of expertise and not in my job description."
bad,"I have nothing to add to this.  The job was stressful, poor management, lost one major contract due to poor management.  Reduction in force.  Horrendous commute."
bad,This company is not a place for anyone to apply to they do not give raises they cut out over time but they increase some of the work. there is no growth in this company at all. Low Manger skills. They cut back on supplies that you need to work with.
bad,"the job consist of processing paid wic vouchers for all counties around the USA"
bad,"Very stressful environment, poor management & favoritism. Only room for advancement if your selected to be giving the opportunities. Its defin not based upon what you know but if the manager would like to give you an opportunity"
bad,"CSC - Pleasantville, NJ. Nothing special here. Typical federal government contractor. Low tech work. Pure software maintenance. No useful documentation."
bad,"They do not appreciate their employee's. You are just a number to them. Hate how this company acts like they care and as soon as you have a problem at work, then you are out the door."
bad,"I did not work directly for CSC. However, CSC was purchased by SRA, the new company is now called CSRA. As a contractor my time at CSRA is quite good, and the work is challenging."
bad,Computer Science Corporation won the contract where I had already been working. They came in a computer company thinking that they could work on aircraft. They were sadly mistaken. They changed everything we were doing which cause them to have a mass layoff and shortly after 2 years there were kicked out of contract
bad,"Poor management of consultants and work culture is not good and lot  of politics by middle management, No job security and pay is very less, their is no process approach for management."
bad,"Mangers are inept at speaking with or to there employees about process or procedures. No one is held accountable for there actions, this includes employees leaving early or not showing up at all."
bad,"At the risk of being terminated, I think it's time that I speak the truth about things at this point in my career and in my life in general. Working for this company, by far, has been the biggest waste of my career for the past 5-6 years!! It is my own fault that I have remained here as long as I have hoping that things would get better and change for the employees. Nothing that was promised during the initial interview for employment with this company has ever come to pass, it was all hype and lies. The management/ corporate structure of this company is not interested. in the least. to help it's employees advance in their careers whatsoever. They are strictly hands off and literally have said, ""don't expect help from us in advancing your careers, it is entirely up to you"". Yet, they insist on the top professional skills and commitments to their clients without the benefit of training analysts to provide that service. It is only through the sheer will and self-professionalism of the Analysts that there continues to be professional analysis and customer service to the client base. Plus, we haven't had an increase in salary, not even a COLA raise in over five years, while certain management types continue to collect high bonuses and pay raises."
bad,"Management is very rude, there is no job security. The hardest part of the job is the management and what is expected of you. No one is ever in agreement with anything."
bad,"Don't work here if you are a woman. They will treat you very poorly. ALL of the people I worked with were male. Comments were made around me about how I shouldn't do things because I may break a nail, or if one of them were to wear a dress they may get items they need faster. "
bad,Not a good time to work at CSC.  The company is in transition and does not care about the happiness of its employees.  The company has a huge turnover at the time and is not a good place to work if you want a good work life balance.
bad,They care nothing for employees and do not value skills only the bottom line.  Awful benefits even the 401k is rigged.  Management is awful and the corporate environment is bad
bad,"No raises, no bonuses, management has no clue about anything, they constantly lay-off people as per their  ""reduction in force"" policy, they even shut down from Christmas to New Years and expect you to use your vacation days and if they are already used you do not get paid for that week!!!! STAY AWAY"
bad,"I've worked there twice before and the first time starting back in 2009 was agreeable. I was moved up to another position that I was not trained properly for and I found employment elsewhere. So many companies have left the building that they have shut down the cafeteria, closed parts of the building, there are leaks coming in everywhere from the glass roof and all security personnel were laid off except one. The campus is huge, almost like a small college, and used to be maintained. It was beautiful with swans, geese and ducks in the ponds, even fish, now only the ducks remain and the maintenance staff doesn't even clean the poo off of the walkways. It's a sad place to be and to work."
bad,"I have opinions of CSC as any employee of any corporation has, I choose to not publicize mine. I don't feel anything I can say will influence anything so I reserve my right to not comment."
bad,"There is no team work at this place   "
bad,"Beware of this company.  There's a reason why they are positioned on the TOP WORST COMPANIES TO WORK FOR list for 2015.  Terrible micromanagers, horrid working conditions, no training, poor benefits, no stability, rude employees, the list goes on.  They tend to hire older more destitute workers because they are more likely to succumb to their tactics. They prefer unprofessional to professional because the professional people LEAVE.  THINK TWICE ABOUT ANY OFFER MADE HERE.  NOT WORTH IT."
bad,"Turnover Rate High, no communication among teams, multiple managers within the company, job description change each time there was a new manager."
bad,"Very cool and approachable management, with a lot of scope to learn and domain in the IT field. Large number of projects in hand and flexible hours"
bad,CSC over the last 3 years has made many changes that do not fit the culture of the people.  The company has lost the CARE about the people. The leadership has one thing on it mind and that is to preparing the company to be sold so the people who are left are not the in the best interest of the company.
bad,"I don't know how else to say it.  Terrible management, worse program management, no opportunity for growth, an old company suffering from nepotistic poison that will lead to it's demise if they cannot straighten things out."
bad,"I believe this place no longer exits, due to bad sales, some co-worker were good to work with."
bad,CSC was a bad company.  I did not have a good experience at all when CSC took over my contract.
bad,maintained IT security computer software gained knowledge of scheduling and Field Support.
bad,CSC was no different than working for L-3.
bad,When you start working there they promise raises then they turn around and tell every one of there employees that raises are not offered ever i worked there 3 years i was always promised but when it came to get your raise they made a excuse about 98 employess walked out after 2 years because of this
bad,"managers are always changing, my supervisor had no idea how to manage a large group.  There are no job advancements, and they do no give raises. Their way of avoiding raises is to allow casual dress code. and only dress professional when clients are known to be in. Cindy Scott oversees the accounts from North Carolina and she is heartless. they demand you be there at 8 am. they had me pay 140 day care bill or lose my job because they didn't want 3 people out in one day.  You felt the negative presence immediately when you are audited as well.  your audits show all bad no praise or encouragement of any sort."
bad,"they are still under construction, they have there busy days and there slow days. they just cut out the over time for now because of the budgert. so we have to watch out time"
bad,"Promises, promises, promises with no delivery. The culture at CSC and now DXC has always been Wall Street first, make sure the accounts do not sue and employees last. Personally, I would avoid taking a role here again."
bad,"- Terrible management - Untrained and inexperienced"
bad,"worked 2 roles over 4-5 years. Had a friend in management and survived but afterwards, environment was terrible, many people ;left and worked elsewhere. Their pay was not competitive. turnover was high. shift management was very immature"
bad,"This job was just to gain experience to advance somewhere else. The hours were the worst, the scheduling is unprofessional,  and then the checks show up late and short changed."
bad,"typical day involved 12 hours of conference calls and web meetings"
bad,"My experience with CSC was great while I was in entry level positions and pay; however, as I gained experience and my degree and attempted to collaborate with the Program Office to advance, they became very hostile and unsupportive."
bad,The company has only gone down hill further after the merger with HPE.  Layoffs are happening on a basis of every 2 months.  The company will do what ever to cut costs and the cost of the employee and client.
bad,"A typical day starts with stand up meeting for the work to be accomplished. It was a half an hour meeting then work begins."
bad,techs over worked no moral because CSC did not believe in giving any type of cost of living or rises  manger was in another state and in some cases tech never got meet there manage
bad,Work days are typical.  I learned not to answer intrusive questions.  I also learned never say anything about management ever for any reason.  I took cultures and concepts in college and although I know how to answer this question I am NOT going to answer it.  The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job are subjective.  I suppose that people in an insane asylum enjoy bouncing their head off the wall but I would not.
bad,"No job advancement. This is only a good job for a temporary time. Pay is really low for the type of work. Management is almost non existent, they show up occasionally and don't offer much help."
bad,"CSC was a stressful, political culture where the management team did not work well together. The CEO set the tone -- and a very bad one at that! I would not recommend the company to my worst enemy."
bad,Management has no care for its staff. Staff are over worked and asked to accomplish things without proper training . There is no room for advancement within the company.
bad,"This company is a contractor for the government. Providing backup positions in fields of IT, customer support, clerical, data entry, and various other jobs. "
bad,"This company was the contact for the providers for new medicaid program which had not had any change for over 30 years.The program had so many problems, some physicians had to close their doors b/c medicaid was the entire resource for running their business.  No one knew how to get through the problems with the physicians reapplying for medicaid. It literally was a nightmare!"
bad,This was my first company to work and learnt a lot here. The team consisted of freshers and we all had fun time. The work environment was awesome and I miss this place a lot. The team leads were very friendly and worked with us during hectic work.
bad,"Juggled several priorities Daily while maintaing excellent rapport with management, client and employees."
bad,"Stagnant work style with no progress in the role."
bad,"I was on this contract for 9 years. First with ManTech subcontracted under CSC since 2004 and in 2011 CSC pushed a corporate take over and everthing went down hill. CSC uses peoples resumes to falsely represent knowledge and severely under bid to win contracts and then pay you enough to get by.(a quater of what they charge the government.) I was let go on what the company called a RIF. (Reduction In Force) I have seniority with nothing negative against me and I'm the first to go; how does that benefit a corporation? It goes to show, just cause you have a Masters Degree in basket weaving(not even under water) doesn't make you qualified to be a manager. The company does not like to pay back money owed to the employees from prior pay raises either. It's always another excuse. Lesson well learned ""Never Again"" Shame on me."
bad,"A typical day at work was generally interesting which varied from travelling to various offices in my position as a Quality Assurance Engineer."
bad,It is a typical big brother company where you would be worked and not have the opportunity to take vacation when you wanted to take it. the job required 7 work days and after hours support. Hiring freezes and pay raises were frozen where the rules seemed to change every 6 months to a year where layoffs were happening frequently
bad,"Not sure what to explain about this one. Call Center enviroment. No lunches. Provided lunch to work through lunch. Bad location, terrible parking, low morale."
bad,"couldn't find much of opportunities,"
bad,"Good to join if you are married recently and looking for more of free time than work"
bad,I am at a loss for words. I have been with CSC for many years and it just keeps getting worse. I can't remember the last time I had a salary increase. I am ready to move on.
bad,"If you are a part of the actual business then you may be safe but if you are not then your position is always in danger, always at risk of just 'going away' and you cannot depend on actual ethical treatment from the upper management staff."
bad,"CSC used to be a great place to work.  But over the years, pay, advancement, employee moral and constant rif's have caused it to be a very poor working environment.  Many employees have gone nearly a decade with no pay increase and staff has been slashed to maintain profit margins without any decrease in workload.  It's very hard to be positive about this company anymore."
bad,"This is not a good place to work, if you like to be compensated for your work on a yearly basis. This is the first company I have ever worked for, that does not compensate their employees for a well done job after getting a great reviews year after year. They send emails to advise how well be company is doing, but the employees don't see any compensation. Not to mention how overworked a lot of their employees are"
bad,"Good comp"
bad,"Dead end would be putting it lightly. For the most part it's like a fire in a theater on a daily basis at my particular account. The technical staff are HIGHLY professional, talented and dedicated people who continue to strive for excellent client service despite the total nonexistence of recognition, raises, or any type of advancement. This is a good place to glean some great skills from others, but don't think for as second you are valued or will ever advance here."
bad,"I was employed by CSE, but worked for the Government. The Gov't was wonderful to me. I worked for a 1 Star General. First thing in the morning I went over his calendar with him. I answered and screened all phone calls. I made all of his travel arrangements. Settle his vouchers when he came back. Proof read all material for signature before going into the General. Scheduled all meeting with the staff and the General. Did payroll for 124 employees."
bad,"The job itself is not as hard as it, its more complicated to deal with management more then anything. They'll have there picks and anyone that is not advancing in anything. They have no appreciation for any of there employees Iv been employed there since 2008 almost 4 years and no appreciation has not been given."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work for such an unethical company"
bad,"stressful company to work for.     "
bad,For the last 6 years there has been no raises. There have been layoffs going on practically every month since the merge. The remaining staff is over worked and stressed out with all the work that is placed on them once layoffs are done.
bad,"CSC has laid off thousands of knowledgeable, hard working people to replace them with cheaper, poorly trained resources.  Reducing costs to increase revenue.  Poor planning!"
bad,"Its good company to prove the skills and for career growth."
bad,"We were outsourced to CSC - Most Raythoen employees consider CSC the Anti-Christ. After the outsourcing- the Raytheon people we worked with for years began to treat us like we were the Anti-Christ just because of the CSC moniker. Our layered supervisors were iin Tucson and El Segundo and had no clue of the work we did, except to tell us we were no longer allowed to do the work we did- which was logistics support and asset management for Raytheon Corporate network equipment worldwide. CSC was the worst company I have ever worked for in my entire life."
bad,great place for new csr's but management can improved when it comes to training.
bad,In my 3 years I had 4 PM's and about 6 managers in fact repeat managers.  No resources to increase value and if you asked around about changing position within csc you were reprimanded
bad,Would not recommend working at Computer sconce Corporation. Poor upper management. They look at anyway to screw the employee. Team mates are a great group of people.
bad,A typical day at work. What you learned. Management. Workplace culture. The hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job. Give us your opinion.
bad,No sense of care for their Employees they don't offer incentives and or pay raises for extra work you do. the place is not a fun environment its a real dreadful place.
bad,Very relaxed work environment with unlimited overtime for the same pay. No culture. No room for growth with pay. Hidden secrets within the company and greed.
bad,"CSC is primarily a government contractor, the corporate offices are in Virginia, just so they can get US government contracts."
bad,"While CSC has seen it's struggle with the board dismissing our CEO and CFO for improper accounting methods, we have a great new leader who is making changes to try to align the company.  This is a long time coming in my long 7 years with CSC.  Each year the inept management would ask me to write my own reviews and appraisals while offering meager raises and no opportunity for advancement or training.  They always asked us to sell and find new business but when I did find new opportunities for them they had no process or team or anyone who could engage the client and collect the revenue.  We left millions on the table with clients that needed leadership."
bad,"Used to be a good company but focus is missing. They don't care of employee anymore. They have good products and you can learn a lot, definitely have onsite opportunity."
bad,"This company was once, if not stellar, at least an acceptable company to work for.  There were enough opportunities and good people to work with to make it interesting.  Now this is no longer the case.  Employees need to feel valued, and in the current environment they don't."
bad,People I worked with made the job decent. But a lack of investment in the people by the company made the job difficult to look at as anything but a paycheck while it lasts.
bad,"typical day at work - too much work for one person .... not enough man-power to cover the necessary day-to-day duties."
bad,"A lot of red tape and top-heavy decisions that help stock in the short term but in reality involve selling soft assets that are essential to long-term success.  My job was making windfall profits for the company but additional growth and sustainability was hamstrung by internal barriers and lack of support, and ultimately the lack of additional opportunity or adequate pay resulted in easily finding a better situation elsewhere."
bad,Job security was at stack. there was no clarity about the projects. people were sacked very easily. there is very minimal proactive initiatives taken by HR for internal project movements/opportunities/skill up gradation.
bad,Company merger combined with continuous reductions in staffing caused for a stressful environment and the loss of a lot of good people.  Pay stagnant for the past 8 years with no increase to include cost of living.  Overall company is barely hanging on.
bad,"Upper management bluntly announced that there would be no salary increases and if employees wanted increases, they had to go somewhere else to get it. My feeling is that they are trying to eliminate all the local support for their client (UTC) and are forcing folks to leave since they put up data centers  in Philadelphia and Dallas."
bad,"From the top of the company, this is a poorly run company with lack of people skills. While they cut benefits and let go good workers, they have not provided any raises in 5 years. The VPs are getting bonuses and raises while the employees get nothing in return."
bad,"Less Work and no pressure, Good Environment , Old Infrastructure and tools used. No Growth in Learning, Very less hikes, Poor decision making in top Management."
bad,"Rumor is that most of CSC is a great working environment, but the Coppell TX facility certainly is not. Managers stab each other in the back on a regular basis, the management culture is so poor that CSC actually met 10 of the listed 12 items on a Forbes list of ""Things to look for in a toxic work environment"". You will not like this facility nor the corporate culture within it. I tell you this as an agent who was promoted to management, so I saw it from both angles."
bad,There is not much room for advancement here. They hold people back from their potential. I have been at the same position for 2 months now and havent had any opportunities to promote
bad,Very busy work environment. Great place if you love call center environment.
bad,I enjoy my work environment but I do not feel like a valued employee as the company does nothing to give you incentives or provide positive feedback for a job well done.
bad,"As a technical lead, you spend most of your day as the one who fields all the problems from the customer base and delegating down. However, there was always so much work to do, you were consistently in a game of LIFO."
bad,"Poor work culture. Negative outlook."
bad,"Been working here for nearly 3 years through an agency , looking for a permanent role."
bad,I was working 2 helpdesk and they wanted to put me on a third helpdesk without asking me. Managers were just kids with no consideration for IT Veterans.
bad,"A typical day was slow and stressful. I learned the concepts of Accounts and vendor management. Management was not knowledgeable of the work duties. The workplace culture was stressful. There really wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable things about the job were the hours, paid time off, and having all holidays off with pay."
bad,"CSC was all about billing. Didnt seem to care about employees at all."
bad,The applications taht most fo us work on outdated. No new business has happened to this organisation since an year. No proper performance reviewing system. Don't even expect the salary hike.
bad,"Did not realize employment with job was determined weekly.  When hired, was told the position would last for approx 3 years.  As job continued, realized was told on Friday if I should report for work on Monday."
bad,"Good Company for married people."
bad,"Beware, they will drop you like a hot potato if you client contract ends. No support what so ever. As long as your making them money they talk one tune and make the company sound good. But then if you complain for the client abusing you or ask you manager for help with something. It's like your annoying them asking for help."
bad,"Severe lack of incentives, acknowledgement and no raises for employees. Low morale and strong feeling of employees not being valued. Will allow you to work remotely."
bad,Can't seem to get it straight. Only thing keeping me here is the salary and flexible work schedule. Keep in mind they'll cut you once you start reaching the top of your career...keep moving.  Perf review system totally unacceptable; exceed performance last year but 'sorry we have no $'; this year reviewed in the 'improved system' - only 'met' my performance criteria for the 1st time in my entire 20+ career and reviewed by individuals who did not know me and who haven't even discussed it with me or my boss.   It was like a smack in the face. Not looking for a raise; job security would be nice. But not be acknowledged for a job well done.....says it all about what management thinks of their employees.  Corporation selling in OCT - I'm sure we'll all be excluded by then. Resignations daily.  Hoping mine is one day soon vs the 'pink slip'.  Pretty sad!  I would not refer a desperate friend here.  We all are sitting on fine sticks waiting to see which one breaks next.
bad,"The company went threw 3 mergers."
bad,I worked hard learned a lot great co-workers. All managers were great who I work with . CSC was a good company to work for then they started the laid off and cut back on healthcare.
bad,Smart people badly  managed. CSC has limited opportunity no matter how hard you work. CSC demands questionable hours of work that test labor laws. CSC offers very little incentives.
bad,The pays good but there is no kind of advancement. The warehouse cleanliness could use some work.  
bad,"Solid employment if you keep your head down and do your job, no room for advancement unless you are a relative or know management from previous employment / school. Was bragged to that the majority of the facility management went to highschool together, and when hired they hired in friends with no required experience or education. People with g.e.d.'s underperforming jobs that require masters degrees."
bad,"I never worked for a company that did not give yearly raised. You do have benefit health, vision, dental, and 401k. A typical day is 8 hours, I teach myself, management don't care, workplace ok, the hardest part no raise, the most enjoyable part  of the job leaving to go home."
bad,If you want to be treated like a robot and slave away for people to make big bonuses while they pay you scraps this is the place to work ! I highly dont recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"A typical day was coming in and taking calls from beginning to the end of your shift. Some days it was less volume and a bit of a ""slow day"" but most days it was back to back calls for the first 4-6 hours of the shift."
bad,"It's better to be employed than unemployed and to have benefits;"
bad,"I worked for Textron for 23 years,  we got outsourced to CSC, there goal was to get us all replaced with someone cheeper, once I hit 31 years, I was part of there RIF."
bad,My department managers are great but upper management are detached and arrogant. This company is very unstable. There are no incentives and the benefits are poor.
bad,"My supervisor was great. However, company management were looking to just make there margins and did not have much concern for product quality. Employee were not supported by upper management."
bad,Management consistently underestimates scope and length of projects holding staff to unrealistic deadlines.  Most of the employees with deep knowledge have quit or have been laid off in the company's short-sited efforts to improve revenues. Reliance on inexperienced contractors exacerbates the problems.
bad,The company has no organization and structure.  Management is allowed to treat employees however they want. Benefits are really good but pay sucks. Also there has been a freeze on raises for over 4 years.  Management seems to be the only ones getting annual raises.
bad,This company pays well but never gives raises regardless of performance or years of service.  The management structure and turnover is horrible.  They let people go on average every 3 months.  Advancement is impossible as management does not stay employed long enough.  In the 3+ years I worked for this company I had 4 managers and watched teams of people either leave or get laid off.  Hardest part of the job is trying to find out your roles and responsibilities based upon your access.
bad,"This is a Federal government outsource contract job."
bad,"Good life work balance, behind on technology and not good place to keep skills up to date, good environment and good people to work with. very limited advancement opportunities"
bad,"I was never happy at this company and management seemed pleased about that. There was a lot of wasted labor and effort. There was a lot of petty and vindictive behavior from some in leadership roles. They paid pretty well for the area, with lots of bonuses and incentives. The work was very easy and they had great benefits. But the atmosphere was always brutally oppressive and disheartening."
bad,"Good people good place to work no complaints , friendly and fun place to work. Cared about employees and made sure that you were as one team and provide all skills needed."
bad,"After working with clients and Project Managers spanning all of North America and other departments around the world on a daily basis, the company decided to take a new direction.  The Project Accounting department was moved completely offshore.  The benefits were nicer than the pay itself.  Teammates made an excellent work environment, if not always fully supported by fragmental management.  The flattening of management over the past 5-10 years was sorely apparent and, as noted above, most was moved offshore along with the Project Accounting positions."
bad,not a great place to work. Management had their favorites and where not afraid to show who they where.....great location for work/home. they worked with your home life sch. if things come up
bad,"Great place to explore new things and also gives us a chance to implement it."
bad,Upper management has no clue what is going on with employees.  We had managers not even located with the employees.
bad,"At first there was a lot of new things to learn and adapt to but as time went on management was getting complacent and the effects were visible. There was no compensation for hard work, many people were jumping ship but CSC would not hire replacements. Instead they just increased workload without any additional help."
bad,"learning is good"
bad,"manager is king , and lot of politics. Some Department Employees are Badly Treated . Some dep ask for Bond agreement"
bad,Nothing good to said about CSC.  Poor management with over work and under paid.  Employee moral was poor.  Everage 60-70 hours weeks is expected.  Though out 8 years with company I had 1.5% raise.
bad,"No perks, no benefits, lot of work, management favors their closed ones irrespective of performance. No salary hikes at all. Senior management is deaf and blind and pays no attention whatsoever at what is happening at junior level."
bad,"On the day of joining, no one knew at location about it except HR who was remote. No proper formalities. Work location was unclear and also I was forced to sit outside Unit as there was no dedicated area. I was also not allowed to leave campus during working hrs. Took a month to get project allocated even though I was lateral."
bad,Great opportunities but no work like balance.  Most work has been moved to India and Puerto Rico and the people left in the states have too much work and have to be accountable for things out of their control
bad,"it is good for experienced candidate not for fresher . i don't like working in csc as fresher, we didn't get hikes in this company well and i don't commander to others"
bad,"-A lot of responsibility"
bad,"Temp Agencies get you in the door with the promise of lengthy contracts and healthcare. Once I arrived it was clear that the call center was already sufficiently staffed. They dumped temp agents without a second glance. I would have loved to stay with the company. I was trained in every block of business there within 2 months of starting. Again, they were overstaffed and at exactly 90 days my contract was unfortunately released"
bad,"- excellent coworkers"
bad,Advancement is very slow and compensation is probably a little below the standard.  People that work for the company are very dedicated individuals.
bad,The company is in the midst of laying off as many people as possible and out source the work to India. Complete disconnect between top tier management and the managers and people doing the work.
bad,Management was rude and dishonest.  High turnover rate due to management.  Offered no training and there was no advancement opportunities.
bad,"Management did not possess leadership, planning, adequate staffing or project management skills necessary for successful implementation of a project of this scale. There was a general lack of planning for the project and many critical details were not worked out. Minimal concern was shown for employees as they were required to work 40+ hours every week and weekends at a moment's notice with little flexibility for employees. Conflicting direction was often given and necessary processes for success were not in place or clearly defined."
bad,"Above average pay for new hires for region. lower to intermediate management not trained well. promotions contingent upon friendship with management outside work. extreme level of workplace drama/stress. physical altercations, affairs, legal action all witnessed during my tenure."
bad,"Company was below average. The only things favorable was the few,but exceptional employees in some of the various functional stake holder groups. Management had real little respect or appreciation for their employees. Only what they could exctract from them in terms of work/overwork with minimal or token appreciation"
bad,The time I worked for this company seven years lacked direction.  Management was available but often felt distant.  Turnover was high and morale was low.  By the time I moved to another employer I felt my career had been sabatoged.
bad,"many changes through the years at CSC, now DXC.  Management focused on cost cutting and bottom line, but then cutting the abilities they need in order to grow topline revenue which is the biggest challenge of the company."
bad,"CSC is a matrix-based organization.  You're not always on the same team, and the timezone factors aren't always considered.  I've seen on several occasions where the job description was ""stretched"" to get people in the door."
bad,"Fun people work at CSC. I enjoy working at CSC.  Your job is what you make of it most times.  Always give your best and a hundred percent to get your job done, and the reward should follow."
bad,"Pros"

bad,Computer Sciences Corporation India Pvt.Ltd (CSC) Bangalore
bad,Timing is not a major issue here.Projects are not too good either.Mostly maintanance projects.
bad,"Work was not difficult but at times unclear , management was not clear /organized at times. Software was so old COBOL and not user friendly. Culture was not bad."
bad,"Worked at CSC for 19 years.  Was  great place, then went downhill.  My job was off-shored, as were many.  No longer a great place to work.  Nothing but instability and the constant worry of being let go."
bad,"The workplace culture is good. people will help to learn,but the management always hits the works. lot of process to work.Medical insurance is only one thing is good here."
bad,The work environment was stressful.  It became very difficult to separate work from personal.  Work compensation was at a stand still as there were no raises for 3 consecutive years even though the workload more than doubled.
bad,It was a good experience to be with CSC  for 3.5 years where I got chance to learn IMS DB at work.I worked in Production support for first time in this company.
bad,"I worked for CSC for almost 10 years, and while there I performed well and participated in every opportunity for professional improvement, including attending graduate school. The good thing about them is their educational assistance policy which is highly competitive, but that is about the extent of it."
bad,"Unable to move to another team..  Hard to move around as a contractor.  I do approve with my immediate management.  Our team build our jcls, create db2 testbase and/or slice."
bad,Not a good work environment and do not take care of employees
bad,It was a difficult place to work and feel good about it.  The client was for the most part really Good about everything.  Some of the manages where good but there where a few that broke all the rules of human decency
bad,it was a good company to work for. they let you work and did not micro manage you.  You always worked 40 hours per week.  the only bad kept the same pay
bad,Enjoyed working here for a very long time. Nobody to bother as long as your day to day deliverables are in place. Freshers can learn a lot of technologies.
bad,"Great customer base.  The company unfortunately does not value it's long term, loyal customers.  No funds are available for development unless customer funded.  Employee morale is at an all time low as the company has consistently removed benefits little by little."
bad,Management concept and Higher level management perception.
bad,"Nothing great. As it is a service based company, it is always a challenge may be because of the project i got. Project managers are very rude where i worked."
bad,"They are an outsourcing company. CSC worked employees until projects ended and would not keep you employed. They should have kept up ongoing education, but they did not."
bad,"This was a good company to work for.  My only complaint is that I was hired through a temp agency and informed that there would be a 90 day trial period and after the 90 days I would be hired or not.  After my 90 days were up I ask the supervisor that the place of employment along with the temp agency if there were any plans on hiring me permanently.   Both the supervisor and the temp agency me that the paperwork had been started for me to be hired.  I ask them several times the weeks after that but they kept telling me the same information and that the contracts take a while to be processed.  Months passed with nothing but they are still working on it.  Finally 2 years later, I received a call from the temp agency at 11:00pm stating that ""my contract was up and they never had any intentions of hiring you."
bad,"Same as working for DynCorp previously, but many changes. leave it at that. Co-workers was great people to be around, e all helped each other out."
bad,"No work life balance. Long hours to work.Job culture is not that much good"
bad,A good company to work for. There are a lot of opportunities while working at CSC.
bad,Good Co-Worker
bad,"Work/Life balance is really good in this company. But learning is very less. When comes to career growth is is a bit poor. Seniors have kept a lot of dependencies as they are working in this organization from a long time and secure their jobs by keeping information to them. In all, CSC is not a company to start up with but it is the best company to end up with."
bad,"Lead in selecting, developing and implementing digital asset management (DAM) systems throughout Disney-ABC Television. DAM system platforms strategic to division goals of electronic media standardization (tape-less processing)."
bad,"A typical day at work involves close attention to detail.  I've learned the tenets of Six Sigma and ITIL. Co-workers are very skilled, knowledgeable and supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting deadlines."
bad,Very good and happy with my present job.it`s been easy and happy to manage life balance without pressure.And coming to colleagues are very kind to help with smile.
good,"typical work day depends on how tickets flow determines how much work you do. Work with the company quite as while, several evaluations but never a increase in salary ."
good,Management not very helpful. Was outsourced to CSC when larger corporation bought out company. Really enjoyed working there before the transition.
good,"CSC, "
good,"There was No advancement in my area, partly because it was  Call center environment, there were favorite who got promoted within a week of getting hired."
good,"No Life outside work, expected to be available all round the clock if not future in the company is affected . Better to avoid working here for betterment of the health"
good,"The HR department started hiring below par people only from certain consultant firms to whom the said people had paid money to secure jobs."
good,"CSC contracted on site with Raytheon in El Segundo California. I learned the basics of IT from working there. The environment was very cut throat, the management was poor to say the least, and the compensation was mediocre"

good,"It is a good learning experience working with CSC. Working since 2015 on the current role, Currently, supporting the 725 users across globle."
good,"Large company, continually evolving. Not a bad thing, just evolved more than I wish. Overall a good company to work for."
good,Computer Science Corp is just like all the other companies supporting the US Military. Lowest Bidder Wins the Contract and lowers the pay of everyone on the contract.
good,"The biggest Pros with CSC were I always had very challenging roles and assignments.   Initial compensation can be very good if negotiated properly, but future compensation was stagnate.   I enjoyed working with the people I was surrounded by, but the management stream wasn't the easiest to interface with."
good,"A great place to save your vacation and then lose it due to always having to work,"
good,"As long as you didn't mind the shift work and the regular call to come in when someone else called out this made for a good entry level position into the company"
good,CSC is always about cutting cost and rehiring personnel at low wages.   If they cant find anyone locally they will ship the position to India.   CSC would rather re-train personnel instead of keeping their loyal employees on there staff.
good,"A sinking ship! Once a leader in IT services, CSC has now lost its grip on the market and getting ready to be taken over by some other IT giants in the industry."
good,"There is simply no telling how long you will be employed at CSC, and it has little or nothing to do with performance."
good,9 hours of work daily with no time for breaks. Learnt new technology like SOAP. Co-workers are friendly and approachable.
good,"The pay was good, and the work was steady and rewarding however the atmosphere was unfavorable as their was not any positive mamgement personnel."
good,There was nothing CSC did to help anyone to grow. No plan was ever introduced to increase our team knowledge of the work we did. So from the positions we held these was no upward mobility.
good,It was comfortable the job was OK it was a long drive the hour's were always changing according to how we were meeting our slave at the time. No raises
good,"While employed at CSC, I advanced quickly because they preferred to promote from within. The hardest part of the job was, because we trained troops, we got sick frequently and there was no compensation for that."
good,"I worked here for 9 Years and never got a raise. I love the people I work with, just not the upper management as regular employees were never compensated."
good,"I was called twice by India to resolve a CICS issue they did not know how to fix,  Its very fruatrating to be called by the people who took your jobs to fixwhat they could not."
good,"employees benefits are poor, no room for advancement, upper level management boast about profits but lower end employees cannot get a raise.  Company makes too much profits not to share with employees."
good,"the job required design, code and use of a network data base on an Univac-1100 for a manufacturing management information system, a material ordering and tracking system and a manpower management system"
good,"As this is an MNC, Work culture is very good and you can learn many things as it have strong clients across the globe, but there are no employee benefits since long time and There is no Job security in this company."
good,Not a good atmosphere to work in.  No direction or support from managers.  Managers have distant relationships with their employees. No training tools provided
good,"Lots of changes, different company from when first hired. I was able to work remotely 100%, the only benefit.  Turn over was high, extremely challenging to find knowledgeable resources."
good,"My co-workers are all social worker. The hardest part of the job is the preparation during exposure trip like orientation, attendance. The most enjoyable is I am able to help other people at the same time working efficiently and effectively/"
good,CSC is a good place to work. Good work life balance. Fun and laid back culture. Considerate with needs of the associates.
good,"I regret working for CSC. It was good experience (as I learned to play ping pong there) but it could have been much much better. What you want from your first company is growth in both skills and finances. But here, you won't get any of the two. Also, appraisals were poor and they don't work on increasing employee motivation."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Needs management interaction and proper training.  Company has lost focus on employee development. The hardest part is being micromanaged.
good,"I am working for 15 months, Got a good learning about the Global Client. Good work culture and process knowledge."
good,Great job.  Learned about State department.  Management was there to help.  Also looked into getting you extra training when needed.  Co-workers were always helpful.
good,I have worked for this company for 3 years now and in the beginning it was an interesting place to go learn more about corporate america. As time went on i found out that CSC did not offer any kind of appreciation for being a good worker or make any of its employees feel comfortable in the work place.
good,"The company would change policies and NOT tell people it affected.  When the government contract changed hands and our positions were cut, the company did nothing to try to retain us or assist in finding other positions"
good,"My time at CSC was interesting. I loved working with the Federal and civilian agencies regarding computer forensics. Having a pre-teen daughter and being a single parent, I learned a lot about how to protect my daughter from child predators."
good,"No comment at this time, as the company has a ways to go in shaping itself for leadership in the future.  I'd recommend everyone interview them, as much as they interview you!  Good luck!!!"
good,Offer Competitive wages so a person could survive and support ones family. Create a positive work environment with activities. Promote with in with seasoned agents.
good,"Unorganized - management didn't know what it wanted to be"
good,"The management is too bad and loads of  politics in the company. No scope of growth and the managers are very cruel. The HR is also not upto the mark, no help extended to employees."
good,"People here are really helpful,hardworking.I see an environment where sharing the knowledge is plays a pivotal role in individual's growth and improvement in career."
good,"Loved working at this restaurant. Just not closing the store by myself after 8 pm. Very dangerous. Fresh product, good food, and most of the Managers were good to work for."
good,"As long as you perform and be in a project / Program it is a good place, else you need to be constantly looking for opportunities inside / outside. Few policies are good in the company"
good,". They do not give out pay increases to lower level employees"
good,"The folks I worked with were great. Some were a little stuck in ""this is the way we do things"", but were always open to new ideas or new ways of doing something if you could explain the benefits."
good,"We have a 5 day SLA to process Purchase orders.  We get the requisition, look at it and decide if we need to go out and get other bids or have an Agreement associated with it.  If we have an Agreement we just process the PO, if not, then we have to get Price List, Certificate of Insurance (if applicable), Non-Disclosure (if applicable) or go to another vendor and get quotes.  Management is there if we have questions and co-workers are always a big help.  I love working on the computer and helping people out."
good,The job at Computer Science Corp was a step in the direction of Information Technology Security jobs. On a typical day I would answer the phone. Check backup that completed on the Excel sheet. Log tickets and issues in the production turnover. I would log and create tickets for the backup failure rate Excel sheet. I have found that my coworker were enjoyable to work with for the most part. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communications and the long shift hours at 13 hours per shift.
good,Your senior executives need to be re-assessed on their ability to manage and keep people productive and energetic . Managing by fear will not keep your best performers when the job market improves. Time to clean house .... and you have more Presidents than in a stack of dollar bills.
good,"Was with CSC for 31 years. The last 2 years were the worst. When there is work to do, then the days are busy and fulfilling, but when there is no work and management is willing to help, then you are on your own."
good,"The company is only financial minded, they have taken on a client that they can't properly accommodate and the employees have to make excuses for the incapability of the company. All they are concerned with are having bodies there to take the calls. The communication is awful and the morale is very low. Hard to keep employees."
good,"processing of changes on homeowner insurance policies including cancellations, address updates, and premium changes. works without little supervision am trustworthy"
good,Worked on a foreign military sales US government contract providing support to foreign military pilots undergoing qualification in an advanced military helicopter with a glass cockpit. I am a fully qualifed trainer that was not able to utilize my full skill set due to a culture that does not recognize non special operations qualified personnel. Management appeared not to be very concerned with quality of life concerns of the employees on site. The only time we received consistant inquiries from management was if there were concerns on maintaining the award of the contract in force. I did have two coworkers one was a dedicated and dependable coworker who was fine to house with but the other had personal cleanlyness issues that made him a challenge to house with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the cultural differences. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay.
good,"CSC is a good company and I am working there as a system admin, and my total experience with company is nice. This is the first company of my professional career and I am happy with the working environment."
good,I worked for this company and left for Maternity Leave. When I returned (on the previously planned and scheduled day) I was told my position had been given to the temp that had taken my place when I left. I was told that she dressed more feminine than I did. I am disabled and needed to wear specific laced shoes. I dressed in black slacks or khaki slacks with polos or blouses as did the rest of the all-male staff. The employer knew of my reasoning for dressing the way I did.
good,"i joined @ 1979 in CSC, learned a lot here and learning, i have got good experience and working with 22 team members."
good,"Work is on project to project basis. If you don't have another project lined up when your current one is finished, you're gone"
good,"Fast paced very technical co.  Numerous meetings. SLA driven goals. When people left the co, they just spread the work load to the remaining employees."
good,"CSC no longer exists.  It has been split, merged, and finally bought out by GDIT."
good,"Most managers are able to use unfair practices to make business decisions. I am neither for or against the company, there are both pro's and cons depending on who you ask."
good,"As one of the ""big 6"" there are lots of challenging opportunities available and many talented people to work with.  Benefits are good and the new flexible vacation policy is nice."
good,"My time being there wasn't great, the manager really didn't care about you in my opinion.  I was told that I would have one position but was given another."
good,"Doesn't recommend as there is no job security, don't get much learn and grow.Salary will be reasonable based on the project.Never expect good hikes as well."
good,My typical day was to take inbound phone calls for different contracts but my main job was assisting with registration of Job Corps students. My team mates and Leads were wonderful to work. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to help and assist with teenagers that had difficulties enrolling with the program.
good,The company as a whole is great unfortunately some of the management teams was not ethical with many company policies where they should have been upholding the core principals.
good,"Good Work/Life balance"
good,Worked with dynamic team on USAF contract. Very fortunate to have worked for my manager. Interacted with USAF and government staff to deliver network services (LAN/WAN).
good,"It was a pleasant friendly place they try to make you feel at ease and part of the call center family. "
good,"CSC has taught me many things that is needed to grow in future. Be it excel for preparing report or handling quality calls with onshore people. Management, particularly mine in quality team, is cooperative and always gives you opportunity to learn new things"
good,"The company has supported  the local, state, and federal government for years with much confusion internal. The people that strive to be professional and effective are pushed to the side. There is a lack of professionalism."
good,"you have to find your next project on your own. In general it is okay company as long as you are on a long term project, once you are done you need to find another opportunity right away."
good,"I have worked with Computer science corporation about 2.6 years, however workplace was good as team  support was there. Nice commute facilities was provided by company."
good,Nice management for .. Not much pressure. Work life balance is also is good. I'm in a healthcare project. utsav and more cultural activities. Workplace culture.
good,"Management is more inclined toward shareholders value. Work life balance is good, depend in which project we are in. Management need to have more focus on employee growth."
good,"I worked in several departments. annual reviews were difficult to get accomplished based on the revolving door management .  it was a close to home job,  when I initially started with CSC I had great management and the ability to work independently.  as my titles changed it was hard to do based on so many management changes."
good,"Work at home is the only benefit.  No raises, no advancements. increasing insurance premiums, increasing work and standards without overtime, pay increases or bonuses"
good,"No matter how hard we work, there wont be significant recognition. No increments, no promotions. Technically a well organized environment for learning"
good,Management was great here. They really care about you when you are sick. The only thing I would recommend is making sure people are fully trained and understand something. You do get abused by the callers a lot which can affect your health after a while. There's also no pay increases and insurance is expensive if you want the better insurance.
good,"Quality but less work, good work life balance, work culture is average, campus need infrastructure improvement."
good,"Good location, satisfactory facilities, but not good at compensation, would not recommend a final destination company to settle."
good,"Three reorganizations in 6 months was unacceptable and extremely difficult to establish trust, loyalty and a strong value propositions."
good,Difficult to be respected by client.  Suggestions were often scoffed at.  Eventually they kicked CSC out and brought HCL in.  They are now missing CSC!!
good,"All in all, a decent place to work with good people as long as you look at it as a temporary stepping stone. Don't expect to ever get any raises, whatever you get offered coming in is most likely what you'll make for the rest of your employment. Not many people enjoy working here."
good,"The higher ups are just trying to make money. Raises are slim even with the best appraisals. "
good,"CSC is Excellent company,I have learnt lot of things there,work environment is too good,people love to work there.co workers are very much supportive."
good,Company is headed in wrong direction. Not adapting to changes in IT field. Stuck in 80s. Job stability questionable in near future. Little room for advancement unless you're willing to put in 6 years at same position. Very boring and dull environment. Lacking in advanced technology.
good,"I loved doing the re-inspections during and after an Hurricane."
good,"CSC started out to be a great company but with the new CEO, started to let Wall Street drive decisions vice main street.  This affected CSC's ability to look out for the employees resulting in a corporate environment where the employees felt that they were not part of a team -- more like dollars or stock prices.  No advancement, no salary increases, and deflated evaluations not linked to actual performance leading to reduced morale within the workforce."
good,It is a good place to learn and grow. The work culture can be boring at times and the Cafeteria is not good. But on the whole CSC is a good place to learn and grow professionally.
good,"Typical work life balance culture"
good,"If you have a good manager, you will have a good work experience here. However, I found that favoritism allowed some people to become managers who might not have been thoroughly qualified for the position."
good,"A typical work day at work is getting there early (5:30am) and logging attendance for the day, updating/optimizing schedules, running daily reports and addressing any ""ad hoc"" issues that may come up."
good,"This was WAY back in 1994 and 1995. After serving 8 years in the U.S. Air Force at Hanscom AFB in Bedford MA, CSC hired me as a Banyan Vines NOS Server Administrator. Worked with some great team mates at CSC and we worked very hard over the 18 Month period that I worked there, building approx. 80 Banyan Servers, mostly DELL, WANG and AST models. And delivering them to the various organizations on the base and helping the local orgs Network/Server Admins set up the servers with File Systems, Printer cluster queues, and Access rights setups."
good,"My day consisted of incident management and hardware/software installation for several hundred employees both local and remote."
good,Last 3 years have been immense learning about service mangements and ITIL operations. A close peek into cloud computing. You get exposed to the latest technology and a great source to learn and exchange you knowledge.
good,"Friendly work place, good sense of community"
good,Over all CSC is a decent company to work for.   It is a large company with many account. Advancement in the company can be limited by geographical location.
good,"I enjoyed my time at CSC but due to a recent company reorganization, job security is a thing of the past. You constantly feel as if you are going to be laid off and never have any sense of being comfortable. It became a toxic work environment."
good,"Challenging, but compensated well. The most difficult part was being away from the States and family for six years. Iraq and Kuwait really challenge who you are and even teach you about who you are. The money was great, but sometimes you realize that money isn't everything unless you have good people to share it with, family. I met many great people that have touched my life and will continue to do so throughout the rest of my days. Their influence was that powerful and more helpful."
good,"Un día típico consiste en gerenciar una operación dinámica, administrando el personal de una manera eficiente de manera que se pueda brindar una atencion personalizada y rápida al publico."
good,I am working in CSC from last 2 years almost.The work environment over here is good.
good,This company is a decent company. Wish they would work on their lower level managers. They tend to look out for themselves
good,It was a good company with smart technical people.  Unfortunately it was not doing so well financially at the time and this made working conditions difficult.
good,I do not wish to write a review pertaining to the company at the moment. I am focused on seeking employment else ware at the time and that is where i would like to focus my energy.
good,"CSC was a great place to work. The level of work was challenging. The company did a great job of showing appreciation every so often. However, compensation for your daily work load and responsibilities was not enough. They were not willing to compensate their hard working employees. They'd rather lose knowledgeable and experienced workers and hire new and no experienced workers for a cheap rate. There are no raises given and no room for growth. Yet, you'd receive more work for another title. Ultimately, overworked and underpaid. Benefits were good, however. Management did an great job managing and delegating work but suffered with communication skills. They knew who their employees well!"
good,"Lotus notes administrator and troubleshooting issues with lotus notes software and Outlook 2013/2016. Created lotus notes accounts, terminated lotus notes accounts , created mail-in databases, groups and generic accounts. Moved mail files to improve server performance. Recertified lotus notes IDs and generic IDs. Changed passwords. Assisted users with installation of lotus notes software to their machines. Created entries in the Remedy Knowledge Base to aide users and technicians. Processed lotus notes mail file restores. Assisted with Lotus Notes email upgrades. Worked and resolved HelpDesk tickets via the Remedy system. Hardest part of job was being on the phone for the majority of the work day."
good,I was able to learn a lot while working at CSC. I was promoted to a team lead rather quickly. I was entrusted to run the day to day operations as an acting supervisor. I was entrusted to open up and close the job site daily.
good,"A high call volume, fast paced call center environment. Overtime is mandatory at times and certain times of the year lunches are not given and meant to be taken at your desk while working."
good,"Throughout the last few years, the company has gone through many changes and cut many good people in aefoort to stay competitive.  Seemed like there was no reason or formula to choose who stayed and left the organization."
good,I performed some database support work and wrote an ETL program. I was there for a  brief period. I worked with a team member who was vaguely familiar with the task.
good,"If you are talented(Not sure) and get along well with the management, client as well as peers and of course if luck strikes then you can have plethora of opportunities."
good,"CSC was a excellent place to work as far as gaining experience with auditing and assisting with developing programs. My team members were excellent however, since it was a temporary job there was always new people."
good,"work life balance is good ,nice environment, no hikes,no benefits,no   transportation."
good,Nice place to work. good working environment but work is not appreciated. Poor management. No hikes low salary for offcampus candidates.good technically we can improve
good,"I've enjoy working with my co-workers for 19 years. They are very nice people. I 've learned so much about life insurance, mail, scanning, imaging and indexing files and correspondence. The relocation of CSC to Plano, TX is not convenient for me because is too far away from home."
good,When I joined in 1998 it was a great place to work. People focused and challenging projects. This culture continued for many years but over the past few years revenue is everything so a major redundancy programme started and I ended up be made compulsory redundant in 2015.
good,Constantly overworked and little to no support for understaffed projects. Salaries are at the lower level of bands and advancement is difficult given budget constraints.
good,The company is so big that they forgot about how to treat people. Most people in the defense department area are not qualify for the jobs at all. They don't verify resume for qualifications.
good,"I enjoy working with the people, we're like a family. I know my work inside and out, I am the ""go-to"" person for many issues and I love it but the entire department is being laid off before 12/31. It is bittersweet, I do not want to look for a job but I know there are many opportunities awaiting me."
good,"My latest adventure with CSC was scheduler and Major Incident Manager (MIM) Lead. I managed the work schedule for 30 plus employees which covered a 24x7 shifts with all variations of days and hours.  I also approved all vacation request for our team and made sure we had adequate coverage.  As MIM lead I not only worked along side other MIMs but also manage them and was their go to person for any issues.  I worked remotely.  As MIMs, we were responsible for managing any IT related Severity 1 or 2 incidents that came in.  We would engage Techs, Managers, log events that took place to remedy the issue as well as send out status notifications to the clients and management.  This is a very high stressful job at times.  Co-workers were great to work with. We all were there to assist and  aide one another when we had questions."
good,Not a lot of room for advancement for outsourced workers.  Hard to maintain a sense of belonging to to the company with all the organizational changes.
good,"It is an okay place to work, but there is no career progression in this job. Most of the people who work for this company are contractors so you could possibly be laid off any day."
good,"Management does not care about employee."
good,Great place to start your career but not a good place to grow. There has been a lot of job cuts. Management is reasonable in terms of productivity from the employees. Co-worker are nice
good,was hired as a mechanic but the management made clear we as mechanics need to clean bathrooms. they could hire a local company and pay them $10 verse our 27 an hour. Safety is more important cleaning a bathroom.
good,"Need to be self driven and secure your own projects"
good,"CSC is a company which helped me gain a lot of technical knowledge. It was a good mix of work and play. Management is ok."
good,"1. Good Management."
good,"CSC overall is well balanced company.Due to so many organizational level changes it is randomly going under change."
good,The management needs to be revamped. The work was fine. The client was fine and I enjoyed until we got new management.
good,I already had varies skills when I started with this company the turn over was very often. My co-workers were great to work with the management was not so great.
good,"A typical day is very independent at CSC, it was not a very team based environment at all. You were expected to do you job and if need be ask for help."
good,"Typical day at work is incoming calls."
good,"1. Good cultures"
good,"My time here was as the network voice and data administrator"
good,have a team meeting on the goals of the team & how much work needs to be done by close of business
good,"Job work/life balance is good."
good,"Ability to work remotely full time from home with small percentage time working at client' s location as required! Completed several large ptojects with minimul supervision. It was a client's contract for primary support, so there was no advancements..."
good,"Learned a lot at this company and the people were nice."
good,Well managed IT service provider company with highly experienced management team who don't want others to grow. They always have a plan for team members to to get skilled but never implemented.
good,Happy and recomendable work place. Very friendly staff and good environment. Secure a challenging leadership position by applying (creative problem solving) and (fine management) skills with a growing company to achieve optimum utilization of its resources and maximize profits
good,"Usually start off as contract-to-hire and then hired on within 6-12 months. If you do your job well and can adapt and learn, you will do well. There were not many advancement positions at all."
good,"As a contractor were able to accomplish objectives, had a good team to acccomplish project objectives. A great location to work, work was fun and challenging"
good,"At times it was difficult knowing positions were being cut."
good,"Over all, CSC was an ok company to work for. There was no room for growth but i was in no danger of loosing my job. I was there for three an a half years with no change."
good,"had a good trainer so I could learn my new job. it was a tough transition to the new contract had a lot of training in the beginning, we developed a coaching team to help people through the process"
good,I like the job and learned that many people lives were in my hands so I learned many things were important to give the customer so we were liable for the info given to tem
good,No review as this company no longer exists.  This used to be Computer Sciences Corporation but is now DXC.  Had to enter this as it was required for Indeed.
good,CSC was a good place to start out but the pay and benefits was not enough to keep people. It was commonly used as a stepping stone.  Everything seemed to be about numbers to them and not about the people
good,My position with Computer Sciences Corp was a contracted temporary position specifically for one of there customers. Everyone one on the team were very friendly and we all worked together to complete the project at hand
good,"I worked on a large international project. The work was interesting and good. There were a few issues as is common on a large project. Overall, I liked working for CSC, but was often reminded that CSC tends to layoff people that are on the bench. "
good,"A typical day as a security guard consisted of monitoring the CCTV cams that covered all of the building, it's stairwells, parking garages & front/back exits. Management was OK. Workplace culture was OK. Hardest part of the job was the boredom of just monitoring the CCTV cams all day. Most enjoyable part was going home at the end of the shift."
good,Hi good morning all this company enjoying and lot of experience was done and I am good working person and I have learener and fastly solved trouble shooting actions.
good,Company was a good place to work for and allowed me to transition from the military and still work in an area that I am comfortable and confident in working.
good,Did not work long enough for this company to make a good opinion on how to rate this company as it was just a interim owner that later sold the company parts off.
good,"Working with CSC has been a roller coaster. Not your typical ""call center"" as it has more of an office feel. The management is not horrible. The training is minimal. Lots of learn as you go. Raises go unheard of. 5-6 years now that my co-workers have not had a raise. After my review I had great feedback but financially NOTHING. The office is clean. Work from home systems are not the best."
good,I really loved working at Computer Science Corporation. i really learned a lots about death and burial insurance. I always tell people to make sure you have them both
good,"I spent several years working for CSC - first at the USPTO and later at NOAA. Within the contract team, it was a good place to work. However, management would not accept reality much of the time and would not address issues. The main one had to do with work hours. The government required that all hours be recorded accurately. CSC said the same thing. However, if extra hours were required to meet schedules, management refused relief on schedules, yet insisted that all hours be recorded accurately. Finally, they refused to accept more than 40 hours per week regardless of hours actually worked. This always left the employee vulnerable because it was impossible to fulfill requirements."
good,"Good place to work"
good,The company provided all the necessary backing to perform my job as an Oracle DBA.  They allowed you to expand your knowledge base through online training.  Good compensation in the way of benefits.
good,I worked at CSC on the Raytheon account many years ago.  It was a fine place to start at.  I was a recent graduate and they hired me to work at an entry level position.  I gained a lot of knowledge in the time I was there and was happy for the opportunity.
good,Answering phone calls for policy owners and agents.  Giving accurate information on every call and showing empathy to those who call in to file a death claim
good,The job would be your typical IT field job consisting of assisting with tickets that users have submitted. If necessary I would travel to location to fix any issue.
good,"good insurance. + OT available."
good,"Worked as contractor, good peers but the job was boring. The product was an Unemployment Compensation automated calculator. Hours were 8 to 5. Cafeteria was nice."
good,"Worked with the company briefly on third shift.  Was a good learning experience.  Helped give me experience for future employment.  However, third shift was a tough one to work."
good,CSC was a large company where they lost focus on employee training needs.  Focused principally on customer billing and revenues.  No training provided to learn about company tools and apps.
good,"HHMM???"
good,Provided quality software engineering work to Citizenship and Immigration Service. Performed Requirements Analysis. Wrote Software Design Specifications.  Coded Mainframe COBOL and JCL processes.  Implemented and supported production programs
good,"My review was excellent every year, however my manager was forced to reduce my ratings. I was never given any explanation for this. Although I signed my reviews, my signatures were not mandatory."
good,"I was with the company since it was EDS, HP and the CSC. It was a great place to work and I made a lot of friends, some of which I continue to keep in contact with on a daily bases."
good,This was a very chaotic place to work. The company is to large and unorganized to function properly. Many clients were not served well do to the company not being able to focus on any particular client.
good,the work at computer science was very detailed and very fast paced.  The compensation and benefits were pretty good the job security was also fine.  The management not so good.
good,"The hardest part of the job is to assure the communication between different support groups is efficient. When each party understands what to do, working on the solution is just a time issue. It is the most enjoyable part when the jobs get done and beyond."
good,My experience at CSC was good and I learned a lot while there but did not feel that I had advancement potential and the career path I was planning on pursuing.
good,"Fast paced enviorment, always something new to learn. Lots of changes constantly from week to week. Coworkers were great. You do always have to be there, so if you like to take a lot of days off this is not the place for you. Although they are very good with letting you take off for Dr appt's if you have them. There are no snow days here. There is always plenty of full time work avalible. Very hard to get part time here. There is a big turn around in coworkers and its hard to advance here if your college days are over."
good,Friendly culture in work environment .Good benefits are provided to employees. I had learned new technologies and worked on many tools. Good experience working with this company.
good,"Work life in CSC is very good. One will have less work pressure. And also the management is very lenient towards the employees compared to other MNC's in IT industry. It is an awesome place for freshers as it teaches the best traits to survive in any multinational company. But due to the bad time running in csc it is focusing more on cost cutting which is directly impacting on employees, resulting in some negative consequences. And the huge layoffs which happened recently had made the employees to be under the pressure of minimal job security."
good,Productive.  Enjoyed conducting the job but the management was less than desirable.  Had a few issues with the top management and decided to move on...
good,"Encouraging People. It is a fast growing organization having competitive environment. Encourages new ideas and new talents."
good,I enjoyed very much the work that I did at CSC.  The work was not boring and each day brought a new set of challenges.  Hours were long.  My manager and the people I worked with were great.
good,"First IT job, very relaxed.  Work place was at Naval Air Station in Pensacola.  First job experience working with COBOL, JCL, TSO."
good,"CSC is a good company to work for. Work environment is challenging"
good,Not a fan of being a contractor for the fact it is not necessarily long term and does not bring the stability needed for raising a family.  Contract ran out and nothing was available in the area.
good,This is a good company to work for. The hours were great & you got to do fun stuff for every holiday. They people that had been there for a long time were great.
good,the staff was amazing.  I loved the hours I worked.  I liked how the company made the employees feel welcome.  If you should have a problem whether its is work related or personal you can speak with any supervisor there without any judgement
good,"good company to work but but its more management oriented."
good,"Company was preparing to be sold at the time, all employee benefits were being terminated, no raises, no bonuses.  Employee morale was very low and the CEO was preparing the company to be chopped up and sold off."
good,"Its a good company for experienced people but not that good for freshers who are starting their career, the opportunities are limited and the scope of the work which they are assigned is also very narrow."
good,"CSC provided some really good benefits and paid well, however, I never really felt safe the 13 years I worked for the company. Management turnover was very high and it was standard practice to have 2 or 3 different managers or supervisors within a year. Decisions were all made by upper management who were really disconnected from the workforce and daily operations of the company. At the end of the day making/saving money by replacing skilled workers with inexpensive offshore resources is more important to this company than providing good customer support to clients If you prefer an environment where you are just a number then this is the place for you."
good,"Good work life balance - poor senior management including a lot of redundancies. Working out of office 3 days a week, and at home 2 days a week. Projects are innovative and allows you to learn a lot of new skills."
good,My time was short with this company as a I was a temp.  Did meet too many people but I was a learning experience being a temp for the first time.  The most enjoyable part was that I live very close by the job
good,"Very less opportunities for team members to explore and improve skills. Very conservative management, less flexible in movement of team members."
good,Now management is just passing time. Now its not really a good company to work for. They will only ask you to do things their way- no matter if its feasible/right thing to do or not
good,"Overall nice company , nice work culture , nice management , average salary"
good,"Excellent opportunities"
good,"Company is good , but its vary from project to project , if your project and manager is good then you can see your carrier's growth here, at the sametime if your manager and project is not so good , then you should move either to new project or new organization."
good,"The office environment is very positive with coworkers who are always willing to assist and help out with the new learning experiences.  We are a team that supports each other and cares about our personal lives as well.  When information is not explained or transferred to us properly, we have a way of researching all of our resources to get the job done correctly.  Prior to working in the living benefits department at CSC. I had no knowledge of insurance claim work or the systems used to evaluate and review the claims. But, I have gained an enormous amount of confidence and experience in this short time to work with clients and customers very effectively."
good,"Nice Company to work and play... ;)"
good,"I liked the individual cubes to work in and a chance to work from home.  Some of the co-workers were friendly.  Because my supervisor was a smoker, we had shorter breaks, but more of them."
good,"Hard work makes the day go by faster."
good,good opportunity for beginners and good exposure to the IT Field. Working at company provided good experience and knowledge gain . lot many employment development programs held. work-life balance .
good,"I started as a CSR for an in bound call . worked with the Medicare part D. I worked on special projects. I walked the floor and assisted new CSR""s with difficult calls. I trained CSR.s and piggybacked. Then I was promoted to Quality Assurance department. I audited calls, Wrote reviews and coached the CSR's."
good,I have not worked there in a long time. So my memory of the job is a little eschewed. I really don't remember the environment there.
good,"I worked one of their help desk as a remote employee. I was working in one department as a remote employee and then was transferred to another area of the company. "
good,"Worked remotely in my personal office"
good,Company faced challenges every year and was always  making changes and reductions every year. Compensation often time did not match the job role.
good,"CSC is about to merge with HPE radically changing its culture, go-to-market strategy and overall value proposition; change has been difficult for CSC to there's considerable concern about its ability to sustain business post-merger"
good,Configuration of  UCaAS/HCS systems for Lockheed Martin/Sikorsk. Configuration of call center for Freddie Mac. Management over for daily run and maintain.
good,NOTHING TO SAY THIS is a temp company no security only get pay for holidays after 1500 hours of work Nothing much to say about this company
good,"The merger between CSC and HPE has left me with a sour taste, but before this merger, the company was awesome. Good luck to anyone that works there in the future, I wish them all the best."
good,"Co-workers generally easy to get along with.  Management variable, some very competent, others incompetent.  Upper management does not seem to appreciate the grunts.  Many inefficiencies in how things are run.  Best part of the job is working from home and flexible hours.  Worst part is no job security and no raises."
good,"Each person's daily work at CSC depends on their own manager.   Because CSC is international, each area focuses more on itself"
good,"My first IT job, learnt the processes of product development and work culture in corporate. Learning to adapt to this."
good,I really enjoyed working here it was a great experience great people. Awesome organization. Would recommend anyone to give this company a second look.
good,"CSC is undergoing a great deal of business and organizational changes. They recently split into two companies - federal and commercial. My focus was the commercial side for the Americas region. This included many of CSC largest accounts such as General Dynamics, AT&T, etc. My focus was primarily new business pursuits and the expected resource needs once contracts were won."
good,"Good Working Environment and pay."
good,"Great place but not for advancement  - If you want to get ahead or clime the ""corporate ladder"" you would've had to been there for a number of years and know the right person... Hence being there for certain amount of years (maybe 10)."
good,A good place to start off one's career. The environment is laid back and one can learn a lot about themselves as well as the company.
good,Too many changes going on with the company and rotation for management and employee are constant.  Some would thrive in this environment.
good,CSC is a very large company with lots of government contracts and personnel. My experience with CSC has not been the  best among various companies that I have worked for. Management only is concerned with employees if it appears that the employees conduct will affect the status of the contract otherwise it appears that management is not concerned with the satisfaction or growth of the employee.
good,I have made a lot of new friends at CSC. Training was hurried to get you out and on the phones.  The hardest part is having to tell someone they have no life insurance after paying premiums most of their lives.
good,"Worked in an inbound call center processing background checks for FBI NICS project. NICS stands for National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Those businesses that sold guns would call us, we would key in the customers information and tell them they could sell the gun or transfer them to the FBI."
good,Helped me to make my basement strong in the Skills I have consumed . Good projects going in the company helps to find more opportunites to learn .
good,Hard to spend time with family. Worked a lot of holidays. No raises. Benefits were expensive for what we were paid. Management were in clicks with certain employees.
good,the hours were the best even though most people wouldn't work the hours that i did. it was laid back and we had fast paced work as well. met a bunch of new people that are still friends to this day.
good,"Was not there long enough to provide review. Compnay I worked for (Nichols Research Corp) was acquired by CSC. Worked as a graphic artist creating briefing slides, proposal graphics, illustrations for technical documents."
good,"Busy everyday"
good,"CSC provides fairly good amount of training to the entry level job seekers. "
good,"I enjoy the challenge this job gave me, Great boss and great co-workers, I am not sure I like these reviews."
good,"CSC has very intelligent professionals that are willing to assist any way they can. Management is always willing to give you all the tools and training to help you be successful, The hardest part of the job is working with people all over the world so time zones often time become a factor"
good,Overall good working culture and process oriented. Have good portal for learning.Friendly co-workers.
good,Management was not very professional but other than that a nice place to work.
good,"Good work to gain expertise."
good,"Working on projects is always interesting, always something new to learn. Meeting new people either within CSC or with our Clients. Excellent exposure to how other industry runs and manages their internal IT Environments. "
good,Lot of on-going change in Leadership and org structure. Management is always challenged with cost cutting requirements. The people are great. Best part of job is ability to telework/work from home full time for multiple years. Lots of professional growth over 15 years.
good,csc is a good company to work for. Good employee work life balance and benefits.
good,"Call center environment, day to day operations smooth.  Management absent most of the time.  Good pay though and monday through friday schedule a plus."
good,Nice people.  Traffic has become an issue as it takes a while to get on base at the check point.  Most employees are frustrated with the low wages.
good,Working for CSC is some times difficult and can consume your entire life if you let it there is always something that needs to be done.
good,"I worked on the Textron account for 4 years, I managed the data center and all new Hardware procurements."
good,"Nothing. I do not wish to post anything to review for this company. Anything anyone wishes to ask, they can ask me. I will not post anything online."
good,In Computer science corporation the best thing is flexibility in job . the good job atmosphere
good,Worked in India on Lifecomm system (Mainframes) for Hartford Life
good,"CSC to start with was a good company, a typical day at work is a queue full of IMAC/ODBC calls. Allot of physical labor was involved with this job, with is not a bad thinkg as i was able to keep myself in shape while working. The management at first was top notch, then our manager quit, and another one came in and he changes the whole spectrum and outlook of all the desktop techs that were in my group. Very condedending to my team members and myself."
good,Cubicle farm with no chance of advancement. Typical call center environment.
good,Work life and personal life is balanced. Good company to work with.
good,"Trainers was amazing, kept you on tract made sure you knew what you was doing before you went out on the floor, kept in a bay instead of a cubical, Co-workers and management was always friendly and on task."
good,CSC is a good place to work. They are serious about their mission to support the client while at the same time maintaining profitability.
good,Small company with very few openings. They are a contracting company
good,"Great Project staff to work with. Open to suggestions to continue mission of keeping a aging spacecraft operational. Excellent team work on project. Job security wasn't an issue, everyone on the team was willing to share their knowledge and cover other's jobs when personnel where absent or on vacation so there wasn't work stoppage.Remote location from main office, our support staff took care of use so we didn't have to travel."
good,Makes for a long work day but enjoyed working with others nearby.
good,good people to work with; good managers.  good communication with employees.
good,"A great place to work, I truly enjoyed working with the soldiers and NCO's."
good,"answer questions on job assignments"
good,Had a very good experience in CSC. Learnt new technologies and tools. Bagged many enjoyable moments and experiences from CSC.
good,"Working here I have learnt a lot.  How to work faster and be accurate."
good,"High turnover rate, was not able to form full opinion in such a short span of time. "
good,"Job has it's ups and downs b/c of nature of work (which is confidential), had to leave due to a family medical emergency"
good,"Dot com bubble burst as Nortel's IT support was  migrated to CSC.  That in combination with offshoring of work to India created a very negative environment.  I enjoyed the people there, but shrinking my staff from 14 to 3 was not fun.  There was very little work other than system decoms and offshoring, so very little to stimulate creativity."
good,"Company is fair, but sometimes feel lost in the mix with the large corporate culture."
good,"It was great to help to troops on this contract. The company had good people, but could use some professional management classes. Tough position to be in between the government side and company. Had a lot of fun with the personnel on-site."
good,"It was one of the great company to work with, unfortunately its not the case now."
good,"Good staff and middle management. Work well as a team, and were very productive."
good,Processed mail and opened and prepared for scanning for use in a paperless environment.
good,Good company to work with. It has multiple locations across the globe for a candidate to pick from
good,Benefits could be better but work schedule is very flexible
good,Nice environment and work was fine but did not like the yearly contract never knowing if you have a job next year.
good,The work was broad in scope. I gained experience in underwriting along with processing automobile policy changes.
good,- Review Issues Account has on a daily basis. Communicate with Client on a Daily basis about new issues and old issues that have not been fixed
good,A typical day at work would be coming into a friendly office where every one is a team player so we can get the job done that is required from us. I have learned everyone has different personalities and everyone is not going to be the same. I didn't work to long with the company to really get to know the management team that well but I can say my supervisor and manager for the office I worked out of always had their employees best interest.
good,Management help define work task and environment. encourage after work activities volleyball games for bonding.
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"Was an excellent place to work 18 years ago, work place environment was positive, supportive, management had your back and kept in contact regularly when working off site, but then things changed, we tended to blend in more with the client than our own company, until 2015 the only time I saw a manager was on our once a year review, apart from that we only got phone calls on the unrealistic expectations of why were missing the SLA's when trying to solo support two very busy sites. You come to a point where enough is enough. The colleagues I worked with were excellent techs, some of us are still in touch,  they wanted out as well and are now very happy in there new jobs.  Support your staff in high demanding environments, and they will support the company."
good,"I was fortunate to experience a lot of changes during my 17 years with CSC/DXC which helped me learn a great deal about mergers, acquisitions and managing change within my work environment."
good,"Great teams. Some management willing to listen to your suggestions and put into practice,Multiple contracts never boring always something new to learn"
good,It was a great place to work.They are flexible at times. And I got a chance to learn different tools and most of the time the management is supportive.
good,"Training opportunities to learn more skills are limited.  I did the same job for 13 years, barely learning any new skills.  Raises were few and far between.  Every year or so, the company underwent re-organizations, putting us in different teams with new managers.  Even the managers sometimes got shifted around, so nobody really knew what we did except for our teammates.  The company is constantly laying off people every couple of months.  Keep your resumes updated if you work for this company - you never know when your number will come up."
good,This job was a US Government site with little room for advancement. I did learn a lot about Windows and Windows Network Management. Pleasant place to work. A good job for someone needing experience as a Hardware/Software Technician. Not very challenging.
good,"Good place to learn new tech."
good,"It was a good place to work, but very few opportunities for career growth as well as personal development. But the work life balance was mostly achievable."
good,Good Company but growth opportunities for very less and high politics and so many changes are happen at management level because of merger with HP and new company named as DXC.technology
good,Great place to work with lot of opportunities to grow. Management takes care of the employees & look after the requirements.
good,"Typical day at work will start at 08.30 and go through until 1800hrs (later at times)."
good,I liked my time there and learned a lot while doing my job. Good people and interesting projects. I got the chance to really work outside my comfort zone and take on new challenges.
good,"I would like to say that I enjoyed my earlier years with the company.  nice and friendly people there,things started to change when a lot of layoffs and budget cut, organizational changes. Then it didnt to be as good of in environment to me"
good,"I learned how to handle a team in system testing. I am the one who make a test plan, attend triage for defects. I handle the team during test preparation and test execution. I am warranty and uat support also."
good,"Company focuses mainly on cost optimization. Revenue growth is achieved through acquisitions. Organization is flat and there are only few job levels available."
good,"When you come to work on a typical day at CSC you never really know how things will go. You hope that things go smooth through your entire shift, but they can change in a instant.   Things may be going smoothly one moment and in an instant a virtual host goes down and along with it you might have over a hundred servers that also go down and you have to have a SRT (service restoration team) call in order to work to restore service as soon as possible.   Things at CSC also always different depending upon which account your are working on any given night..  We are all cross-trained in multiple areas so we are always able to switch off and cover other account in cases of emergencies or short staffing."
good,"Computer sciences corporation has good work life balance but salary and increment is very low."
good,"Steady reliable work. New technology. Good Co-workers. A typical day was 90% desk work developing with Oracle. "
good,CSC's environment was Challenging due to the ever changing requirements of a Global company and the deployment of the Human Resources systems to other countries.
good,"Good place to learn"
good,"Good experience with versatile projects and scope to learn, However at times that makes the Hectic."
good,I work an eight hour day answering calls all day in relation to life insurance policies. I have learned a lot about the insurance business itself. My team leads and supervisor are all wonderful people who are flexible and extremely helpful. The hardest part of my job is that training is not quite in-depth enough before being put on your own. I enjoy the people I work with who truly support each other every day.
good,A good place for any freshers to develop their knowledge from scratch. Enough freedom to implement innovative thoughts. But growth and development is highly concern. Also company doesn't seems to be concentration on Next generation technology.
good,"Overall good. Good learning. "
good,"Basically the same thing every day."
good,Job description did not match actual duties in role.  Management only worried about SLA metric and training was insufficient.
good,"For the people who enjoys their work CSC is a good place to work. Apart from work company there would be many extra activities which will help us to improve our own skills like confess, Management trainings, Business ethics.. etc.."
good,"Nice place to work with relaxed environment and nice people "
good,"Work environment is plesent and not much work pressure."
good,Good work experience. Working with people having an average work exp of around 20 years which was a huge benefit.
good,"A typical day at work begins with logging directly in to the work management system and beginning processing inspections and other underwriting duties. We are required to have 10 inspections reviewed per day, plus all of the other work items that have a time limit on them. Our division has been outsourced to a homeowners insurance company in another state. The other company makes all decisions regarding our jobs, to include making us work on holidays, firing anyone at will with no questions asked, and require a standard of work be met on a daily basis, regardles of how many inspections come in and how many employees have recently left the company. Each underwriter is watched on a daily basis to meet they meet their requirements. Salaried employment is no longer allowed, only hourly emplotyment with no option for working overtime. I love underwriting and have always wanted to be one and I enjoy the day to day work within that parameter. The management and company make it very difficult to be productive."
good,Each day is a creative think tank that surrounds me. People are trying to find solutions in the different areas of the business. I have learned a lot about how to get around on the computer. Management will listen to what you have to say good or bad. The hardest part of the job is monotony. The most enjoyable is when we come together as a team.
good,"My review about computer science is totally depends on which project/account I was working. As per my experience CSC is great company if you require some secured and smooth job. But if you love to learn new things and you are workaholic, you should opt for this company in later stage, at-least not on starting of your career"
good,This company is fast paced but depends on you learning about their processes by means on learning modules on line.  There are a lot of different systems to learn.
good,Enjoyed working here with very knowledgeable teams.  Limited opportunities for training. Changing environment due to merge with new company.  Typical day of working on new task with supportive team members.
good,"CSC keeps you busy; however, you are told that the positions are temp to perm.  Yet it seems like the practice is to hire someone else after 3 months."
good,A nice company intially. Now not a good organization to work. Not good projects and no learning. No hikes and HR is very weak everything in control of managers
good,"It was a productive workplace, where you could come in and get your work done easy, you also had the help you needed. you could also work from home if you needed to the company provided a choice."
good,"Very friendly work environment, great managers and coworkers. Extremely restrictive movement monitored constantly, professional courtesy is not part of policy."
good,Company in transition period focusing on new methods and initiatives for growth. But lacks in execution because of poor senior management
good,"There are many ups and downs in CSC work life. But -ves dominate the benefits."
good,I worked a 12 hour shift as a ISR staff member giving over watch of the entire base and Convoy over watch for soldiers on patrol. The hardest part of my day would be loosing a soldier to a IED.
good,I would rather not give my opinion. I am still employed and I have my familt yo think about.
good,"Lack of career development"
good,Work hard. But no bonus. managements was good. Cowoker was great. I learned a lot
good,"I like my colleagues, my biggest gripe is how the sick leave and vacation is set-up. You accrue about 1.5hrs a week for each, you can  only use whole days at a time (right: no half days or anything like that), you can only use what you have a accrued. It takes two months to earn a day. Ridiculous!!!"
good,The Company is exactly what I expected out of a large company.  It is too big. 
good,I have got very good oppurtunites in CSC and have found that this company has great policies and defined procedures for employees.
good,No training provided to further career advancement
good,"Computer science it was a nice environment to work and very productive place to work, also a place to learned something new everyday that improved your career."
good,"Company overall is good to work for. CSC was divided up into 2 separate groups; CSC.GOV and CSC, then CSC.GOV was acquired by SRA and became CSRA."
good,"Its a tough industry, but CSC helped shape it. There were challenges and pain, but all in all the mood was good. "
good,"CSC is a fun-loving place to work, depending on the team you’re on. I’m a member of the quality/disbursements team, and its a fun team. I'd say, join us!"
good,I worked for CSC for a good 3 years span and believe that the company has great work life culture.The compensation is still something the company needs to think and take care of.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Good place to work. "
good,Friendly work place. Supportive employees and management. Learning scope is good. But no sick leaves concept here. Salary and hike are not great.
good,Good environment to work. I am able to balance work and personal life.Very friendly colleagues. I have learned new technologies and handling critical issues.
good,"Day starting with reviewing the previous day's work report, end with better performance.Professionalism was the most learned thing at CSC.Manger and Team Leaders were supportive and co-workers even more. Saturation point was the hardest part so taking up the responsibility of something new time to time was important. Learning new things was exciting."
good,"Good Company to work"
good,"A typical day at CSC is to be here at 7am - 4pm with two 15 minute breaks, and an hour lunch break ""unpaid"". I will come in and sort the life insurance correspondence into bins and piles to go upstairs to the company teams for them to work on. We have had many lay-offs leaving us with no on-site manager, and no on-site Human Resource Representative. My co-workers are okay, but because of the lack of work lately, we are all just turning into mindless zombies. We all preferred to be busy no sleepy. There is really nothing hard about the job except for figuring out vacation days between our very few co-workers."

good,Working for CSC was diffewrnet since they were located outside of Indiana. All contact with management and company was via phone or email
good,Good company to settle down. Work life balance is good. Management is sensible. But getting promotion and advancement all depends on the project you work and how much your current manager knows about you as every project switch will land you with new manager. So you can say it's hard to get promoted and defenetly your designation gives your next project so you end up doing same kind of job for years. Otherwise good.
good,"CSC was a good starting job, as I was fresh out of highschool when I worked there. Inbound calls checking and verifying visas for pending clients. It has since been taken over by another company."

Management is wonderful and understanding, and the people there are helpful and friendly. I most enjoy working with my colleagues; however the pace of the work can be a bit slow."
good,Lots of training oportunities and very helpful people. Typically you are able to keep yourself pretty busy depending on what you are doing for the company. Management is always helpful and will work with you through any issues you may have. Most of the people of each team are easy to work and are usually full of knowlege and experience to help you out on whatever you may be working on. This is a very large company so the hardest part is just navigating through the many outlets that are available to you in order to resolve an issue.
good,"Income is tax free, living quarters are provided, meals are provided.  I work 12 hour shifts.  Schedule is supposed to be four days on and three days off, but typically we work five or six days a week."
good,"i got a chance to learn insurance domain, i have learned how to work in corporate, management of csc is wonderful, i had always work life balance in CSC, nothing was hard in my job, the most enjoyeable part of my job was there was no restrictions on break time, i would never leave this job if i had any option to stay in Noida."

good,"Learned many new things."
good,"CSC India pvt ltd, is a good example of work culture with diversity."

good,Worked at remote location. Subcontracted through Insight Global.
good,"working at CSC was a very stressful job, but i did love it. they decided they did not need us anylonger and decided they would outscource our department"
good,"Working for this company was okay, however, their lack of compassion and understanding when they laid me eroded much of their good impression with me."
good,"A great place to work. productive days and fast past days. i like how somedays we are extremely busy and others are kind of relaxing. Management is great, understanding, and considerate. the hardest part of my job is working in freezing cold weather other than that this job is Amazing. I have developed friendships with my co workers. the most enjoyable part of my job is computer work."
good,"Went in to work at 6am till 2:30 pm.  Did my job to the best of my ability.  Had some awesome friends that I worked with, they made my day."
good,"Typical day at work is really crazy "
good,Would maintain all equipment used in the training of military and law enforcement at a mock city training facility. Most of my time was spent cleaning cameras and mowing the site. Actual job duties would be few and far between due to training cuts in the military.
good,"Learnt for the first time msdos and microsoft operating systems. very memorable time. good co-workers."
good,"My experience at CSC was hands on. There is no direction/management or onboarding. As a Contractor, you are expected to earn your salary from day one."
good,The company is good to work but the management is very bad. Work environment is good. Good place to learn and facilities are good. But there are few managers not good at all and always tries to dominate you

good,"I have learned new technologies in CSC."
good,Enjoyed working on several projects and enjoyed working with management.  They were able to put me on several contracts and paid for my graduate school
good,ABC...you'll win.  The company has definitely been in flux over the past 10 years.  With the recent HP Services acquisition many opportunities may exist if you can withstand the ambiguity.
good,"Whilst it is challenging at times colleagues really do make the day to day worth while."
good,"Its good to work with CSC, but pay will be less, Its great working with CSC,u can find time for family"
good,"You need to be self directed at CSC.  You have much autonomy and little supervision.  That works fine for me but many people tend to coast in that environment.  So to get things done, you must develop relationships with key people in the organization and communicate often and in multiple ways.  You can't rely on the organization to follow thru...you must direct the activities you need to be done.  Co-workers are friendly and professional for the most part.  Some are a bit clannish and resistant to change.  That is to be expected.  The hardest part of the job is getting people to do the things they should be doing on your behalf in a timely manner....without being obnoxious or forceful.  If you like being your own boss, and being self directed and initiate your own activities...its a good place for you."
good,"Where once CSC was adept at balancing employee culture with the drive to succeed in the marketplace, due to recent market changes, leadership philosophy changes and the dynamics of the organizational reorganization, CSC is no longer known as the place to work."
good,This was my first job in private industry after working 37 years as an air force civilian.  I did not have any pre-conceived notions or a metric to measure the company's performance.
good,"A typical work day for me start at 7 am. I check my outstanding mails and get all my morning reports sent off. I have an extremely difficult co-worker (Manic/Depressive, insulting and generally not cooperative. He is more senior than me so it is a fairly difficult environment to work in."
good,"Work was great, especially when over time was available. I handled users with many different systems and levels. Management are great people but sometimes hard to get in contact with."
good,"Again, the interview process at Indeed is just too long. You really don't know when to stop asking questions.  Blah, Blah, Blah Blah and Blah Blah some more."
good,"I had the opportunity to gain a new skill set.  I'm thankful for the opportunity.  However, I have a problem with managers giving an assessment of staff members they do not interact with on the daily basis."
good,A great place to learn. All they need is better management team. Great colleagues. stressful time shift - 12 hours shift - 2 days morning then changes to 2 days night immediately.
good,"Nice place to work. Good project Managers, Lots of scopes to explore into new things. Work-life balance well maintained. and career growth is good .and, at last, had a good start."
good,"CSC is making an effort to transform their legacy technology business to a Cloud first / digital solutions business.  The result is significant attrition in leadership and overall staff.

good,"Good place to work, decent work environment, good pay, good benefits, good management, I would work their again, basic IT work for the most part, nice workers (Numont Contract)"
good,"OK. High pressure because of the customer (government). Management is usually sub-par, but one of my managers addressed a bad manager issue the way it should, and removed the problem manager. Hooray! After that was resolved, the job got notably better. More or less, I learned a lot from the job, it wasn't bad, but I could have made 50% more given I was doing the same work as the higher paid engineers. After working there two years, I should have been made an Engineer 2, since I was working far more complex and important projects than the others. I took the lower position only to get in the door."
good,Job entailed preparation of system move for overseas operational support.Normal I.T systems management and culture. Job was typical programming type support function and included ERP extract and load activities. There was no excessive level of difficulty
good,Good place to work. Had to prepare your health for the three shift work.Enjoyed working for the management but was in distrust with the management when the reduction in force happened.
good,"I was a Range Maintenance Technician with CSC at Fort Knox. Our contract was suppose to be for 5 years, but came up for annual review, and the government decided to end the contract, even though they had just spent several million dollars upgrading to a TRACR."

good,"Management was not the best and the project on which I started was lost to due to their lack of vision to make it happen. In the end, the company cancel the project that had so much promise."
good,During my six years working with Computer Science Corporation LLC. I gain a lot of experience and the know-how knowledge to complete the projects with the best results.
good,"Looking back I should of stayed, the company liked it when you worked at home. They left you alone to do your job. The only interaction with management was when you needed to explain variances or changes to budget/forecast."
good,"At this time I have no statement to make for this position as it was so long ago and would not be applicable for any ones review or time to read.  If you read this I apologize, it was required."
good,"I worked at CSC full-time"
good,"Great place to work. I was treated fairly throughout my career. My only complaint would be work/life balance. However, that was in 2011 :) I am sure it has changed by now."
good,I enjoyed working on different projects both onsite and offshore. It gave me a tremendous learning opportunity and chance to work with a very fantastic team.
good,"Suppose to be a 6-month temp to perm position at SEC. After three months and once the iaudit was passed (showing they had documentation), the government changed its mind and decided they did not need a technical writer."
good,I was working as a management information mgmt (MIS) programmer and solved some very challenging problems and I was also selected by the director to manage a software development effort at an offsite location and accomplished it within cost and budget. So my experience was a good one for a very junior employee.
good,An enjoyable company to work for. Learned a lot from senior technicians to improve my skills of fabrication and installation of wiring harness assemblies.
good,"Good company to work in..Work culture and environment great"
good,Working a typical day is pretty good as they are very relaxed and give you the material needed to perform your work duties the only thing I would say that could be approved is the actual monitoring they can be a lot more helpful instead of being judemental and give positive advice to improve te CSR call performance
good,"Since its a service based company we should not expect much out of this in terms of benefits. If you want to learn or gain more knowledge, then join here. Good place to work for."
good,Here my work and life was balanced. Got good career growth and good numbers of on-site work (especially US). Unfortunately offshoring Projects were less at later years.

good,"Overall Good, Good Work culture, Flexible work time, Worked for a project named Integral Java - which is a general insurance administration system."
good,Management was great here. They really care about you when you are sick. The only thing I would recommend is making sure people are fully trained and understand something. You do get abused by the callers a lot which can affect your health after a while. There's also no pay increases and insurance is expensive if you want the better insurance
good,"Good work culture"
good,"Good work life balance, talented and helpful co-workers. The company offers good benefits.Annual raises are not so great though. Occasionally had to work after hours."
good,"nice place to work for freshers but salary is low."

good,"Flexible schedule and it is hard work work, but very enjoyable. Access to multiple area of the business, products, and program allow for huge personal and professional growth. Over the last year business has been reshaped to include working with new product categories and new programs."
good,CSC has been a great company to work for.  I been with the company for almost 5 years. The team is great and there is a strong bond between the employees.
good,"Working for this company inspired me to join the military because of woking side by side with the Air Force and other branches. I guarded the gates of the Air Force base. Checked identifications of the personnel gaining access to the base. I supervised the night shift, of five guards, and prepped the day shift guards to open all other gates."
good,A typical work day at CSC is promising. But CSC is so diversified in various locations that very less projects are based out in Bangalore and hence i am forced to move out to look out for projects. Also i got my H1 stamping done from this company. In between they have to reduce the billling of the project and was forced to move out of the project to reduce the cost of the project.
good,Overall Loved my coming to work doing my job. Not mictomanage and great place to work....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

good,"Every day is typical at work because challenging work seems to be typical and efforts make them easy at end of the day. Learned a lot and groomed my skills as much as I can. Management is awesome but some flaws are there which can be ignored. Colleagues are friendly and helpful. Every one wants to get praise with money and promotion if he/she put their best in the whole year but if bell-curve ruin them at time of appraisal that's the hardest part of job. Being a workaholic person, I enjoyed my work that the most favorite part of doing job."

good,"Overall good pay, decent hours.  The management is great.  Getting time off is impossible without the accrued time which can be frustrating."
good,"Typical work is client-centric, mostly on site. Your time with other CSC employees is dependent on your specific task. Many CSC employees send the majority of their time with sub-contractors and government clients."
good,Computer Sciences offers a wide variety of IT careers in state and overseas. This company would be a good choice for college graduate.
good,"A typical day for me starts at 7:45am and does not end til around 4. In that day, I check my email first thing in the morning. I then review documents.I go to lunch.

I am in a warehouse but have a small office dedicated to my job in the back and also keep the cages we store our supplies organized and open for new shipments of PCs and monitors. I don't see many co-workers as I'm on a night shift position which is also the hardest part of the job. Being alone on my shift is also enjoyable at times since it makes it easier to focus on any problems and come up with solutions without distraction.
good,"I am no longer employed at this company. they had gotten away from being a people friendly company. and a whole lot of uncertainty and very little communication from management,  however iam all the better for the learning experience and spending 22 years there with friends"

good,"A on a day to day basis we attended daily meetings. There was a lot of information to know and understand and remember. "
good,I enjoyed my experiences with co-workers and customers and gained a great deal of experience supporting large scale complex IT environments. I would recommend this company to anyone who wants to learn how to work within a very large global IT organization.
good,Computer Sciences Corporation was a great opportunity. I worked at three locations over the 5+ years I worked there. I was given a great deal of opportunities along the way and my database programming skills were gained during that employment. There was a division consolidation and my employment came to and end.

good,I worked for CSC for 6 years. My co-workers I worked well with in our job duties. I learned a lot while working there. This was my first job experience with insurance. I was trained for my job duties which also taught me to be flexible. The work atmosphere was professional but it was okay to get to know the people you worked with. Management was willingly to work and help you  when it was needed.
good,A very good organisation with high respect for every individual and i would say it's almost like a central government job.

good,Good place to work with a great staff.  Was able to develop as an individual by learning multiple skills and gaining supervisory and team leading experience.
good,CSC was a nice place to work at and the pay was great but some of the upper management staff there are so poorly educated on how to deal with people and a lot are not qualified for their jobs.

good,"CSC offers contractual based employment opportunities for many different career paths. It may not be as easy to work on the corporate side however, contract opportunities are plentiful. My only issue is your job security is up to the contract lead you work with as opposed to a Project Management Office. Not a good culture for advancement in my opinion."

good,"I have been with PAE for about 3 years, since they bought the division of CSC that I was with.  The contract I am on is pretty hands off from the executive level management.  Most of the executive level came in and visited shortly after they acquired us, and they mostly seemed like good, down to earth types."
good,"CSC was a great place to work.  It now is no longer the same company, it used to be.  A thriving company with many contracts.  For the past 5 years it has been focused on re-inventing itself and downsizing and outsourcing most of its core business. I really miss the old CSC."
good,"management is good, I learned a lot from here because I'm working in a project that is using all the latest technologies. Co workers are friendly and helpful. But the company is not good in case of hike and increment."
good,It will be my remarkable experience with CSC that I will not forget in the future as well. I got a great learning experience. The re-organisation of the company seems very productive for company as well as for employees.

good,"Typical day consists of supporting Royal Mail staff with any IT related queries they may have, from a broken PDA to a slow PC. The management and team leaders are all level headed and up for a laugh but remain professional at all time, a hard balance to keep but one they all find. The only thing that lets the service desk side of things down is the progression scale which remains fairly flat for those without qualifications in IT, even those who's experience is of far greater worth."

These are the hard part of project experience and the best part is we got some challenging tasks which has limited time and we managed to plan accordingly and complete the work before the given time.
