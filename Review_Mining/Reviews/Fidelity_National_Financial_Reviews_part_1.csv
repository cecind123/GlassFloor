rating,review
bad,"Run. Run as fast as you can. This company is STILL run by nepotism, favoritism and fear despite several lawsuits. Save yourself the trouble and stress by seeking employment elsewhere"
bad,No overtime pay. Any work over 40 hours is without pay. Management does not keep you updated with new updates throughout the company. No personal life.
bad,Employees on check team are cut throat if you are not part of the clique. They will lie on you to management especially the Team Lead.Dont waste your time.
bad,The job was easy but it was not stable. There were people leaving and comin gall the time. In particular there were college graduates fresh out of school taking others jobs.
bad,I hated everything about this job. Different lunches everyday and no room for growth. This is probably my most least liked job ever. Pay was ok for my age and needs at the time
bad,I gained vast job experience that i can use with other jobs. The pay was ok but i was hired to do one job but was given 5 other jobs to do. To much responsibility for one person to undertake. I was made to feel like an outcast by my manager and fellow co workers.
bad,"Overtime every single day, turnover rate is high, poor management,"
bad,"Worst environment I've ever worked in.  Management was terrible, had no clue/involvement in our project.  I was a contractor, that was promised a permanent position within 6 months, and that never happened.  Then they ended my contract with no notice, and I had done a great job for them."
bad,"The company does not stand behind its employees, has leaders that bully, micromanage, and lie.  They tell contractors that they will go permanent within 6 months, and never convert them to full time.  I know contractors that have been there for years.   I would not suggest this company to anyone."
bad,This is the worst company to work for they treat the employees in the call center terrible. They do not care care about the time & days they make you work. The management is oblivious to people that make the money for them!
bad,"This is by far the worst company and place to work for. Senior Management is the most worst part and benefits add to that as well!"
bad,I worked for FIS as a Business Analyst for four years. I was responsible for file manipulation and transmission of said files for community bank clients. Typical day involved answering the phone and assisting clients with problems and helping them with solutions.
bad,Management is running the company into the ground and no one seems to care.
bad,"Management yells at you all the time. People are backstabbers at this rotten company yet the CEO of this dump pockets over 25 million a year in bonuses! While people suffer with $12/Hr pay and on top of this, they outsource to India! Keep the jobs in America!"
bad,"The manager was a dictator. She would never ask but tell. It was her way or the high way. If you could tolerate her militant style ruling behavior then you will do well. This particular department was just a data entry role and you were forced fed documents to code and enter into the system and lordy, please don't make a mistake because you would be openly reprimanded."
bad,decent workplace very flexible and reliable. Not the typical call center work enviornment managment very helpful.
bad,"This is a very unorganized company. There is a reorganization every year and unfortunately, since they are just moving the same problem employees around, nothing ever changes. They don't promote from within, raises are non-existent and morale is terrible. I can't think of anything good to say about it."
bad,"high turnover rate, very few promotions within company"
bad,"Bunch of people only concerned with their job descriptions, wasting time,  and taking care of themselves.  Outside management breaking functioning processes."
bad,Good pay good benefits but the management doesn't care about their staff. You will work yourself to your grave there. Sick or almost dying they will fire you when they call an ambulance for you because you went to work sick in fear of losing your job. Oh I forgot to mention mandatory overtime is a must and if you don't you will get in trouble for it. Worst place ever to have has worked for. Fbefore they fire you they will use you to work your shift then at the end of day they fire you
bad,I enjoyed being crossed trained into billing and other fields of the company however the potential for advancement was not merit based.
bad,"The worst workplace in all of my 13 years work history, no ethics, high turn over. The whole place stinks. The only place where I have seen roaches roaming freely. Needless to say give yourself a break and don't work here."
bad,A disgruntled employee lied and used his ethnical race to avoid failing his probation and made up lies to make 2 of his senior managers resign. The HR team are useless and suspend employees like running water - avoid the Birmingham office at all costs
bad,"This has to be one of the worst jobs that I've ever had.  Promises not met, contractual obligations ignored, conversion rate no where NEAR what was discussed.  Everyone protects their jobs and the information therein like it was the early 1990's.  Ridiculous ""hoops"" to jump through to get basic work accomplished.  Managers have little to no experience managing Senior level people."
bad,"Executive management does not operate in conjunction with management reporting to them. Goals were unattainable and attrition both voluntary and company imposed layoffs created a stressful, but predictable path for each year of failure with consequence."
bad,"My tenure at FIS was the worst 3 years of my professional career. Lack of direction, no vision, lack of leadership, no true strategy for managing client delivery or expectations. Global Commercial Services needed a major overhaul. Account Executives were inexperienced and poor communicators. Client expectations were ever-changing and, at times, were orchestrating our daily operations."
bad,Not a good work environment. Poor management. Benefits are the worst I've had in my entire life. It's in house so you work 9-5.
bad,"I've worked at the company for several months and witnessed the weekly firings and job abandonment. There is practically no job security here and everyone works under the mindset of ""Well, I'm probably next."" Few make it past their first month of work and it's rare for some departments to hire more people to fill vacated spots, leaving an increased workload for those who remain."
bad,Desk job with little opportunity for advancement. Non-attorneys complete the same tasks as mid-level attorneys.
bad,The County Manager and her leadership team are more concerned with the corporate bottom line than the retention of good employees.  Everyone in my office is scared that s/he is the next on the chopping block.  It doesn't matter if one has worked here for one year or twenty.
bad,"Employees are required to work (for my role) on 12 hour roling shift schedule, on a salary with no OT benefits.  Immediate management was poor and guidance for new and upgraded systems was provided only after an issue.  Very little consideration provided to employees personal affairs and is very unflexable to work with."
bad,"If you are looking to relocate within the Tampa bay area and is in a financial bind, FIS would meet our needs due to the mandatory OT.. But if you're looking for a career this Is not the place. Really high turn over rate"
bad,Taking payments for the IRS. I learned a lot about the IRS. The hardest part of the job was the negotiation of the payments that the customers were paying.
bad,"Extremely corporate; little chance for advancement. Same old ""i know more then the boss'. Individuals may be good but the structure doesn't reward competency."
bad,"overall, okay job...............there are many processes and procedures to follow....lots of forms"
bad,As a fresh graduate getting an opportunity in a MNC was great exposure and experience. I was given the opportunity to work under an expert in the field of Human Resources.
bad,"micro management environment.  people are generally likes to help out, but since it's a call center you can't step out of the desk more than 10 min.  HR do not know any answer when anyone asking about the benefit or the 401k."
bad,"Most agents are required to work Mandatory OT."
bad,Mainly a sweat shop from what I recall of my time there. I do remember this was the place that was hacked long after I left. Sad sad culture of despair.
bad,"Unless you are really good at being a brown-noser, working with this company is stressful and unfair. Not recommended for people who have a life and a family."
bad,Peers are very helpful. Management has no support for current employees and can’t retain quality employees due to poor management! Constant resignation and turn over which will have you working overtime and weekends due to short in staff.
bad,"The management all depends on what department you're in.  Some managers like to micromanage and abuse their people, while others use positive reinforcement.  If you are better than your manager, your manager will get rid of you. High stress, long hours, horrible health insurance. Hit or miss as to what is good right now.  I used to love it there, now that management has changed, they only care about the bottom line. Employees are talked to like dogs."
bad,The Management sucked . It was very stressful work life for me and my family. There was limieted advancemet opportunities with poor training established for new users.
bad,A typical day consisted of numerous reconciliations.  I learned about accounting and bookkeeping.  Management was not the best.  The enviornment was very hostile and moral was down.  Several co-workers walked off the job without notice.  My co-workers were great.  Everyone got along well for the most part.  The hardest part of the job was knowing that I was stuck in that department and could not transfer to another department because my manager refused to recommend anyone for advancement.  I enjoyed the experience this job provided.
bad,Management does not mentor or train employees. Not a family oriented company at all. Rampant internet use that is inappropiate because employees are not supervised or held accountable. Company does promote from within.
bad,"Not the worst place to start. Lots of autonomy early on, but without any real mentorship or training program. Very much sink or swim, unless your one of management's favored hires. Then you're on the fast track for promotions, raises, and laterals to other business units."
bad,"No care in the world for family values, its all about the numbers and no care for employees at all. Their way or no way. No consideration for the feelings of the employees."
bad,"Average Company. Not much to learn. Management is not good."
bad,Managing the procurement service from cradle to grave serving business units .The hardest part of the job is handling the work flow through the different time requirements of the US and APAC and the most enjoyable part is seeing a successful contract being renewed
bad,Unstable work environment unknown job stability non proper training to complete unrealistic job duties without the proper training your guaranteed to fail and be fired they view agents as sit holders and truly do not care about the retention rate of the agents.
bad,"Senior Project Manager, Project Management, Cambridge, MA, Massachusetts, Telecommute. Lead multiple initiatives crossing Optum Labs teams as a Senior Project..."
bad,"Out of all the places I have worked, This was the worst Company I worked for. "
bad,no stability. Hire people and let them go. Great people to work with.
bad,"You'll be very unhappy. Management is interested in, SURPRISE, Management. Their bonuses drive your directives. Slaving away. No special programs to mentor nor enhance. You're wasting your time idiot."
bad,Really i can't comment much on this. I was part of fidelity for just 2 months as management trainee. It was a good experience Not sure about culture or career opportunities.
bad,"great place to work at if you do not want to challenge yourself."
bad,"Team mates were great.  However, benefit packages were below industry.  No value for team mates.  No difference between contract or fulltime."
bad,"I really ca't say much about this company, it was a very very quite staff and the staff was very strict, etc."
bad,The wages were low for the type of work being done. The other benefits were not too bad. There was not much room for growth although it is a large company.
bad,"A typical day on the job in my fraud analyst position was reviewing cases for charge back rights in an attempt to recover funds for our clients. I learned about Visa and MasterCard regulations, federal regulations and the financial institutions guidelines on recovering funds from the merchants on behalf of our clients if these regulations were not met. I enjoyed my direct supervisor he was wonderful!  My management team had an open door policy and they were all willing to assist you with any concerns or needs to the best of their abilities. I enjoyed my co-workers and gained some close friendships. My co-workers were well rounded and had a great sense of humor we had fun on a regular basis. The hardest part of the job was the time constraints and contractual agreements we had to meet with the given workload, under staffing and computer systems we had to work with but we always managed to meet our standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about credit card fraud and the fraud recovery process."
bad,"I learned that a life work balance is necessary for success"
bad,"Good company, paying less, has to work in shifts which is not feasible for girls specially married. Job culture was quite impactive."
bad,"aprendi a ter menas vergonha,falar perto de muitas pessoas,amei os colegas de trabalho,o ambiente de trabalho a parte mais difícil foi que tinha que fazer muitas provas nos treinamentos,e a parte mais agradavél era o ambiente de trabalho..."
bad,"FIS have a very stressful environment. They are not flexible even if you have an emergency. They have a lot of poor management skills. I worked in the call center area and sometimes there were 4 agents taking calls more than half a day back to back. They send emails all the time about new procedures and about the company rules, but can't recognized your hard work."
bad,"The company has gone to the point that employees are just resources to be burnt.  For IT resource, long work weeks, work 3 out of 4 weekends.  Raises minimal after being hired in."
bad,"They have a great lunch room if you can afford to eat there, they still allowed smoking when i was there which you couldn't excape from during lunch outside."
bad,"Normal Company, needs lot of improvement at ggn location. Bangalore location work culture is good"
bad,"prepare closing documents"
bad,"very quiet work enviornment, fast paced .. easy to learn .. no real training class or enviornment because its a new department .. pay rate could be better."
bad,"Very relaxed atmosphere. People are awesome, friendly to deal with. There is not much room for advancement. If you are ambitious and perhaps a little younger, this is not the place for you. Management can be extremely rude and sneaky as well."
bad,"Ceridian contracted out my department to FIS.  I transitioned to FIS and worked the Service Desk and Customer Service for our external customers. "
bad,A typical work day was stressful but was manageable.  The company was no better or no worse than any other experience.  I was a long term employee and held many titles.  Advancement is slow.  Hardest part of the job is to navigate the corporate ladder.  Hard work is Not necessarily rewarded.  Clicks and office politics are often prevalent.  The most enjoyable part of my day was leaving for home.
bad,"Stressful, Lack of communication from onsite management of individual businesses. Complex understanding of organizational structure. Consistent change and hard work with little reward."
bad,"Learning curve is not that great,"
good,"The job is fine as long as you do not get diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder/illness or ever get hurt on the job. Unfortunately this company or at least the managers demonstrated a great deal of bias, which made the atmosphere uncomfortable. I would never recommend them as a preferred employer."
good,The compensation is below standard.  It's a fast paced work environment. Lack of work life balance.  Leadership is lacking.  Changes are slow to be made and opinions and ideas tend to be dismissed.
good,"Management rules with an iron fist. They refuse to shape a new employee into something useful, instead giving a hap hazard training approach before expecting unreasonable quotas."
good,Not the place to work if a person is looking to move up the corporate ladder and be compensated accordingly.  Annual raises are not given.  College degrees are not taken into consideration when it comes to compensation.
good,Sweat shop that has many disturbed people working there including young millionaires that love to do drugs. Not a good place to work. Since I left it is now a public company called Black Knight. Not much change i have heard from my friends.
good,"I wouldnt recommend it. Too much favoritism, To much downsizing. That's all I have to say. Thank you"
good,They do great gatherings for the employees. The hardest part about working  there is the management. There is no flexible hours for many departments and being able to work remote is impossible. The company does keep the building clean with bathrooms stocked on some floors. There is a gym but most the it needs to be updated.
good,"A empresa cumpre o que promete, o problema mesmo é que o trabalho é estressante e com folga apenas um dia na semana se torna ainda pior. Questões de horário também são impactantes. Você não tem garantias que no próximo mês permanecerá no horário. Mas a empresa paga o salário, vale alimentação, vale transporte sempre em dia."
good,"This job doesn't allow room for  advancement as a customer service representative, nor do you get a pay raise in certain departments."
good,hard road to advancement. I learned a lot about Data entry and career training.
good,This company is always in flux and there seems to be a glass ceiling that prevents career advancement.
good,Overall an ok place to work. A lot of do as I say not as I do. If you have any friends that work in upper management you are a shoe in for the job.
good,"They will keep more pressure to complete the work , the hardest part of the job is daily we have to extend for 4 more hours so the total of 13-14 hours we have to work. the salary was very less for the work we are doing."
good,"The work was fun and engaging; however, the production manager at the time lacked strength and any true direction. This would have been an awesome position, had there been stronger leadership."
good,"Job responsibilities were changed after about nine months with no training, mentoring or coaching.  Expectations were unrealistic.  Management was not concerned about associates, only bottom line."
good,"Mandatory OT, expected doubles, and expected to keep up with metrics just your typical call center environment. Unfortunately my location moved out of state but the one thing I miss about it were my co-workers. They made the day worth coming in and made it easier to deal with management not having your back. Turnover was crazy but hey it's your average call center expect to get burnt out within the first year."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people; I'm a people person. I will try to help in any way possible. If I can show  clients another way to budget their finances which in turn allows them to pay pass due bills, then great! That makes me happy too, and helping others is the most enjoyable part of my job. "
good,Very relaxed office environment that needed more structure from management.
good,"Production environment, fast paced. Nice location, great people to work with."
good,"Procuring goods and services to agreed schedules and one off requirements .Considerable interaction with key suppliers and key policy holders (internal)"
good,Certain locations were more important to the upper management.  Little consideration was given to raises and bonuses.  Work/Life balance and perks were very limited.
good,"Very bad.management not good. While I was working at FNF, we need to stay 4 hrs extra daily(forces). After one year quality issue.if employees work long time also they will send home without any reason."
good,The pay is not what it should be. Your work all holidays. The job should care more about their employees. You have to read off a script to the customers
good,"This role offered very good pay. However, the work culture left something to be desired. The training process was ok but did not prepare you properly. In some roles that would be ok if there was some level of OJT that filled in the gaps. Several of the team members had heavy case loads. This created a culture of everyone for themselves and there was no team support. Again really good pay but you must be prepared to figure it out on your own and possibly be frustrated while you do."
good,"I love my job here. My supervisor is great, most of my co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of my job is worker so hard for so little pay. No bonuses, barely any extra hours and the pay should be much higher."
good,Typical day consisted of about 150 calls. The equipment was inadequate for the tasks we were expected to perform. Compensation was not enough for the stress and amount of work you are expected to do.
good,My typical day started off with making sure all of my programs were open and ready to help customers. My manager was usually there ending her night-shift. She would let us know if there were any issues through the night with any of the systems or with the banking system. She would also do any employee reviews that needed to be done for the month. At 7am I would check-in and start receiving calls. The call volume varied from day to day. The best part of my day was being able to bring peace of mind to customers whose credit cards were lost or stolen when the cards were permanently closed. My co-workers were very helpful when I was not sure on a question when helping customers. The hardest part of the job was when the system went down for weather reasons and having to close cards down after rebooting. Every second counts when a card needs to be closed and that kind of set back can cost customers un-needed stress.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Lots of nice and knowledgeable people, but the work was way too much. They needed to add employees in certain areas. Employees had to take work home to keep pace. Family life was not considered."
good,"Successful company positioned well in the marketplace, however, you are nothing more than a number to these people. They spend so much money on their HR representatives, no doubt they have the top talent in the industry - all for the purpose of screwing you over"
good,This place has changed. No loyalty. No security. No fairness. They regularly clean house and replace skilled and well-regarded employees without notice with low-paying entry-level people.
good,I did not have a very great experience here. The management felt very stand offish and did not communicate very well. My workload never reached full capacity even though I continually reached out for more. It felt as though I was under some observation yet left to my own designs to figure out what the overall picture needed to be painted. There were certainly some coworkers who were helpful and friendly but the overall experience was puzzling. I think that for my particular profession they were looking for something specific but not very forthcoming on what that might be.
good,"Assist Claims Attorneys in managing workflow of the claims."
good,"When I was there as a pricing analyst the process was not automated.  Lots of paper.  The work was good, the process was outdated."
good,"A typical day at work found me processing back office work for clients such as Scottrade Bank, Ally Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, TIAA-CREF, and Barclays. I learned to recalculate interest and provide accurate spreadsheet summaries for customers, transfer funds using a teller application, change terms and account settings on CDs, savings accounts, and checking accounts, perform compliance testing for Regulation D, DD, and Z, as well as research problem tickets to resolve possible issues with accounts.  I learned to work on a team with others to problem solve as a group, and to lead that group when necessary.  I was chosen to attend a week of training in our sister Pittsburgh office to become one of our department's Quality Control associates.  The hardest part of the job was often balancing many tasks and clients at once, which became easier with time as I learned more advanced time management skills, delegation, and prioritization. The most enjoyable part of the job was always the feeling at the end of a long hour or two working a difficult ticket when I found the resolution to the problem so that it could be corrected for the customer."
good,Fidelity is a great place to gain knowledge and experience.  The responsibilities have the right balance of regularity with challenging project added.  The work is diverse enough that you get a well rounded work experience.  
good,A flat organization with the scope of putting your knowledge/expertize to work. Democratic management with supportive co-workers.
good,Stressfull environment but fast paced and fun.  My manager was very supportive of the entire team and could always be counted on to help.  Salary is poor and no bonus offered.  My manager left so I did as well.
good,"It was a temp. position, through a staffing company (AppleOne). I was only there for a month. I enjoyed being there, but wasn't there long enough to give it a fair evaluation."
good,"OK, but stressful, long hours and not a clear organizational path.  Had a habit of not treating employees with the respect they deserved.  People will work very hard for a company that appreciates them."
good,"Have learnt - People Management skills, Decisive making skills,Flexibility"
good,Supervised 25 Consultants on large project for 9 months and then traveled across the US to complete various Internal Audits and Compliance Reviews. Large corporate atmosphere. Many assignments you are able to work from home.
good,"When I started this job I was supporting 150 colleagues. As time when on, that number grew to around 350. It became very difficult to keep up to the workload and forget taking vacations or sick time."
good,The knowledge I took form Fidelity led to my ability to be very analytical in the financial arena.
good,My colleagues are a great source of energy. I have a vast excel knowledge which I have learned from this company.
good,I was an Implementation Analyst for financial institutions across United States. Products were average. Pay was below-average.
good,good workplace.good training and work culture.worked in best company with good salary.very productive.good interaction with client.helped in utilization of my skills.
good,"Work life balance - good"
good,The organization has a high repute in terms of the working environment. The organization promotes a healthy companionship and friendly attitude. working here will surely amaze you and certainly felt delighted. The management is the employee-oriented in the enhancement of your career and always supporting for the next best opportunity and to grab that
good,"I was actually very curious about reviewing this program because I had recently seen it on TV and the radio (and especially considering I had just finished two straight months of testing what turned out to be one scam after another). So I wondered, was it more of the same or would it actually live up to it's word? I really wanted to find out for myself, but I was still skeptical."
good,"Make sure your salary is good going in, because it likely will not get much better.  Am salaried, but normally work no more than 40 hours per week.  Stress level's are not high.  Culture in my department is low drama without worry of back stabbing."
good,"I enjoyed working at this company, family orientated, career advancement opportunities. Management wants you to succeed and hours are nice offering 1st and 2nd shifts."
good,"Great place to work "
good,É uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar.Oferece muitos benefícios.
good,"This company had some good people, but some bad policies and practices. Talent was treated like commodities. That may be true at the most basic level, but it sucks when you KNOW it."
good,The job offered monthly bonuses based on our overall job. The Job was casual and meet great friends. It was a full time position. I gained most of my mortgage experience at this company.
good,its ok if you like working 12 hours for 3 days and routing weekends every four months.. it can be repetitive but can also be challenging to meet deadlines and due dates.
good,"not enough communication between departments. FIS is a strong company that continues to grow financially, business lines and number of employees, both organically and through acquisition. The stock is on the rise and pays a small dividend. There are opportunities all over the world."
good,"Good work environment."
good,The company is very good and the working environment is awesome experience. Everyone is down to the earth. I loved a lot and I experienced a lot from the company.
good,"interacting with clients to address their queries and concerns."
good,"Atendimento aos clientes portadores de cartão de crédito, auxiliando em suas dúvidas, reclamações, elogios, cancelamentos, desbloqueios, resgate de pontos, ofertando produtos, entre outros serviços.."
good,"I work with banks worldwide and enjoy speaking to people across the globe. The work is very fast paced, and I work the 2nd shift. Looking for an 8:00 AM to 5:00 AM position. My skills and qualifications far exceed the position I hold with Fidelity National Information Systems."
good,Learned how to do Loan Modifications using a mortgage calculator. Taught me how to excel being apart of this company. Meet inspiring people and gained a great level of experience in the Real Estate market.
good,The company was indeed diverse.  I worked with people from all walks of life.  My work schedule was flexible.  The mangers were team players in this area.
good,Company is good in terms of job security but not good @salary side and hike. If you are looking for long term and you have good current CTC then you can prefer this company.This company is excellent for people holding more experience.
good,It is a great experience being a FISer . I learned so many things in this firm. Career wise this firm is a great place to work for. The management is ok
good,"Work prep, training, meeting work quotas.  Operating of machinery including folders, inserters, and forklifts.  Filled in other departments whenever required."
good,"Receives and reviews invoices from vendors, matches documents, codes and batches,"
good,Overall a good place to work with . Initially we built the co with a lot of values and culture.Open environment for learning and best  had the best co-workers and team..
good,"Though it was my first job, I had a very good experience and learned a lot.  I certainly recommend this company.  "
good,If you are surrounded among great people it makes it easier to want to be there. Had the opportunity to meet awesome co workers that would come together and work as a team.
good,Enjoyed servicing agents and customers through emails and inbound and outbound calls. Feels good when you know you've helped someone.
good,"the day was always busy and rushed."
good,"Developed solid call center skills thru career advancement in multiple positions, from a phone associate to the Global Director of Workforce Management. Great international and multi-site experience."
good,Fairly nice work environment with friendly co-workers. Good support staff but the overall job is stressful and demanding. Your breaks are only long enough to do one thing and you don't have time between each call to report what kind of call it was.
good,"You take about 100 to 150 calls a day helping customers and bank issuers with credit card fraud issues."
good,"Challenging environment and extremely long hours. Great people to work with."
good,"Responsible for executing audit procedures to ensure appropriate controls are in place and work is being conducted according to company policy and procedure.  Review the effectiveness and reliability of the company’s operational and critical processes.  These critical processes include revenue, accounts payable and receivable, payroll and commission, account reconciliation, information technology, banking administration, and escrow closing."
good,Ya i would say my first was superb!!! since as a fresher i felt the environment was too good because i entered the job as soon as i completed my college days so they gave such kind of environment and day by day i learnt how working days will go differently than college days and even my colleagues co operated with me to learn the process because it was one of toughest processes in the company and my hardest time was when i was teaching my trainies but i cleared it as easy as i would since i was having teaching experience also previously and i enjoyed a lot with process since it was teaching me new scenarios day by day.....
good,"Great company, and while it's still changing, requires individuals who are skilled and dedicated in the financial sector."
good,"Workloads are assigned (possibly multiple duties) and are generally very heavy in volume making it difficult to complete daily. I've learned several skills such as time management, effective communication, data analysis, investigative/research techniques and critical thinking. Management, in general, is open to communication. Co-workers are generally open for questions as time allows. The hardest part of the job is meeting daily production goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to research issues for resolution."
good,Fun workplace good people good policies good atmosphere learning new skills implementing new things responsibilities enjoy working management is good
good,"I've had a wonderful experience in IT with leveraging much freedom while balancing work loads to learn new technologies.  Though I was able to build more value in myself via continuing education, I was not compensated accordingly for the daring innovation I brought to my group.  Though I'm grateful to be employed with such a company, I'm also greatly disheartened as the salaries are way below national/regional averages.  This is the consensus for all FIS locations in the lower 48."
good,They out sourced which made me lose my job. This was not good after a merge.
good,Fidelity National Financial is a wonderful company to work for
good,"Good learning experience out of college, but the pay is below competitive. Nice co-workers for the most part. Stubborn and foolish managers."
good,"Days were fast moving, diverse and rewarding. Enjoyable experiences occurred. Operations Manager was a very rewarding position."
good,"Mortgage processing company. No other comments. Now LPS. In Jacksonville, fl."
good,"Fidelity National Financial has a wide range of technologies in the network/security areas. They have multi-vendor support across the various data centers which allows for a technician to learn and support systems from more than one vendor."
good,"It was good working for Fidelity and I have tried my level best to make the most of it. Working in night shifts gave me experience much more as compared to people working in morning shifts. I have learnt some of the applications used by the co how it has to be operated, moreover learnt the corporate world, how it works, whom to communicate, whom should be reported to etc."
good,"I worked a lot of hours, fast paced, and very stressful . the department was not organized with the training classes."
good,This is an OK place to work. Staff was cool. could have been better though
good,Learnt Audit Operations of ATM.
good,"This is a call center setting. Typical day is taking incoming phone calls from customers who has security issues of their card, who maybe a victim of credit card fraud. In addition, also call customers if there are fraud alerts on their card and confirm charges and transactions. The hardest part of the job is sitting down for long periods of time."
good,Last employed as employee of Metavante. Not familiar with current environment and management.
good,"I would take calls and emails throughout the day. I would train/manage several employees each day to improve at their job. I worked at Fidelity for 13 years and learned so much over these years. I answered phones when I first started then finally became Director, Vendor Management. I assisted the entire office with my expertise over the years. I would assist/resolve client calls and issues, speak with inspection companies across the country, Canada and Puerto Rico. When the customer service department could not locate a specific inspector for a property that needs an inspection, I would be the final route to locate someone. When I am given a task, I work on the task until it is complete. I like a challenge. The management inside of the office was great to work with each day. I worked with them for several years and maintained great friendly relationships inside and outside of the office. I was friendly with everyone I worked with. I enjoyed training them and teaching them my tricks of the trade. The hardest part of my job was speaking with irrate customers. We would contract inspectors all over the country so their eyes are our eyes. If the customer disagrees with something the inspector thinks, they would call me. But I would always make sure the customer is happy after I speak with them and resolve the issue. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I would be able to save the company thousands of dollars a month by reducing the inspectors fees minimally due to the volume of business we were sending them. The entire company would benefit from the savings myself and my associates"
good,The experience at FIS taught me a lot about myself. The job itself was challenging and kept my attention. The management and procedures the company acquired were not rated that high on my rector scale. Overall it was a bittersweet experience.
good,Provides free food. Secured job. There is no balance between work and life. Need to work on most of the weekends and overtime. Salaray benefits are not good.
good,"I learn a lot in this company and also worked on advanced Technologies like AngulaoJS, WEB API, MVC 5 and EntityFramework.Timings are flexible.It is contract job."
good,"Good company for freshers. Very good colleagues. Less onshore opportunities, Decent hike. There is always a chance to learn other technologies here. All the best."
good,I continue to enjoy my tenure at FIS. It is just that working in tax has meant that I have faced all the challenges there are to face. I am ready for a new challenge.
good,"Good work culture. Get all support needed. Working time is flexible and paid extra for the effort put for the work and dedication."
good,"The biggest issues come from executive management. They tend to keep IT support understaffed to meet budget plan. This in turn doesn't allow us to get our money saving implementations complete. "
good,"FNF was a fantastic place to work as it being a small company, provides lots of opportunity for people with potential to grow up the ladder.  The management always allowed you to experiment and learn rather than spoon feeding.  Day was always busy with people competing against each other to achieve their numbers and targets.  Co-workers were very supportive and had high regards for management.  The hardest part of the job was the rotation in shifts every month.  However, being responsible for large teams and the faith senior management had in us was the most exciting and enjoyable portion."
good,"Lots of overtime. Work hours are horrible, work holidays but you do get paid double time and a half. overall an ok company to work for"
good,"A typical day starts off with answering lots of calls when you sit in your seat. My job was really a nice job. I really enjoyed the people I worked with daily. Everyone always spoke to one another. My supervisor by far is the best, she's caring and shows compassion for all. I learned a lot at my job such as, better commnication on how you respond to not so happy customers. The hardest part is trying to juggle all the different products, but with persistence and a mind set to do well it can and was accomplished."
good,"Company overall is a productive workplace."
good,"I was heading the IT team at Fidelity National Financial India and managing entire IT operations. Weekly Management Reviews, Break the Mould, Floor walks, Meeting the Operation people understanding their IT related problems. Weekly team meeting and One on One with team members sending the MIS reports to Country Head and CEO. The hardest part of the Job was there was no domain specialist to manage the infrastructure. I had learned a lot of new management skills and technology Security products. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with our co-workers."
good,Difficult to manage a personal life and be a top performer. You almost have to choose one or the other. But they pay well and offer good benefits. So in all actually there shouldn't be anything to complain about. If you really are coming to work to work
good,"FIS has definitely taught me everything I know about the banking industry. My typical day includes creating an inventory report of what correspondence needs to be done for the day, then processing each request in the order it  arrived. I have learned how to manage my time to complete all of my assigned projects within the time allotted."
good,"learned to use multiple programs on multiple screens, great coworkers, best part was being able to help people, worst part was feeling like you could be fired at any time"
good,"I have been there for almost 18 years though many acquisitions and closing of departments. I have been able to work in a variety of departments and learn many different things. The hardest part sometimes is working in the large company environment, while I like more of a personable environment. Best part of the job is being able to work with people on a global level."
good,"FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCE Bangalore Good Environment, having fun, discipilne"
good,"Plenty of work to do all the time, very busy environment. Lots of training provided and there was always someone who could help with any problems or questions."
good,I was hired on a temporary basis and will be unable to provide an accurate summary of the working environment.  People were good however the culture did not seem appropriate for a long term career
good,"Best work place for freshers to make career. Transport facilities and food is available for all the employees. "
good,"Nice place to work!!! learning opportunities are really higher in the initial years, how ever after 4-5 years work tends to be a bit of repetitive"
good,"The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) mandates a document generally referred to as the HUD Settlement Statement, which requires multiple parties’ approval (e.g. the lender and the other party’s attorney) before a closing can take place. For the purpose of easier disclosure and compliance, information must be entered in a specific HUD Settlement Statement format and style."
good,"As a Fresher, i understood the BPO Culture from this organization"
good,Best place I have been employed for and the culture is diverse. There are many opportunities to grow in your career if you desire to move up. Great benefits are offered including stock options and health insurance.
good,"A TYPICAL DAY HERE WAS NOTHING BUT work, it was no playing around when you walked into that building. management was hardly there and you really were on your own. the hardest part of this job is knowing how to balance talking on the phone to different type of customers and making sure that you are handling their problems correctly. the best part about the job was lunch break or clocking out and the benefits they offered."
good,There is no scope to learn anything new at Fidelity but if you really want to stick to development and a relaxed environment then this firm would be a good opt.
good,"A good place to work with good hours and benefits. It is easy work, but it is a good place to get office experience and call center experience."
good,"A typical day at work consists of processing insured policies already signed and ready to be filed. At this company, I learned the values and ethics of a job environment as my management was very focused on developing these characteristics. The overall department was nicely professional especially when respecting others at times such as the end of each month. That was usually the hardest part of the job, completing the load of work our clients sent our way. The deadline had to be respected and so overtime was offered and used to finish on time. And at the end, it was all worth it because the beginning of the next month always started really slow which I thing is the most enjoyable part for everyone. Knowing that everything went smoothly and that the department was able to file the paper work on time."
good,"Answered phones, was tech support for the website software, customer service. Great boss!"
good,"With a long history deeply rooted in the financial services sector, FIS serves more than 14,000 institutions in over 100 countries.

I work in O2 Transfer of Ownership Team, wherein if any O2 Consumer or business account holder wants to transfer their account from consumer or business account to New or Existing Business account so they can send us the transfer of ownership form i.e. (TOO) form."
good,"Answering calls and replying to emails."
good,"Starting in a position that was previously void, the training received was unorganized and didn't really prepare you to complete all of the assigned dutiesl  "
good,This was a temporary assignment but a great company to work for. There were no positions available to apply for when my term was up. The environment was comfortable and staff was always very helpful.
good,"its good to work here, get opportunity learn a technical skills."
good,Was there 2 years it's OK if you can work.  12 hours shifts and the managers are OK. That's your life until you can build up some time work. The 401K is below avg.
good,good working with this company enjoyed and with new things learnt the system and actually wanted my other activity to be known that i love typing also which i wanted to work with some backoffice process and i got it in a bpo enjoyed

good,"Monitor agents to identify errors, deviations & initiate corrective measures"
good,Working with FIS was very challenging indeed but that was the beauty of the job. Trying to understand and pinpoint the location of fraudulent activity on a daily basis was a very intriguing part of the entire shift for myself.
good,Good place to gain experience in Banking Domain Industry. Good Exposure to the various technologies if a person is involved in the application support area.
good,Larger Co... Finally Merged with TCS...
good,"Good opportunity to use multi-task skills, improved my Excel skills, ability to work from home, and learned and utilized several different databases ."
good,Great company to work for and great pay. I have recommended and will continue recommenfing that others take a shot at working with a fortune 500 company. It's hectic and work is given to you according to your skills although your pay mat be the same as another doing less work.
good,"Uma empresa boa porem, não tem muitas oportunidades de crescimento!"
good,I was a consultant in the company and only work here for a few month. It was result oriented place for a consultant. Collaborators from the IT department were very supportive and it was a pleasure to work there.
good,Good experience working with Fidelity National Financial.  Good benefits and training opportunities available. Many opportunities for advancement and growth.
good,"Fidelity is a fun place to work. The office environment and culture are great. The work life balance cannot be beat. However, opportunities for advancement are limited."
good,"Working for FNIS was a very challenging experience because of the wide array of clients we covered for technical support. Our primary customers were banks and credit unions with varying technical backend systems. This required us to maintain knowledge of many different technical systems in order to provide timely support. It could be stressful at times, but the people in the call-center were always nice. I'd gladly still be working there but the call-center operations here in Jacksonville were closed and relocated to a different part of the country after a merger."
good,"Does not balance concern for employees with advancement of the company. The company feels it's goals are first and the employee should be honored that they were hired by the company, They do not recognize the importance of employee retention and feel that anyone can be replaced. This attitude is not a good morale booster."
good,"nice place to work"
good,"Large volume of people on the same floor, good moral for the most part. Management seems a little out of touch. The hardest part of the job was working behind an anonymous email address for employees nationwide."
good,A comfortable environment and pressure free. Lots of technologies being used and good exposure to US code banking. Used old software testing methods though like waterfall model.
good,This is a good position to start off in a large company with a smaller company feel. The down side is most management does not have the sufficient to actual manage a team and jobs aren't based on merit but instead- who you know.
good,Experienced the opportunity to work on pending litigation and ongoing cases from all across the Real Estate spectrum. Representing  the Title Insurer required a wide range of information and an all-encompassing understanding of the issues & the ability to recognize the claims and arguments of all the parties to the litigation.
good,"fun work plae with supporttiive management "
good,It was a wonderful experience with FIS. I have worked with best team of FIS. It was a great learning experience for me professionally as well as personally.

good,"A 3 and 4 day week is great, time goes by so fast when your busy.  I learned a lot from all my fellow co-workers and management teams. For me the hardest part of the job is having to work the Holidays.  The best is when you only work 3 days and get to spend 4 days with your family without using any vacations, PRICELESS."
good,"Nice friendly work location, learnt he corporate ethics, and i got a good platform"

good,"In a typical day, we would assign orders and complete prelims for our costumers. I worked in the Socal Refi department and I learned a lot about the mortgage business and all the codes needed for California Refi Prelims and how to be a productive and accurate Title Examiner. The Management was awesome!! Great Staff and laid-back atmosphere. The most difficult part of the job was making sure to be as thorough as possible while maintaining due out times. The most enjoyable part of the job was being faced with new challenges everyday and being supported by a great team/staff."
good,"I feel like this company undervalues the dedication and loyalty of the employees. I met people everyday willing to do anything for the company, but each department is hidden from the other; so you can't support each other in the whole mortgage process. An open forum would really bring lots of management problems to surface."
good,"Entrei na empresa como Operador de Telesserviço, e após alguns meses pude prestar recrutamento interno e subi de cargo, para Analista Operacional. O ambiente e calmo e tranquilo, tanto a gerencia como meus colegas de trabalho sempre estavam dispostos a ajudar e a serem ajudados, trabalhávamos em equipe."

good,"I enjoyed my tenure with this company, and am grateful for the experience and the great people I worked with."
good,This job is great for someone looking for an entry level position great potential to move within the company
good,A nice concept for professionals working for professionals to restructuring the standard of cooperative banking experience. Gathering place for communities top professionals
good,Generally a fair place to work. It is a large organization that goes through fits of growth and purging. So you might be working on expanding 5 data centers one day and closing 4 of them the next.
good,Good work culture. Job security. Working from last six years. In accounts payable. FNFI is a title insurance company. Growth is nt up to the mark. Good ambiance
good,Over all its a nice a company to get explored to different technologies. Working with multiple domains and firewalls is a nice challenge. Work culture is excellence and fantastic coordination  among the people.
good,"The good times are always right around the next corner."
good,Good company to start up and life balance is ok where we will be getting weekend working and they will pay for extra work done and good to start up as a fresher.........
good,"Work life balance is great."
good,Working in this position required me to be prepared to handle a bombardment of tasks throughout a very long day. Excellent multi-tasking was key to survival in such a busy environment.
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, muito estável porém nível de tecnologia baixíssimo."
good,"You work hard but get paid well. I learned more on the job then you can learn in a classroom. If you work hard you will be acknowledged and promoted.  I learned all of my technology skill sets on the job.  Within the 10 years I worked with FNF, my jobs were software trainer, customer service, project management, business analyst, quality assurance, Manager of a Technical Department, selling REALEC that was the only product in the Country at that time."
good,"Very fast pace "
good,"I have been worked more than 2years with FNFI, it was good  experience, I have learned so many thing from my senior related to our process and apart from that also. which was really good. Management is good  and some where need to change some thing."
good,Aprendi muitas coisas sobre relacionamento interpessoal.
good,"Basic call center job. Lots of hours, mandatory hours if your department requires it. Training is unorganized but that could be a temporary thing. The only stressful part is the mandatory hours that can occur, and that's depending on your department that you work in. This company has lots of different departments and you are given the opportunity to move to other areas in the call center. The pay can be satisfactory, with benefits included."
good,"Good company to work with"
good,"these were my duties:"

I have trained and encouraged the Processors in my area and lead with a positive environment. There is no hard part of my job and I enjoy what I could do. In terms of the management, it is unusually different."
good,I would respond to the help desk tickets assigned to me and close in a timely manor. The people were friendly  and working conditions were good. I was able to learn several different operating systems. It was a large company with many end users so you were able to keep busy all day

Hardest part is when we have lots of volumes and have to clear the back log then leave for home. enjoyable part is the working environment is very cool."
good,"Great company culture, excellent benefits. Tuition reimbursement."
good,I work with great people but there isn't much room for growth in my current position. The benefits are generous. Free lunch on Tuesdays. Overall not a bad company

good,"I was doing Mainframe work and then had the opportunity to pick up skills in asp, JSP, Java, and Java back end. I used JDBC to interface with SQL server stored procedures."
good,"The organization has many opportunities and can be a great place to work if you are working for a manager or director who is willing to listen to his or her subordinates.  There can be a lot of stress due to deadlines which are not set realistically.  Changes in corporate structure can leave you out in the cold.  Be very careful, there are some very toxic managers there."

good,"Day to day was good, probably too many meetings(like 1-3 a day). The real killer was the waterfall workflow, there would be nothing for a few days then all the work would fall on the remaining days in the week. "
good,"I provided financial advice for investors.  Cohig and Assoc. offered, at times, very successful companies for a Public Offering.  Some companies included Frontier Air, Koloa Baby Care, Boston Chicken (now Boston Market)."

good,"A typical day at work would start at 6:30 am and end at 2:30 pm. The job never stopped there.  Was on call 24 hours 365 days a year. I learned to be patience and understanding of issues I had no control over. . Most of the managers had been there over 25-30 years. The hardest part of the job was the over night calls. At times they seemed endless. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pride I took in doing a great job. The people were all very nice and really got along. "
good,I loved working in this company. Leaned the Core banking products and the functionality and gained experience working with the big bank clients and deliverables.
good,"Enjoyed working at FNF.  Great people and fortunate enough to have the best of managers.  Sadly, the employees within the company, regardless of their contribution, are viewed as simply a number in the headcount and are thus considered expendable.  Over the past 2 years, FNF's corporate headquarters has allowed or in some cases urged some of their best resources and great employees to be released from employment.  Their loss will most likely be another's (and probably the competition's) gain."
good,"Work remotely most of the time, required to be onsite support once a while is flexible to balance work and life. Learn new stuff everyday, management is fair and square, workplace is fun, the hardest part of the job is schedule vacation ahead, the most enjoyable part of the job is learn new stuff everyday."
good,"New to Industry & started new corporate life in Fidelity, which gives me more respect in society, which pays me good salary, which motivates my strengths"
good,"Rewarding but quick paced. Multitasking required to keep schedules on track. liked that I was constantly busy, but when things got interrupted it got hectic."
good,I considered Fidelity an awarding environment.  The company promoted from within and encouraging to continue education.  FIS promoted from within first before considering outside candidate.  The company did an evaluation of telecommuters and all employee's within 100 miles had to being going into the office.  This occurred approximately the same time fuel increased to over $4.00/gal.
good,Great place to work. I work in a family oriented department. Managers really care about their employees. Time off is always available when needed. The team works well together.
good,Fidelity National Financial India is an MNC wherein the growth is in a high rate. It is very good for freshers to start up their career and learn the work culture in an MNC.
good,"good to work with friendly co-workers, overall working environment is pleasant and too comfortable, able to learn and implement our skills."

good,I am working in Fidelity Information Services (FIS) as Process Analyst taking care of American Express credit card disputes.
good,"A typical day at Fidelity would include working on audit requests, variance reports, documentation for balance sheet accounts, working with the field to create and post journal entries. The managers that I worked under there were very helpful and would assist me willingly at any point when I was not sure how to complete something. Even though this was a temporary assignment I learned about the ins and outs of how the accounting works for a large corporate company. The hardest part of the job was having no formal training since I was a contract employee. This required me to learn quickly and adapt to all the things I was expected to do."
good,I really enjoyed this job and if it were not for the layoff due to the real estate decline I would probably still be there! Great management! Lots of employee engagement.
good,"I learned fast typing on computer, finding data on different screens ."
good,"The company is good in learning theory of the work."

good,"Fidelity National Financial is overall a great employer.  The benefits package is excellent.  Management provides regular employee morale incentives and boosters.  Management is fair and understanding.  FNF-LoanCare services over a million mortgage loans nationally with 6 locations in the United States.  The Document Control department however was understaffed , consisting of 6-8 personnel on the non lien release side, which supports all company departments for all locations nationally to obtain necessary documents for departments such as Foreclosure, Bankruptcy, Property Preservation, and Customer Service to name a few.  Therefore, in this department, task numbers are very high due to being understaffed.  A typical work day is very productive and also timelines are tight. Paygrade was unfortunately mostly equal for all team members in the Document Control Department.  I personally had very high completed task numbers, opposed to most of my co-workers who's pay grade was equal to mine.  Additionally, FNF-LoanCare is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which is a very high commute from my residence in Newport News, VA."
