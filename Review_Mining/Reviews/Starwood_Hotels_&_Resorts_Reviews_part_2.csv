good,"The restaurant is busy most of the time and i had a great opportunity to work as the night chef, which allowed me to try new menu, to learn myself and also to try new things apart from what was on the menu. The Executive Chef  was very supportive and gave me freedom to try out new things with food and backed me up to follow my heart, when my day was not as good. The staff who worked along with me always supported and helped me through difficult times. Sometimes, i work alone in the night shifts which made be to become good at what i did, but until i became who i was i had to learn things in a hard way, still those things made me who i am now. The hardest part of the job was to work alone in the night shift. The most enjoyable part is cooking."

good,maior desafio diário seria atingir as satisfação de clientes de alto nível de importância e expectativas. desafio esse concretizado na maior parte das vezes com uma equipa bastante profissional e qualificada. a cultura empresarial desta empresa é bastante rígida visto ser uma empresa multinacional de luxo e que trabalha com pessoas de todo o mundo de forma a corresponder às barreiras linguísticas de alguns clientes internacionais.
good,"Not sure about other Westins, but in Sacramento I found this to be a great place to work. My supervisors were top notch as well as our GM. Their employee appreciation events were the highest I had ever seen. You had a lot of responsibilities at a quick pace. But I was always given the tools I needed to get the job done. The only bad thing about working there was the corporate office. Their dry to the book way in dealing with situations we very unfair and addressed more like robots instead of human beings. If possible I work with the Sacramento Westin team in a heart beat."
good,"This was a very good place to work at. They had three restaurants there,(remember this was in the late 1990's so things may have changed). They taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Burger King and then their own commissary.  I was in a managerial position with all three restaurants and helped out when needed in cooking, or serving or whereever I was needed, as well as making sure the employees were satisfied as well as the higher management levels. I loved working with the students and faculty, and I even met some well known people there as well. I liked it, but I went back to Long John Silver's as an assistant manager is why I left. (more money).Management was great, and the hardest part of the job was trying to come up with suggestions to improve the student experiences there. I really loved working with the students and the other employees."

good,Marriott is a great company to work for but not Urgo franchises. They don't value your work and ethics. Marriott offers great benefits and incentives for hard work.

Most enjoyable part is meeting new people and developing direct reports."
good,I loved this job but disliked my managers because they were very unprofessional. I loveddd my work place and co workers they always treated me good. Food was excellent because it came straight from the left overs from multiple restaurants in the resort. Tips where great.

I'm not bitter I feel the change of employment to Rite of Passage gave me a better outlook on life."

I usually work late nights which made it hard for me to have time for social life and family which ultimately lead to my decision to look for something else. most enjoyable part of the job were the people i worked with and the enjoyment of making our guests feel like they were at a home away from home. I love making people happy, and i got an opportunity to do that at Marriott on a daily basis."

good,"We get scored on from how guest feel about the overall hotel. My main focus was the front desk scores. The front desk scores were up and down at times because the hotel is in grave need of renovation. When the guest get an emailed survey,  they mainly have negative remarks about the upkeep and decorum of the hotel.They also complain about the noise for there's two nightclubs that are across the street from the hotel.They also complain about the quality  of the breakfast. These are the things that would bring a front desk agent score front a front desk checking at 10 to a 7 or 8 when the guest are negative about other parts of the hotel, that's the hardest thing about the job as a Front Desk Supervisor, for its not the fault of the front desk agent. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is greeting the guest as they enter the hotel doors and seeing their smiles and they enter and looking forward to a nice time in new Orleans, La. I was not trained well when I was first hired for I did not have any hotel experience. I was hired for my extensive background in management, but I was they never let me use those skills. What I learned was you can't expect excellence if you're taught or trained in that field. The coworkers were somewhat friendly, some of them were very professional and some jut came in for the paycheck."

The most enjoyable part of my day was cooking and taking care of our guests, tasting different types of cuisines, and working with my co-workers."
good,"Ik had zoveel geleerd in Westin en het was zo gezellig met mijn collega's en de touristen die kwamen. We hadden goeie relatie met onze managers en supervisors en natuurlijk met de human resources en directuer van het hotel. Het was heel gezellig om iedere dag te gaan werken en wanneer de tijd kwam om naar huis te gaan bleven we nog een paar minuten kletsen met elkaar op het parkeerplaats. Werken als operator is niet makkelijk maar je leerd zoveel want je leerd netjes te beantwoorden en conclusie zoeken voor hun problemen en klanten helpen blij maken. We moesten zorgen dat de housekeeping de kamers schoon en netjes achter laat, reserveren voor restaurant als ze aan jou vragen."
good,"Property is excellent place to get NYC experience without the hassle of being in the city. Management offers feedback when possible helping to improve where needed as well as offering ""best practices"" examples. Company prefers to hire and promote from within so good place to grow."
good,"In my department I typically work alone for majority of the day, which can be quite fun, but also a bit lonely. Putting together meeting rooms and interacting with clients is definitely my favorite part of the job, the hardest part is finding things to do on slow meeting weeks. I usually have to then find busy work or work for other departments. I've learned a lot about sales in my time with the events department and that alone has been the most informative aspect about the job. Management is fine, there's always an equal share of good and bad, but I really can't complain."
good,Feels great at work because of Team work and that is what i get here. Always learn a lot everyday with co-workers who are carrying bunch of experience in the industry...

good,"Answering calls to make a reservation for guests worldwide. I don't get a lot of interaction with my coworkers since I'm constantly on the phone, but I still love this job because I get to meet lots of interesting new people everyday regardless. I've learned a lot about patience, but this job is difficult because you don't get much of a break between calls. Management is a little bit unprofessional, but it seems to be a trend in call centers."

good,"I worked the night shift at the Marriott, which sounds like it would be easy-going, but it was not.  We had long checklist of things to do ensuring that everything done earlier in the day was done earlier, and we had to make sure everything would be properly set up for the next day."
good,It was a really good experience to grow in the hospitality culture. The work methodology was simple and caring for the guests. Employee empowerment was used in the correct way and would let you interact more with guests. Team expectations were high and the Bell desk team was more than willing to accomplish so  that made a great work environment to be in. The Bell desk Manager was very conscious of his team's needs and will try to put them on the same level as the hotels expectations so 99% of the time employees would be pleased with him.

I love that you can be trained in other departments and assist in all areas at some property, there is room for promotions if not at the property you at but you do have a choose of any hotel or resort. My co-workers call use the  rainbow correlation where  you can work with people with different back grounds and speak different language and I found myself learn a lot as if I was in school. I love my job so it was no presser I do not look at it be hard to me it is a challenge and that is how I learn.

good,"I served guests at the resort pool, delegated tasks, solved problems, developed a professional set of communication skills, and managed specific areas of the pool. I also served guests at weddings and various large company events, and received surveys for being polite and having great service etiquette. The management team was attentive and worked with their employees to maintain a productive work environment, and my co-workers were also attentive and productive. The most difficult aspect of this job was getting time off, but it was a summer job and I knew what to expect.

They focus each team's initiative on completing designed goals in each department so that we all achieve the vision for the company. Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. I'm a bartender so compensation can be pretty good in many respects. Benefits are also very good. Marriott focuses its vision on first taking care of its employees wich I think says a lot about the company.The most enjoyable part is just being able to interact with different people from so many different walks of life, and build a connection with them."
good,"I began in Le Meridien Mina Seyahi, Dubai as a fresher out of university, and it was a drastic learning curb. Theoretically we were prepared for the tasks at hand, but a practical base was important and the property provided with ample opportunities to establish my skills."

Management is supportive and helpful. Very diversified core of co-workers, all being very friendly and hard working. The hardest part of the job is ironically the best part of the job which is that there is always something happening and always something to learn which is challenging, exhausting and refreshing all at the same time."
good,"A typical day would consist of me checking people in and out of the hotel answering guests complaints and questions. I learned how to deal with angry guest while being curduious and making sure to always find a solution. My management group was good always gave time off when needed and always helped you with situations if needed. Co- works were extremly nice I still keep in contact with them over my school year. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part are the same, it was the interacting with the guest and dealing with complaints was the hardest part because sometimes it wasn't easy to keep the guest happy but the was the enjoyable was to find out what was wrong and fix it."

When you walk into the hotel you feel like you have stepped back in time to the original NY feeling. Located across the street from the famous Waldorf Astoria and just steps from New York's Grand Central Station."
good,I never had a specific role at this property. I took it upon myself to cross train in different departments. I started out in housekeeping and progressed to Guest Service Representative. I learned that hard work pays off. Management allowed me the opportunity to grow and learn. They were also very involved with their associates and the community. The hardest part of the job was there was not room for promotions within. I did love that we were paid weekly and the benefits were great. We did a lot of charity work and volunteering.

good,My typical day started with making sure I got organized for my shift.  Cleaning the main guest bathrooms for appearance. Having an employee group meeting every morning.  Head back to the laundry room and hoping to have first load started and one dry load of wash to fold and give to the housekeepers.  Management was strong in family values and having a safe and nice visit with us.  The hardest part of it was some days keeping up with the laundry.  The most enjoyable part was usually lunch hour and sometimes be treated to lunch.
good,"I was the Front Desk Manager at this hotel for approximately two years.  I loved working for the company, and only left because I was burnt out of the service career.  The benefits are great, definitely industry standard, and from a franchise company (Crestline) that says a lot.  The management staff were open to suggestions, and quick to recognize hard work.  On the flip side, the HR staff is quick to issue reprimands across the board, so make sure you know your employee handbook!  The best part about working here were the hotel discounts.  You have the option of all Starwood properties as well as all Crestline properties.  Sweet deal!  Also, the kitchen serves employee meals for $2 every day."

After that you run upstairs and get the housekeepers trash and bring it out to the dumpster. Then Wash up and time for your 30 minute lunch. After lunch you clean the break room and employee bathroom and fold pool and gym towels and bring them to the pool and gym. Following that you have to go upstairs and get the vacuum and vacuum all the floors in the hotel after finishing you get the last of the housekeeper trash and run it to the dumpster again. While doing all this you have to answer any radio calls and possible deliveries to guest rooms or housekeepers. Once a week when the supply truck comes in you have to check the order, sign and then put all the supplies away and restock the housekeepers closets on each floor. The Hardest part could be all the running around if you do not have good sneakers or shoes."

Carrying out treatments was the best part of the day for me, I love socialising and satisfying the clients and finding out more about their needs and wants from the treatment, providing after care information and recommending treatments to the clients which will benefit them. 10-15 minutes lunch usually somewhere between if I had time to fit it in or wasn't overbooked.Cleaning down, checking the health and safety check, hygiene checks and sterilising items required or used for the day. laundry and setting up for the next day. Working in part of a team was a big experience for me, working with other therapists from different age ranges and different experiences in treatments gain more insight and knowledge about other options. The hardest part of the job was to sell the business when we are overbooked with treatments and the manager is not organised when required to manage her team."

The management was not the best but, they made sure everybody's day was starting off good! My co-workers all had different ethics which was something that I liked. The most enjoyable part was recieving the cute little ""Thank You"" notes the guest leave for the housekeepers."

What I have learned at Marriott International was how to communicate with guest over the phone with the right attitude in order to help the customer until satisfied, or until the sale has been complete. Management at Marriott, are very outgoing and will do any everything in the best of their ability to make sure you succeed, and also as far as the work environment, it is a great environment, different areas to sit, which makes it a lot easier to ask questions if needed to do so. The hardest part of the job would definitely be your attitude, and the way you present yourself through the phone.

good,"Overall, Marriott is a generally good company to work for. They put effort into quality of work life, health and wellness and employee satisfaction. However, hospitality is a low paying field and Marriott doesn't pay the highest within that field. Pay tends to be too low for cost of living. The management teams can be good but can also be terrible. It really depends on the property. In one property, you can find an extremely wide variety of personalities, motivations and quality of leaders. "
good,"Working with the hospitality industry, helps you to adjust to various individuals and their personalities. It rounds you off to learn new languages and cultures. I truly enjoyed working with the Marriott Company.

I don't think iv'e ever earned so much experience in any food chain/establishment. through serving in the hotel i learned how to prep food, bar tend, great customer service, prepping coffee, stocking beverages, extreme cleanliness and amazing customer servicing. the hardest part of the job would probably be when it would be too busy, to where i couldn't take orders while i was taking orders and serving as the sole bistro server, my favorite part of the job would have to be the people/buisness men that id see from places around the world. such amazing leadership and sense of security."

good,such a good experience here since i never knew how wild and hard it would be to please guest staying at a hotel. let alone pleasing people over the phone and accommodating their needs for their stay.
good,I was not prepared for the on call system which was extremely unconvince. I would have stayed they if there was more guidance on how to manage two jobs with the system they had. It was as though they expected me to be ok with sitting around and waiting for someone to book a massage without paying me for the time wasted. I would definitely give it another shot. It would be simpliar now that I've acquired more life experience.

I was given the team I needed to succeed. Management was shaky at first, but towards the end of my working there, the management was great.

The flexibility of the schedule was the best thing when you are a student and still want to own some pocket money yourself. Besides, other waiting staff were also my age range young people, enthusiastic, organized and well prepared, so it made easier to adapt to the environment at first. Managers where absolutely nice, always ready to help when needed, or to answer any questions any time. What I really learnt during my practice there was to organize my time, to get skills of working in a team and also be aware of situations when I had to take actions instantly to solve the situation.

good,I learned a lot about almost the culture of the world. You always have something to learn. It is a place of great diversity; department after department. 
good,"I began at Marriott while attending college and working in the bar/restaurant to pay for school. Once I graduated I decided to stay and  climb the corporate ladder as I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the people I worked for. The training taught me how to handle people in a customer service industry and how to effectively take care of their needs. "
good,relajado.                                                                                             mucho porque cogí experiensia laboral                                                  excelente                                                                                                       excelentes buenos compañeros                                                                     ninguno                                                                                            todo lo que aprendi mientras que  laboraba
good,"very good staff "
good,"Job specifications  and requirements where always made clear. "
good,"A typical day at the Marriott: I take reservations either in person or on the phone, check people in/out, handle financial situations via computer system, edit any discrepancies in reservations, direct guests around Keene for entertainment, and clean around the lobby area."
good,"Mise en place, inventory check, acknowledging the guests and educating them about the menu. Order taking, up selling, communication with the team and the management. Recommendations to the management for increasing sales. The hardest part is not making money because of lack of business and the enjoyable part is taking care of a party of 30 on my own."
good,Learned a lot and overall great experience. Job is great as far as offering better opportunities and giving you options to move up.
good,"My day would start with signing in preparing the buffet for guests, conference rooms for companies, all round cleaning and resetting the buffet and conference rooms. The fun part was working with my co-workers and meeting new people. I enjoyed my work there at the Marriott."
good,"The day usually starts off with morning meeting, followed by giving the room attendants their assignments for the day. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers and I think that they really enjoyed working with me"
good,Everyday we set up events for high profile events. I learned the value of customer service as well as working under tight deadlines. The hardest part of the job is moving an immense amount of furniture around a large hotel. The most enjoyable is to see the finished room you set up and seeing people enjoy what you created.
good,"Work was always pleasant and fun and I learned new styles of cuisine while at the W. My manager was intense, and pushed his workers as far as we could be pushed, and at the end would compliment us for our hard work. All my fellow coworkers were always entertaining and encouraged me to try new things and experiment with new ideas when work would get slow. The hardest part of the job would have to be days where we would have large parties and banquet would get intense and hectic, but the rush and pressure were just as exhilarating and rewarding knowing I accomplished what seemed impossible at the time. Everything about the job to me personally was enjoyable because I love being and working in a kitchen."
good,Customer Service Representative
good,"i am long hours hard worker , believe in in myself and i born leader"
good,"Supervise crew of up to 12 laundry attendants in a refurbished plant with newer washing machines and newer flat iron machine. Learned how Laundry Science improved since the 1970s & 80s when I was in the military. My coworkers were Union so there was a ""wall"" between us as I was considered part of ""management"". The most difficult part of the job was until the upgrade most of the machinery was aged and had a propensity for needing continuous maintenance by Engineering. The most enjoyable part of the job was the way the team was treated fairly and management showed their appreciation for those who were focused on doing their jobs."
good,Great place to work fun and very interesting to interact with the different diversity of people that i came across. Every day was a new day @ work a new experience by the second.
good,Es una excelente empresa estructurada para crecer y aprender
good,Making reservations for guests in a pleasant environment. Very productive and happy place to work. That cares about your health by having health fairs that help you with heathy eating and excersize. Mangers to help you improve and are easy to work with. friendly co -workers that are always willing to help. The hardest part about the job is when guest are upset about thier stay and take it out on the first person to answer the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a guest is excited about an upcoming vacation and making the reservation for them makes you feel happy and excited for them.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Marriott franchise at both the Residence Inn and Fairfield Inn. We were like a family, we had one goal; to provide high quality customer service. At times it would be a hostile environment when work not completed by one co-worker affected anothers work production. Management was really great to work and provided the flexibility needed to maintain the family life outside of work. The Marriott is a great place to work for but, if you do not hold a salaried, management position, the pay rate is not great enough to live off of."
good,Whilst working at the Leicester Marriott Hotel I have learnt and endless list of new skills.
good,nice place to work .i enjoyed working there .the management is very skilled .my co-workers are very coprative.
good,"Since my first day with Marriott, I have loved my time with the company. It can sometimes be a challenge to figure how to please each and every guest, but after the first few you begin to realize each is a puzzle just begging to be solved. That said, once a relationship is fostered with a given guest, a new world of information is opened up, as guests are very often willing to talk at length with you. As a company, Marriott is also very supportive of its employees, with a generous benefits package and very fair wages. If you have the opportunity to spend a couple years with Marriott, I highly encourage doing so!"
good,"very good company to work for, great training and benefits. Good management. If you like the hospitality business i would recomend the Westin ."
good,work is hard at times but the co-workers make it go smooth and they make time go by fast.
good,"At Marriott, I would book customer's reservations for hotels all over the world. It was amazing to learn about places that I never knew existed! I learned a lot about time management due to the call center environment, and that I played a part in someone's dream vacation! The management had a great open-door policy, and was also very helpful in constructive critisim. I didn't have a lot of contact with my co-workers after the training classes were over, but while I got to know and talk to them, they were all so nice and welcoming. The hardest part of my job was being on the phone for up to 10 hours straight. I enjoy talking to people and helping them the best way I can, but I'm not a phone-only kind of person. I love face to face contact! The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people find the best hotel for their needs, and make sure it has the ammenties they required. I remember one instance specifically, and I wasn't even booking a reservation on this call. A woman had called in, was lost and not able to find her hotel. I pulled it up on the computer, enlarged the map and stayed on the phone with her for 45 minutes until I got her safely to her hotel. This has just stuck with me, and I'm happy that I was able to help her in anyway I could."
good,"A typical day would either consist of working the check-in desk, or in the back answering the switchboard. I learned a great deal about how the world of hospitality works. I always had a 40 hour work week, and the benefit package is great."
good,A typical day at Starwood would involve me sitting down and taking calls all day. Most days it wouldn't be that eventful but sometimes you would get the occasional caller who complimented you on your voice or your customer service skills (I got a lot of both of these) and then you would get the customer who is just calling to get something they are not entitled to. Then there are the angry customers who can't be calmed because they refuse to see reason and then there the random prank calls that don't happen too often but their still pretty funny.
good,I enjoyed working with my colleagues and the training and experince Ireceived from them.
good,"The greateset is being able to meet all types of people with different personalities. The job consists of my supervising several employees, on the up keep of the hotel cleaness. Satisfiing the customer so it could be a return guest."
good,"Dependable people. The people there are helpful, and resourceful. Human resources was a big help to me as far as my 401k plan and medical benefits."
good,very interesting group of people to work with.
good,Truly enjoyed working for this company but they are contracting my department out. Due to the new company not being part of Marriott I feel it is a good time for me to leave.
good,"la mejor empresa en la que he colaborado,,,, hasta hoy y esperando integrarne a alguna de sus marcas nuevamente"
good,"Excellent place to work, come to work, do your work, nice, friendly work family, be on time, miss little/no days and you’ll love this place, enjoy your new career"
good,"Working at the Marriott has been a great experience. I love my coworkers and I feel like a part of the family. The only pitfall is that there is a 20% service charge that I do not receive, and you don't get to take your tips home at the end of each shift. On the other hand if you work your way up to full time the company offers benefits, and you get a 50% discount on rooms."
good,great workplace environment and opportunity for growth. Benefits are great. Learned a lot from working in different departments. Ability to move to different areas with ease.
good,"Working at the Marriott International hotel was amazing. The staff was incredible and the overall work environment was amazing. Everyone was always having a good time. Absolutely would recommend either staying for a night just to see the rooms and the service, or attempting to work there!"
good,"Meeting new people from different states and Countries ..Management worked with you most times showing you proper care for customers. "
good,Great people to work for lots of training got done friendly people to work with and for good pay and I miss being part of them also like making our guest very happy and keeping the building up to standard s
good,"My coworkers have all be friendly and easy to work with. Management has always shown concern and recognition when necessary. Guest interactions and local events make everyday feel different. Working in hospitality, especially as a shuttle driver has given me the opportunity to meet and interact with people I otherwise wouldn't have. The level of exposure to people from all walks of life has made me more social and confident in who I am and what I can provide for others. I've definitely had a very positive experience working for Marriott."
good,"It is a fast pace environment, that can be stressful if unprepared. You will be working with others usually in a team, so be ready to rely on others to have your back."
good,I love working for marriott brand they treat all employees like family.I learned that the people you make feel comfortable love to come back because of the warm family welcome they recognize about Marriott. I love being apart of a Brand that symbolizes so much .
good,Great company to work for if you really want to work in the hospitality industry because advancement is possible from an early start. The benefits are great and the team members I worked for are amazing.
good,"Excellent communication with different cultures, "
good,"Answering phone with a smile! Handling guests needs from beginning to end.  From reservations, rewards department, as well as customer complaints.  Marriott is always changing to keep up with the times meant lots of training.  I started working at the call center and graduated to working from home.  I loved working with a variety of people on the phone."
good,I've worked a few locations in different states and I can honestly say that it feels like you're working with family. Everyone is always pleasant and the managers are supportive in career development.
good,"i learned that work is necessary to provide my family support, this specific hotel have very fond customer service and it is great to work there but no raise ever"
good,"Marriott is a great place to work just on certain things you have to demand for what you want although, it’s a nice atmosphere with culture and nice people."
good,"Spent a solid three years at the Westin Ottawa, and loved my work family there. Great culture of employee and community engagement and many opportunities for growth and advancement."
good,"I enjoyed learning from management and working alongside my team. We had excellent team environment and I would recommend working for Marriott. I may again work for them in the future however I would like to make more than $30,000-$50,000 in one year and it may be difficult to find a job at Marriott for my goals."
good,I quite enjoyed working with Marriott hotels because they provided us with full training as well as it gave me the flexibility to work for more than one branch in same time.
good,This was the first job I had after graduating college. This is the place that I started my career path and I don't think I was quite ready. The environment was conducive to learning the necessary skills I needed to build a career in this industry. The people I worked with taught me a lot and how conduct yourself in a professional manner. I thank the people I worked with all my heart for teaching me to be a professional. School can only teach you so much and this place I learned a lot about being a professional
good,"Hotels are hotels, it is what you make of them. Met some of the greatest guests on the planet but also some of the worst. Coworkers are great and the upper management were very pleasant. Sales team was a bit removed from the front lines and occasionally lost sight of the impact on associates when they promise more then can be delivered."
good,I am currently employed and I enjoy working for the company. I feel as if this role is perfect for college students and students who are truly interested in climbing the ladder within hospitality. The pay is average for the ro0le and location and the work-life balance is great if you like flexibl;e schedules.
good,I am happy to be part of one of the international hotel chains in the world.  I have worked seven years and I have learned a lot in this property. Take a chance to have more developmental training.
good,The company puts its' best foot forward and really takes care of it's employees. My favorite thing about working with the company ( specifically the Gaylord Texan) is that they make sure you are taken care of and proactively makes sure that your needs are met.
good,My review on the job was very good because not only did the Marriott  know how to treat customers to their best ability but they also knew how to work as a team.I have learned that giving any kind of work environment you must know how to balance when the time comes for you to be very attentive to the customers and their needs as well as making sure that your job and task are being met each day. This may have been the hardest part of the job however knowing the work culture and environment I can say that I have truly enjoyed my time and serves with Marriott .
good,checking in and out customers making sure they get the best possible service. Service and Marriott motto's are strongly enforced. Whole hotel constantly audited
good,"When Marriott took over, a lot of unnecessary changes happened that overly stressed out the employees. The Westin stopped doing things that showed appreciation for the employees, that in turn, pushed absenteeism, lack of morale, and other deviant behaviors."
good,It is a good place to work in I really love working for Marriott I love thier activities what they do for us in housekeeping people are really fun to work with I love that we work in teams
good,Marriott was a good place to work. Benefits were good.Good team work. interaction between front of house and back of house made this a good location to work.
good,Working environment is very good ... getting knowledge from the great chefs..it's a brand where we have a chance to explore and develop our working style and skills.
good,"At the Laguna Cliffs Marriott I had an exceptional work experience. My time there taught me many life lessons about work and life outside of work. I became more responsible, reliable, and more of a leader. A typical day of work entailed setting up for the banquet, serving the guests food, tending to the guests need, and bussing tables. The management was very supportive of the employees, always motivating us to be better people and better employees. The work place was a very fun place to work and all of the employees had a very close, friendly relationship. The employees were also the most enjoyable part of the job. The employees created an environment where everyone was there for each other and everyone would help each other out when they needed it."
good,"keep me busy and learning every day is a wonderful thing, I love to surround myself with intelligent people and I like to show how I work every day, my current job gives me what I need to keep growing,"
good,"Le Meridien Hotel was a good start for me here on Dubai, as it was a very busy industry and. you will learn a lot of things at the same time you will enjoy the work together with your colleagues."
good,"Starwood was a wonderful company. If Marriott continues the same culture, it to will be a great company to work for. Because of the large amount of properties, there is a tremendous opportunity for advancement."
good,Working There Was A Fun Experience and Never knew what it took to work there but I seen you had to put your blood sweat and tears to provide the best customer service and I did and was very dedicated and passion for this field

good,"I extremely enjoyed my time at the Sawgrass Marriott.  The people enjoy working there and it's a large family for the most part.  I would highly recommend to anyone to take the chance to work there.  The GM is highly motivated to knowing everyone on property and he is the face of the hotel.  Whether you're out in front of guests, or behind the scenes, he will learn to know who you are and appreciate what you do for the hotel."
good,Working customer service for 22 years 10 years has been in food and beverage enjoy every aspect of these positions .. I consider fodd and beverage to be fun and flexible ...

good,Muy buen ambiente laboral excelente lugar para trabajar
good,"Working with St. Regis Hotel feel proud for me. Big Brand."
good,I good place for me as a beginner. The bosses were flexible with my hours at work and school. Hardest part with getting used to the commitment but the culture (piers)  were helpful.
good,Starwood is good place to work place to work. they have a great training programs to allow workers to learn fast and get promotions easy. They also have great benefits.
good,Was understaffed towards the end of my time there. Would have loved to stay but the back to back calls the entire shift was becoming too stressful. Apparently they greatly miscalculated the call volume for that time of the year.
good,everyone is nice and gets along.its a fast moving job. its job where you like to wake up and go to work. the boss are nice and repectful. its good place to start a career.
good,Pleasant working environment. Good pay. Good benefits including all meals. My main problem was the scheduling and my inability to meet all the expectations.
good,"Banquets at LeMeridien it's a fun and enjoyable place to work mainly because of the Banquet Manager. He created a good team and, while extremely professional and customer focused, he allows us a certain degree of freedom to express our creativity."

good,"When going in to work at the Westin I was in for a different set of circumstances every day. I learned how to effectively communicate with guests, effectively troubleshoot, and work well both independently and as a team."
good,"Great company to work for just got bored making the same things every single day, but different styles of people bringing different flares. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the customers"
good,"Preparación de mise a place, preparación y organización de eventos, montaje de mesas y decoración en frutas, quesos, charcuterías, entremeces, etc. Manejo y temperaturas de neveras, montaje de plataje, etc."

good,"Your work was appreciated and your work leaders had vested interests in your success. Work-Life balance could be a challenge, given the company is a global entity."
good,A day at the Marriott is always an adventure. You meet an array of different people each day from all walks of life and cultures. It teaches you a lot about appreciating different things and people and how to interact with someone who may not be of the same mindset as you.
good,"I love Cypress Harbour. All of the staff feels like a family. The only issue I have is that it is very hard to move up. While working here I have really grown a lot. The management really takes the time to push and mold you into a great leader. if you set goals for yourself they will do their best to help you achieve those goals. This resort is one of the oldest vacation clubs in the area and it is very well kept, that being said we are number two in the company right now and we are working toward number one. I would say working outside in the Florida heat is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of this position would be making connections with the guest and creating memories that last a lifetime."
good,The company is easy to learn as well as progress but some of the interactions between actual hotels and the reservation center were not as clear or concise as needed.
good,Working with Sage Hospitality I have been able to advance my career. I have had so much support and encouragement and would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career in the hospitality industry.

good,"Good working culture, "
good,"Great company for advancement, and job security.  I have always been treated with respect and its felt like family.  Compensation is not as high as other hotels, though their benefits are hard to beat."
good,"White Plains Residence Inn by Marriott was a fun and productive pace to work, after new management took over they decided to brought in there own managers."
good,This was hands down once of the best employers I've had the pleasure of working for. Its a close knit family like environment and If I hadn't relocated I would return to their employed at my first opportunity.
good,Working for Marriott has been one of the best companies to ever be employed for.  Working as a Front Desk Agent and being promoted to Front Desk Manager has been one of the greatest accomplishments thus far.

good,"It is a very friendly and dependable company to work for.Greeting the staff while preparing to serve the Guest needs as soon and courtesy as possible, always remembering to think safety first"
good,management really tried to work with everyone. overall it was an amazing place to work. if it wasn't for so many complications I would have love to stay.
good,Great place to work but management needs to be better at following company standards. Very much appreciated the opportunity to work for the brand. Love the company values and what they stand for!
good,Marriott International is a great place to work. It builds each and every employee with confidence that creates a productive and well-balanced work environment.
good,Great Place to learn a trade at a high end restraunt. Constant guest chang out leading to need to be able to adjust to new cutures and situations at a moments notice
good,Starwood will allow you to reach for the stars if you want to!!! Call center has many requirements for you to uphold if you don't let that stress you out and request help when needed their standards are NOT outrageous. To move up in the company just take interest in that area let a sup know they are always happy to help. I am still sad they moved out of my area wish I moved with them as they had offered
good,"I met so many guest from all over the United States working for Marriott. "
good,Management always switches hands in one form or another. Working with many different departments and various types of guests in house for various reasons. Many different types of events in house almost everyday. Schedule will only vary in the days worked but hardly ever will you work a different shift. Tips and the satisfaction of making a guests stay more enjoyable are an everyday motivation.
good,"a typical day would involve preparing for the nights events, setting out the tables etc. then depending on your role for the night you could be on drinks reception pouring champagne or setting up the bar ready for when the guests enter. Once service has begun, you waiter to your given tables. it is an enjoyable job that i would recommend highly"

good,"I work at at hotel and I love it, I like it because I love with with people and getting to meet new people is an enjoyment for me. I like the aspect of management and all the responsibility that comes along with it. The hardest part of my job is making everyone happy, I can always try but not always succeed. The most enjoyable thing is seeing every one and being able to help the cancer patients that i come in contact with on a daily basis."
good,"All the duties has been do on time asap, the first is the guest. Our receive, we do at the moment."
good,"We  have a busy hotel. always different tasks in daily basis .dealing with customer and their needs during all these years, thought me skills that leads to gain satisfactions for both sides "" Guest & Employees "" "

good,It was fun and hard at the same time. The compensation was very good for the amount of work required. The people were all pleasant and the environment was great
good,"It has been a few years since I have worked here. I was with the Starwood Vacation Ownership Department in 2009 and it was an experience I wish I didn’t have to give up. A typical day was busy but there was always perks, managerial support and encouragement. I was amazed when they did quarterly functions they closed the call center. They truly care for all their employees and the managers are all great. The spirit of hospitality is definitely at Starwood."
good,"This Job was amazing from benefits to staff working with me."
good,"Working for Starwood taught me a lot with programs and computers, and to exceed with Customers. The working environment was laid back and had multiple opportunity to succeed. They taught me to work in a high level working environment."

good,I have a good three hours of hard labor a day and then  am able to relax as i have completed all the work.
good,This is a small property with a good team. Typically 2 employees per shift. Property is generally a business hotel and does get positive reviews as to property and service.
good,"I started at the Westin Kierland through a temporary agency. I was about to get hired onto their team as a fulltime cook II employee, yet personal mishaps prevented me from staying in Arizona. However,  I worked all of the food service areas including the line at the Nellies café, prep cook for Nellies café, employee cafeteria, and with the garde manger kitchen. I enjoyed the atmosphere because it seemed as though the people that worked there came from all over the world, which really opened people up to cultural differences. The job was very physical demanding, but anyone that has a goal to be a cook should know that it's a labor intensive job. What I loved about the job was that no matter how hot I was, sore I was, burned I was, busy I was, and much more, I always loved going to work."
good,"Reputable brand and company culture"
good,"it was a 13-14 hours of shift, but still it was manageable because of the colleagues and work environment around me. the hardest part was sometimes the peak season but with the team work we used to achieve our target. the most enjoyable part was the joy at work. certain activities were arranged for the staff every week which used to keep them fresh and dedicated towards their work. daily work management was purchase and order requirements in the kitchen for all the functions handling guest requirements so that we can meet the customer's satisfaction level."
good,"strongly agree all policies.take care to each other, open door policy,very hospitable associate all the times."
good,all the other staff members will welcome you with open arms and if you are looking for a job at the end of a school year over summer break then look no further
good,"Typically the moment I get to work and clock in my GM would greet me. We would discus interesting things that have happened since my last day at work.  After this I would make my way to the Front Desk, the employee working the shift before me would have the cash drawer balanced and ready to be checked again.  A job at a hotel is a great thing to have.  You meet some awesome people and get to try to fix anything that you can to make them happy.  My favorite part was the regulars.  Every day I came to work I made sure to check for any and if I found that one of their preferences were not fulfilled I would do my best to adjust it to make them happy but not too much and upset housekeeping.  A lot of times the hotel would oversell the rooms and we would fill up before I came to work.  One of the hardest things I had to do was to tell someone that I didn't have any rooms left for them even though they already booked their room online but we made sure that we had found a room for them already, at no cost to the guest."
good,"roster shift."
good,nice place to work. meet some nice people.management at the time was ok.my co-worker was nice
good,"A typical day as a Front Desk Manager I check the occupancy of the hotel. This helps me to see how close we are to the goal of selling every room in the hotel. I check the bed types of the rooms we have to see if I can upgrade any rewards members. Correcting  associates time is important, so their paychecks will be accurate. As a Front Desk Manager one of the most important things I've learned is communication. Communicating with the associates I manage, meeting their needs, as well as the needs of our guests and my managers. The most difficult part of my position is the instability of my schedule. If an associate can not make it to work and I can not find a replacement I go in. This usually is not a problem unless multiple employees call in for multiple shifts. The most enjoyable part of being a front desk manager is seeing an associate do something on their own or succeed in something I taught them. Another enjoyable part of my position is when a guest has a problem and I wow them beyond their expectations. It is a great feeling to bring someone joy and make a difference to another person."
good,Is a good chain of hotels where you work at home and very cordial and friendly atmosphere I left there was really a lack of knowledgeof all services
good,Cooked for and supervised for banquets as well as 2 additional restaurants

good,I know what to expect on every day basis as worker in Marriott.
good,"Standards were high, hours flew by and co-workers were always friendly and helpful. I gained a most of my experience waitressing from this job opportunity, and got to serve at some amazing events such as Indian weddings, career days and award ceremonies."
good,"8 am start prep list pick up items from cooler and freezer then dry storage, start cooking food the employees also prepping line together than once that's done, start prep for whole line. Hot items n cold items so restaurant has no problem with running out of anything for their shift. When people see the prep is being done mostly by one person then they don't want to help out and that's hard for one person. To see and hear how happy a guest were with their meal that pus a smile on my face."
good,"Enjoyable job meeting new people from all walks of life and getting to know others stories."
good,Learned Southern Cuisine and then gave it French influence. Managed 4 chefs. Special events - wine pairing.
good,You sign into your computer be ready to take calls at the start time of your shift. Be ready to finish up any open assignments you have to get done for members.

good,Good place to work...  Coworkers are great and try to help each other out... Great benefits and incentives.. And opportunity to move up... Have been here for 4 years...
good,"Marriott was pleasant company to work for.  Towards the end though, they kept adding additional job duties that was not worth the pay. I would go back if they paid at least $16 an hour."
good,"Personaly I really did enjoy my work period with the company, i think if I did continue with the company i would have learn so many things and build even strong career last but not least if i would choose a company to continue work for it would be Marriott."

The last day of my job there. My manager and team took me out to any resteraunt I wanted for lunch...there treat! I almost wanted to cry leaving.
good,Marriott is a great place to work. I just reached my first year working in this company and it seams like a month. The GM and supervisors are amazing people to work for.

good,"working in Banquet, it was long hours some time worked 16 hours, then come back after  7 hours rest and do it again.     it was a challenge,  but with upper management it was totally worth it."
good,"I""m naturally a night person so this job was perfect for me. The work isn't hard at all and I mostly worked alone so that was another plus. The pay could have been a little better but if the opportunity presented itself I would get back into that job field."
good,"Equipe dynamique et bon état esprit"
good,Get our day started I was a Housekeeping supervoir come.e in open house give the girls they keys an paperwork have a meeting for the day let them know what the project of the day was
good,I learned a lot worked under a lot of pressure which comes with the role of hospitality. The only con was being blamed for every issue from other departments and not  my department. You definitely build tough skin which is needed when working in the hotel industry and learn from your mistakes and makes you a better employee
good,Friendly environment to work. Very fast paced and fun place to work! Managers are very approachable and there when needed. Flexible hours and great place for growth. The restaurant is newly renovated along with the guest rooms which make the place look fresh and modern.

good,"A typical days work is open up the salon, check what is in the diary, set up the rooms if they need setting up, take the clients through todo the treatments, do call backs on the phone and book clients in"
good,The Ritz Carlton St Thomas is actually where loving hospitality came into play for me!! Started off as a server assistant and worked my way up!! I then decided to make a change in life which is how I ended up at the Marriott World Center in Orlando.. Working at the World Center was got a bit boring for me due to the fact that  I started as a hostess (not the job for me) At both Marriotts the coworkers were all like family.
good,On a typical work day I would ring out about 50-70 people up a day. Clean my area and help customers find things that they wanted to purchase. my co workers were also nice and would help me bagged up guest items if the store wasnt to busy.
good,"Great place to work, great company culture and a ton of opportunity to grow and develop as a manager. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to work in hospitality!!"

good,Working at the Marriott was very professional yet fun. Everyone got along with each other and there was never any disputes. I enjoyed working there for my work term.
good,"A typical day would consist of coming into work and having a short meet to gather information from the previous team members. Then i would head out on to the property to interact with the guest and patrol the property for safety. Working for this company I've learned how to be a more effective team player and how to brain storm ideas to help make the property more safety aware. The hardest part of this job I would have to say would be trying to please everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people, helping them with their problems and making their day just a little bit better."
good,Previously submitted in my job breakdown as I have worked for them for over 5 years now in a variety of roles.  I love the company.

good,"Great workplace. Meeting new people."
good,"Company doesnt pay their associates well at all , hours are terrible I would normally work all three shifts in one week and was constantly scheduled for turn around shifts , which is getting off at 11pm and returning to work at 7am, also seemed whenever I didnt cover my supervisors shift I would get written up for something very small or something I wasnt trained on, also once after getting off at 11pm my supervisor called me 4 times at 5:30 am to get me to cover her shift. The work load was not balanced evenly and the young persons are taken advantage of."
good,"                     October 2007- May  2009,Marriott International, Cincinnati, Ohio "
good,"Working here has been nothing but such a happy year for me i got to learn the core values of working with other ethnicities. Management is great, they care more for their employees then the guests...its always employees first then the guests, because if the employees are not happy then they won't be able to put on a good attitude towards the guests to make the guests feel welcomed."
good,When I first started the job it was fun but there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Management is definitely power tripping. Several belongings of mine were stolen from the management office and no one did anything about it
good,this job was a temp for the christmas holiday. located inside the a new mall that have just open up. I got to eat at different eater and do my shopping in a brand new stores.
good,"always willing to help in learning other departments. I learned a lot  I advanced in from pbx to reservations, then housekeeping, front desk.coworkers always willing to help.hardest part was when guest left valuable items behind. I was in charge of lost and found, so I had to locate them to get the items to them"
good,A typical day I set tables and brought food out when the customers sat down then after the event I would clear everything off and wash everything down. the hardest part was having a manager that wouldn't work with me. I loved the environment.
good,"Everyday at the Residence Inn is different. You can start off your day with many rooms to clean but only clean a few. Then there are days when you actually have to clean more than expected. From this experience I have learned that little becomes much and that you must humble yourself to do a job this demanding and actually stick with it. I have learned to appreciate other jobs that I have had and to appreciate others who perform the same job as me. I have learned that sometimes hardwork pays off in this industry, hence the occasional tips from guest. I think that management is doing the best that they can with their budget. They are thoughful enough to give us employee luncheons almost every month. My co- workers are very helpful when they want to be. Some more than others but that is ok with me. I do appreciate the extra help on a really busy day. The hardest part of this job is maintaining the mindset to actually do the job and to keep a smile on your face while doing it. I know it is not supposed to be glamorous but I wish that the guest would actually take into consideration that someone has to clean up behind them when they trash the room. Some rooms are easier to clean than others and it is frustrating sometimes, but you still have to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of this job is talking to the guest who have been staying long term or they have come back several times. You learn their names, what they like, how they like their rooms cleaned ect. When you hear someones story about how they lost their home or are there for work it becomes a personal experience"
good,My tyical day at work was fun hecked and enjoyable.My co-workers was mostly friendly.The hardest part of my job was having alot of rooms to do in one day the most enjoyable part of my job was going to lunch having a break
good,This was most of the time a enjoyable place to be. There were situations when i found that i need to support a students  who where being bullied. I really did not understand why people treat other so unkind.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at the Weston Hotel was meeting a very nice women Halley."
good,"fun,dealing with  people,learned hotel business. geat coworkers,clean up, l loved the job. 80%, great managers and great place to work 80%"
good,It was a great company it was very fast pace hotel generating maximum revenue the hotel was always under staffed  due to poor hiring and improper staffing.
good,Room cleaning and interactions with diverse atmosphere was nice. Maintenance involving cleaning of the rooms refreshing for the next guest. Decent job.
good,"Fun place and easy to work . Short hours low pay . "
good,"Greeting clients, scheduling appointments, file paperwork at the end of the day. Operate in house  computer system for processing payments. Made sure clients are feeling comfortable and welcomed"
good,"no benefits"
good,The Fairfield Inn by Marriott is a good place to work my co workers are nice and easy to get along with. But if your looking for a raise or benefits this is not the company to go for. They honestly need to work on some pay raises and benefits for the housekeepers at this company because housekeeping is the most important team in the hotel. We make a difference and without housekeeping they lose their customers.
good,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Banner (The Westin) Very hard working conditions, not much reward or recognition for accomplishments, pay is very low and the Ownership and GM are not real skilled in leadership and keeping good employees around."
good,"There are some management issues, love my co-works. hardest part is working with some of the management staff"
good,"Setup and break down of the restaurant in the mornings and evenings. Handling of money and customer satisfaction from open to close. "
good,This Marriott is an ok job to work for the pay should be more because of all you have to go threw and the managers need to be more direct and by the book.
good,A great place to work if you're a person who loves to travel. When there are big events in the city most employees are working so most of the time yourer at work. Not really a flexible work schedule either.
good,"The guests are the most amazing people, as it's an extended stay hotel there are some that become close family. The management tho does nothing to foster a positive work environment unless you are a favorite. They will make fun of you to your face and behind closed doors."
good,"im on contract i don't have much to say i work there but for a temp agency the staff is nice the chefs are sometimes nice always professional .. i would like"
good,I know all of the management from the GM down has changed since I have worked here. I left because I had just had my 3 child and needed a job with more flexibility.
good,springhill suites is a great place to relax also to work.It has great customer service from the front desk to the housekeepers.The breakfast is always full and delicious.All the desighs in the hotel is well done. springhill is just a home away from home.
good,Great job to work for 10/hr I enjoyed the job really a lot they don’t breath down your neck and you actually can work by yourself if you can get there work done
good,"Although I learned a lot there and the brand is excellent the manager"
good,"Mostly great colleagues, many changes since the merge. System glitches impede ability to perform the necessary tasks leaving many frustrated on a daily basis"
good,the company was ok but the team I worked with was the best. I couldn't be more sad to be leaving them but I have to do whats best for me thank you all
good,It was great place to work nice people and great atmosphere. We did have 3 front desk supervisors but other then that people lasted. Great location too. Always busy
good,Expérience enrichissante au niveau personnel et professionnel. Pratique d'une langue étrangère in situ avec les indigène de l'île britannique
good,Ok working place not very understanding when it comes to family emergency something like when you lose a parent  great customer that stays there nice place
good,"Easy job, check in guests, make reservations, and check out guests. The job is really simple the only thing that takes awhile to get used to is the system."
good,"I was hired full time under one position, they saw I worked better in another. I changed my availability from everyday to Monday- Friday and my hours went from 30-36 hrs a week to 8-12. Most people have been there for over a decade or more and are pretty set in their ways of doing things. Everyone thinks their opinion matters as if they are management and management does not correct them.  Overall if you like to go in do your job and go home, it is a great place to work, if you look for support and social people, not your best bet. HR is amazing, the only department that runs as it should."
good,"none stop hardwork "
good,"my job was to handle any pc or laptop issues re image,replace HD,upgrade RAM reset password"
good,"Good team work and I learn a lot of this like problem solving and be hoest in my team sharing ideas,learning differnet personalities of people around me,hard dest part of my job is to work in three possirtion and lack of people like 286 rooms we have 3 person only,I enjoyed to learn some things and knowledge and to know good friend in work."
good,• Greeting and registering guests with friendly and professional manner
good,Great Company! Friendly staff. Very professional. Nice place to work.
good,"Some of the people that you work for have attitudes  when the come to work and take it out on their workers. They want you to work hard and don't  pay you,forthe hard work that you do."
good,I liked the fact that they catered to my full time work schedule- since this was my second job they allowed me to chose my own schedule to work. I enjoyed my colleagues as well.
good,It would be great if they paid more considering we have to do so much. The job is very stressful because the guest don’t always make it easy. We have to work ten times harder for little to no respect.
good,"Management is weak."
good,the job was a good place to work but management needs to be revamped. The co workers stuck together and made the job a fun place to be. Unity among co workers. executive team was not great
good,Fun place to work but also a large company trying to get the little guy. If you're in a union you're goo! If you hourly make sure you get out by 430 so you can get to your night job. Low pay for hourly workers and sad 2% raise if you get a perfect score on your annual review.
good,good place to start your carrier. lots to learn and implement. HR plays a strong role and allows employees to express their views. top management is elitist and looks down on lower ranks
good,"Line cook prepping food such as hamburgers, salad, sandwiches and pizzas for indoor airport restaurant. Service line of customers with food and drink orders.  Cashiered sales of food and beverage items using MICROS system.  Traffic flow varied upon arrivals, departures and delayed flights."
good,Very difficult to comply with all the rules and regulations specially when you're not aware of them more training is needed for particular areas of training or not explained training may not be explicit Marriott rules and regulations are not very clear in English
good,"Es un hotel tranquilo. Mantuve mis conocimientos en el sistema Opera, aprendí las operaciones del Hotel, como lo es guiar a que tipo de restaurante acercarse, que lugar turístico visitar, etc. Mis colegas todos son alegres, aportan sus conocimientos a los nuevos y velan por su buen aprendizaje. No hay parte difícil que no pueda ser otorgado o aprobado con el fin de mantener al cliente o huésped feliz. Lo que me gusta es cuando un cliente se va satisfecho recordando a las personas que lo atendieron y que diga que regresa para vernos pronto."
good,Very nice place to grow up. My co workers are very nice people. I have a lot of friends here. I learn a lot from them. And I am happy that I am in Dubai.
good,Great job to learn from. Lots of turn over in the management it's because this company doesn't train managers very well. The company culture is very clickie. The property is very old and needs lots of attention.
good,"Learned a lot about hotel management."
good,Not a lot of benefits for the employees. Rarely anyone gets a raised. Extremely poor management. Poor communication. being hassled constantly.
good,"was great to work for!!! when we was hyatt, changed over to marriott in 2013 and was not by corp. marriott but one owner, no benifits, just a paper check every payday!!!! need something else soon."
good,"Very grate place to work, nice buffet spread ,, very rustic ,,non formal"
good,"11pm to 7am, Often I was the only employee at the 128 room Courtyard.  They had laid off the night houseperson and the night security guard and rolled those two jobs into mine."
good,"Marriott Corp, Is a great company however the management companies that run their hotels need some serious training on Marriott policies. On an every day basis the people I work with are very capable and enjoyable. The Experience is great."
good,to help clean rooms with housekeepers and to deliver items to guest whenever needed
good,"I need a job that offers benefits. Unfortanelty they do not offer benefits, or paid holidays."
good,I enjoyed working at the Marriott Hotel apart from that it was a 0 hours contract and they didn't have work all the time they had to split the hours between several staff some were  on different contract and they got the hours and others didn't.
good,"Great place to work, only to much left in the beds, would really hurt my back great people, management was great as well, some we're very helpful,if I wouldn't hurt much I would have stayed"
good,"The work is easy. The Executive Housekeeper is very unprofessional. The supervisors are ok, but they're very loud and ghetto. They never have enough linen to complete the rooms. The hotel is outdated and they expect you to scrub through mildew."
good,everything was fine. working with the first resort that exist on the island with tonne of employee that work in hospitality industries more than 30+ year experience always have an opportunity to learn something new'.
good,My overall experience working as a front desk agent was very beneficial and informative. I enjoyed working for them but felt like management could’ve been better.
good,It was a good place to stay  and relaxed you can do what ever you want  as your house and there were a really good guest in the residence inn by marriot
good,A typical day at work was always very busy. What I learned from this job was how to strengthen my customer service skills and how to effectively communicate with others better. The hardest part about the job was working with old and somewhat outdated equipment. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to connect with the guests at the hotel and being able to confidently supply answers to guests and ensure them that they will have a good time.
good,Great Managers tough regular employees but overall a good place to work just has a lot of turnover on top of customers who expect full service at a half service property
good,"A typical night at work includes handling a lot of requests from impaired guests, and disgruntled coworkers. Patience is very important here. The hardest part of the job is the work culture- everyone is unhappy."
good,It's was and good and easy job coworkers and supervisors where all nice it was just unpredictable days didn't work full hours when I expected  a 40 hours a week which was told to me
good,Marriott International is a good company.  Most all of the other associates worked good together.  All associates wanted to please the customer and performed their job to reflect this.
good,"Great people to work with, pay is a little stressed and family life is out of the question.  Management in the security department is the good ole boy mentality with puppets for supervisors."
good,"unorganized and not enough resources ; personnel to complete tasks that is required or demand.  Therefore, there was a lot of favoritism and too many shift managers but less productivity"
good,I hope they appreciate the hardwork of their housekeepers! I hope they stop gossips everything. Our human resources manager and assistant are great!!!!
good,learned new things and how the hotel works . training of basic things required being an associate. training managers helped the most to guide the proper path as a career .
good,Starwood company is good for me and I really appreciate it is a very very good company and my family and friends nice placer me and for me also grateful thanks
good,"i loved working for Marriott. the people that i worked with and the guests were all amazing. i learned so much such as taking and maintaining inventory, networking skills, and how to be flexible when put in other departments."
good,"Marriott as a whole in previous positions as been an excellent company to work for. I love Marriott. "
good,the perks and work/life balance has changed with my position switch as I am doing more of client building and outside-the-workplace activities. golf outings and luncheons.
good,Constantly busy. I enjoy a variety amount of work. Worked well with management and with co-workers as well. I was willing and able to learn new ways of making my work more productive.
good,"Overall very recognizable brand world wide , proud to have with this establishment and also brand."
good,"It was great working for Marriott International! A day at work was always challenging. Working with the public is never easy, but I enjoy it. You get to learn a lot from everyone you meet. And my co-workers we always worked as a team."
good,"My day starts out with reports. I run reports then I go through them checking for inconsistencies and problems, then fix them or pass them on if they are beyond my abilities. I then receive and create reservations, accept phone calls, run more reports, fax documents, provide services to guests, and perform multiple tasks set by the GM and other managers. I have learned a great deal about working with difficult people. I have learned to make enemies my friends and to ignore gossip. I had several co-workers that I loved to work with. They made the day easier and happier. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with a huge crowd by myself. Sometimes I get in a large amount of people at the same time and it gets difficult not only to make sure everyone gets checked in in a timely manner but that everyone stays happy as well. The best part is the people. I meet someone new every day. I learn about different cultures and experience different beliefs and customs."
good,"Company was great to work for offer great benefits as far as staying at other marriots, however the work load, salary were not. Love this job thought. Met lots of great people staying with us and co workers."
good,"Best le meridien in india,"

good,Marriott is a great place where you can grow and learn a lot. My co-workers were great to work with.
good, 
good,Great Hotel Management but Restaurant Management and staff is awful. They dont know how to treat or hire good employees and hotel managements' hands are tied...too bad.
good,"A typical day at work is little bit hectic, but thats common all over nowadays, there are ample of learning opportunities, management is very aggressive,and my co workers are also supportive, the most enjoyable part of a job is interacting with clients, foreigners"
good,Attended a Job Corps student leadership conference in May 2011. Staff was courteous and respectful.
good,Enjoyed my co workers but not so much the management team. tools for jobs were never provided. employees were over worked. breaks were rarely given always had to write them in. management was never around when you need them
good,"Residence Inn was a good place to work. There was a low pressure environment. The work was mostly a little clean-up and a whole bunch of customer care. Being a careful driver, I made excellent tips."
good,Quality Service. Friendly Work Environment. Little opportunity for growth.
good,It was okay tho I didnt get the proper training I was supposed to get which led to me being laid off and lack of communication  but overall the staff were great
good,"I love Marriott in grapevine, the management was terrible. The guest made me happy and they were extremely appreciative. The pay could’ve been better (I’m very experienced). Overall other than the manager & poor pay, it was great."
good,"Review is based on a franchise Marriott. Poor management and outdated property. "
good,"Managers are not good and supportive, i. Worked eith Marriott jaipur hotel, ground team. Is good. But top. Level. Management is worst no support for shifts"
good,I enjoy working at the hotel I enjoy meeting new people and cleaning. Its organized well put together. I never have major problems that's can not befixed. They stay on top of everything.
good,It has good benefits. Take advantage of lateral service because when it's no hours you have alot of days off. Learn different stuff in other departments so you can work when your department is slow
good,"great place to start learning in a larger environment, co-operative staff and management to help and teach throughout. great enthusiasm in team and highly collaborative."
good,"I love meeting new people. I enjoyed the location of the hotel. I stayed busy, and learned how to ensure the trust of our guests. This place was a great place to work."
good,"Marriot as a company is a great well managed employer. I especially enjoyed working for the Ritz Carlton. However working for the W hotel brand has left a bad taste in my mouth, with an overall lack of passion from the union talent and a weak executive committee the hotel left much potential to be desired."
good,"Favoritism play a lot more in this job. Manager had favorite and there ones who got recognize , over and over while other work more than other to prove"
good,"A typical work day at the bistro was 9+ hour shift no break , then you don’t have a cheft of weekends so you had to do everything by yourself and they wouldn’t hire more people. The job did teach me something’s , like I learned about food and management because we didn’t work with a manager so we had to do it ourselves. The culture of the work place is just drama and I know there will be drama everywhere but this was too much for me. The hardest part was working 9+ hours not being able to take a break and eat and you couldn’t eat the food there unless you paid 20 dollars for a burger but you never find time to eat it because it was only 2 people working the whole shift. The enjoyable part was the discounts and the money because of our tips that’s what made our checks not the 9.00/hr"
good,"This job allowed me to attend school during the day and work at night. Maintenance, housekeeping, front desk, and kitchen staff work great together to help keep the guest happy."
good,This was a very fun place to work and the management when I was first hired was the bomb. Most people now are just worried about filling positions and not concerned about the ones who actually brought them the business.
good,I think it was a great experience.It was fun and I wanted to grow with the company.I think something's could have been different.It was A easy job if u like to clean.
good,"As a Houseman I setup banquet rooms for up, coming events. And I also broke the rooms down after the events. And I also enjoyed meeting all the different people."
good,"I always liked getting up and going to work here. I liked i was able to work at my own pace but in the end it didnt benefit me because i was very quick at cleaning the rooms and did it efficiently. I liked the "
good,"Happy working in the hotel everyday, "
good,Management isn't great at all. The reason I'am looking to leave this job is because of those reasons. Its never clear of who's really running the hotel.
good,"The Westin Charlotte is a BEAST, to say the least. The volume of guests we see on a daily basis can be as much as 678 rooms to as little as 150 rooms. Regardless of HOW MANY people we come in contact with each day, one thing stays the same - do whatever it takes to make them feel welcome and satisfied. The Westin has taught me how to multi-task managing a diverse team while still giving excellent service to our guests. Everyone here is like family, we work hard with and for one another, while not being afraid to share in another's successes or short comings. It's difficult to balance pleasing the guest when they sometimes are unreasonable, but it's most rewarding when you know you have completely changed the outlook of the hotel and company as a whole from negative to positive just by simply giving exceptional service."
good,"Very busy, not enough employees. Employees were great to work with. Could use better management in the housekeeping department. Could use better pay and some kind of a reward every once in a while."
good,A hotel where we can see the one of the hard working place and also the staffs. If the rooms are full we cant able to give the proper service to the Guest. I learned there how to work hard a full day without tired.
good,I was some what satisfied to a certain extent. The manager was wasn't being quit far at all. She was very well unorganized in a way. Very frustrating job only when her day wasn't going great.
good,Lots of schedule flexibility. But the company has a high turn over rate. Employee discount is a very limited availability. Also has the option to be a work from home opportunity.
good,"As I worked with my father, we did things at our own pace, but got the job done, a combination of physical work and office work. Getting experience of both."
good,the head chef was amzing nice and took time to show you what you had to do and made it if more as a time was working together I prep cooked and took orders from guess and manager
good,"Typical day began with reviewing requisitions placed by the Hotel's chefs. The food is of the finest standards with strong emphasis on locally grown, raised and made ingredients. Fabulous selection of wine and liquor with craft cocktails. Beautiful atmosphere both inside and out. Team focused, goal oriented, and focused on results. Cutting edge recycling program for the area."
good,"I have worked at the Westin on Bridge street now for seven years. I have been trained for every position in housekeeping including the supervisor position that I held for four years. I enjoyed meeting with the guest, and providing them with a memorable guest experience. I made  wonderful friends that I will miss when I move on to another profession, I enjoyed training the new employees and there wasn't a day that went by someone asked for my opinion as to best provide quality care for our guest. The job was good hard work, that always had a challenge to over come, this kept me alert and ready for whatever the day had to offer."
good,I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It was an amazing property that I wish I was able to express my skills to.
good,"I come in and start putting out racks and carts. Then I count in my draw and start ringing customers up as they come to the counter. With time permitted I would straighten up the shoes and purses. Empty trash cans, and take the go back to the production room."
good,to ensure that the staff are being very hospitable and courteous ensuring the guest every needs are meet.
good,Wish it would have been something other than a temporary position
good,Never the same thing  I learn to be prepared for what ever comes your way  Fun place to work.  Management was not all that great & most of my co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was finding&repairing leaks The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer smiles
good,"Fun work environment, however no real room for advancement. The hardest part of the job is the schedule."
good,"•	Execute recipes and menus for brunch, lunch and dinner services in a fine dining restaurant"
good,"I enjoy working with food, a typical day at work can range from preparing food for 20 people to 1000. I learned how to work in a team and how to appreciate my work. The hardest part of the job can be the long hours, sometimes we work 12 hour shifts with no break."
good,Management in this particullar property needs a lot of training
good,"Could be a lot better, I believe the managers should be reevaulated. most coworkers were cool some were not. the hardest part of the job was the pay. I loved the job in its self easy work."
good,"I work mostly 2nd shift at this hotel, which means I mainly check in guests and make sure all their needs are met. If there is a guest issue I use the best decision making skills I have to make sure the guest is happy and to solve any issues."
good,prep food
good,"The Marriott is a great place to work for social butterflies that want to meet new and exciting people that become life time friends. On the other hand, the management is bad with their constant attitudes and overrated racism."
good,"i used to cleaned and setup the rooms,.the hardest part of the job is cleaning pent houses and vip rooms"
good,"They only hire part-time and you will have to work weekends. They dont pay much, but you have the benefit of associate rate dicounts at all Marriott Hotels."
good,Very easy to use even for someone who isn’t good on smart phones . Help organize and easy to use . Makes me feel better that I can use it with out an struggle.
good,The good about the company was the benefits an the fact they care about there. Employees an that managers took care of there workers.Great gm to work wit
good,"Didn’t like the seniority union they had, gets really slow but pays well,  managers sometimes only care about the guests and housekeeping team gets the worst half"
good,Typical work day was very busy 24/7. In my last role as an IT Manager I was responsible for all IT related systems day and night. The staff were extremely understanding and supportive.
good,"Era un buen empleo hasta que vendieron el hotel a otra empresa, la cual no daba una buena impresión."
good,Customer service is key the customer is the most important part of the job making sure that the customer is satisfied and taken care of in a quick and convenient manner
good,Enjoyed working with Marriott. Get to meet a lot of professionals. Hospitality is at it's highest in Marriott. I've learned a lot from Marriott. Best place to work
good,Its a place where you interact with so many different kinds of guest coming from different part on earth. Everyday is challenging and its more about the service you provide to the guests during their stay with us.
good,"Working at this company will give you good benefits, however the blood, sweat and tears that go into this job made it not worth my time. There's almost a slavery mentality that goes along with the seniority culture that is there. The union has bred an entire generation of laziness. And if you value your work ethic or are new to the company and low on the totem pole that means YOU will have to pick up their slack. Supervisors and management just go along with it because making employees accountable is too much involvement for their taste. My advice is to find a more respectable airline in order to receive the same, if not better benefits without the politics."
good,My sales team was exceptional! Was able to represent 13 different Marriott properties in the New Orleans and Metairie area.  It used to be called Market Sales.  I handled the International Wholesaler Market.
good,"I had the opportunity to work face to face with our clients during check in and check out. However, we were very understaffed and therefore had to work more hours than I had suspected when taking the job."

good,"Great customers, take the information about the car such as mark, color, plate number. Park the car and keep the keys at the safe place, pull out the car when it requested by the owner. Receive payment."
good,The most enjoyable part of working there was having coworkers and supervisors that care for you. Every morning consisted of a short meeting to help us be better employees.

good,I have been with Marriott hotels in some fashion since I was 19 and in college. I agree whole heartedly with Mr. Marriott’s core values that if managers and leaders take care of their associates the associates will take care of the guests and the guests will take care of the revenue of a hotel.
good,"I've worked within the Marriott Brand of Resorts for the better part of 20 years. I found the experience in all of my positions rewarding, and exciting at times."

good,"Muchas capacitacion, nuevas técnicas de trabajo, evaluacion y retroalimentacion"

Marriott International, through their employee website offers many tools for self improvement and it is a huge plus.  My day to day activities consist of checking and replying to emails, and reaching out to different departments if needed to help reach 100% guest/group satisfaction.  Recording our revenue from the day or days before and breaking them down to different segments to have a better idea where the hotel is and where we need to improve to reach our monthly revenue goals.

I am in charge of printing daily reports, updating files, training new employees/interns as well as inspecting rooms and making sure the front desk is running smoothly. The management at this job is run very well. My manager always accepts new ideas and is willing to talk about issues in the workplace that are always being improved. My co-workers all work as a team and are all unique individuals which makes the workplace a great environment to be around. The hardest part of the job is the weekend and holiday hours. It is very hard to schedule anything outside of work because of the hours that I am working at this job.

All departments work very well together, which is extremely important in the industry.  Not that it is without obstacles, but the team works hard to overcome them daily. Our most difficult obstacles typically involve building issues- such as leaks in public areas or renovations that cannot be easily obscured from guests' view. There really is no ""typical"" day in hotels, as anything and everything can happen. Most enjoyable are the bonds we form with our guests.  We have so many recurring guests that getting to know them and making them really feel at home when they stay with us is extremely rewarding.  "

good,"Great place to work the management team is great and everyone is friendly,"
good,"As a front desk associate my duties include greeting guest, checking them in and out of the hotel, addressing complaints and issues, delegating rooms, and answering phones. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate guests who have had an unpleasant experience. The most enjoyable part is meeting interesting people and the family like atmosphere of being around friendly co-workers. The discounts that an associate recieves for other Marriott properties around the world is awesome. I went to Miami and a room that would cost $449 a night, cost me $136 a night. In Vegas a room that was $380 a night, I recieved for $89 a night."

I got along with the manager until they replaced him.  The new manager got rid of employees to replace them with her family and boyfriend (who replaced me).  I got along with all the co-workers even those that were replace.  The hard part of the job was being on call and having to go in after midnight.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and being around a very nice and clean environment."
good,I was given many opportunities while at Marriott. The most enjoyable part of my job was providing support to the hotels. The least enjoyable part of my job was the extremely heavy work load.

But when it does get busy in high season it none stop phone calls and its a great place to work if you love the fast life.I enjoy what i do but its time for a new place where i can grow and expand. The coworkeers here well its hard to get them to work as a team but when we do its a breeze.

good,Marriott was an excellent company to work for with many chances to shift departments and advance your career.  Unfortunately it was subject to the vagaries of the market place with occasional reductions in force.
good,Typical day of work is very stressful but enjoyable. Daily tips and different customers makes the day go by fast. Great company to wok for and great benefits.
good,"Marriott is an AMAZING company, however, very competitive.  Be careful who you  trust as you can easily find yourself on a ""list"".  If you are not careful, a hungry person in line for your job can make one statement and you find yourself out the door without any opportunity to react."

good,"I enjoyed my time with Westin Princeville and left for personal reasons. Employees tend to stay a long time. They have a wonderful General Manager who has been leading the resort since its opening. I had the opportunity to explore management and was grateful for the opportunity to advance in my career.  Although I ultimately ended up returning to a concierge role to have more time for other important matters in my life, I still enjoyed my time with the company very much. It's a beautiful work environment and they have a fairly structured training program for associates.  I developed personally and professionally."
good,"Marriot is a really good place to work while in school with little experience. Depending on your position, it could really improve whatever your life goals are. Otherwise, its a nice paying job that is flexible. Management comes and goes often due to conflict of interest. But that could just have been my location. Many great benefits and overall an enjoyable experience"

Suddenly the phones are ringing off the hook with: questions, complaints, concerns, tantrums, frustrations, money issues, booking rooms, canceling rooms. There is really no limit to the accommodations that need to be made to ensure that a guest is happy. However, this is my favorite part of the job, when someone has a problem that just seems like the world is crumbling for them, and I can problem solve and move things around for them, it truly makes me happy.  There is no better feeling than having a guest come at you yelling and angry and tired, and see them leave your front desk smiling and have their experience completely turned around for the better. If you have thick skin and can keep a smile while being yelled at then this job is perfect. It was for me and I loved the customer service aspect of it. Just time manage, keep track of each individual staying and their personal needs and you'll do great."

good,"This was my first real hotel experience and I was the Food & Beverage Intern during the summer.  I worked side by side with the Food & Beverage manager and learned the day to day operations of a typical manager within a hotel.  By the end of my time I was making schedules, approving payroll, product orders and overseeing a restaurant staff of 30."
good,"Working for Marriott is one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had. This job has many pros, and in my experience only one (1) con. My management was ineffective because of the of the lack of  capacity to manage administrative assistants. The feedback I received was never about my performance, but about my physical appearance e.g. ""you should straighten your hair"", ""you should get you finger nails professionally done"". "

good,"Working all day answering phones and setting hotel reservation is very monotonous but it made the day go by fast.  I learned how to make the guest feel confident in what they were purchasing and how to solve problems when guests were upset or something didn't go right for their stay.  I felt that the management was a big help in learning how to maneuver the reservations system and the call center environment.  I didn't really feel that co-workers were encouraged to communicate.  There were not a lot of opportunities to get a break from the monotony of being tethered to a desk and phone, they gave you one five minute interval all day to go to the bathroom or what ever personal time outside of the two fifteen minute breaks that were spaced hours apart.  I would have liked to be able to move around more.  I did enjoy being able to help guests find the perfect fit for their vacations and travel needs."

good,I love my job. Would love to make more money on the hour. We have a very stressful job and work to hard for the money that we make
good,"Free food"
good,"The average work environment is full of specific distinctive disfunction such as favoritism, special interest, cliques and over all to much of a social cold war especially for the caliber of work done. In my own opinion you can not come to work and just work, differing opinions posture for stereotypical outcomes over all. All in all my gripe is the rule books are used every now and again leaving larger work loads for those whom aren't social enough to read between the lines, word of mouth do not only spread good business but bad rumors. "
good,i learned many new things in my westin hotels since it is a starwood property the managment is also goodapart from that my coworkers r also good

good,At the Marriott Marquis there is no typical day.
good,"It was a normal, busy day working for them. I had to try and paint the corridors while housekeeping was doing their jobs with the trolleys. I learnt what it would be like to work for in a trade or an apprenticeship, it is hard work. We had a good management system, got told the schedules, fire exits, first aid and who was our assioates on the interview day. I had two other college collegues with me doing the work experience and we was doing the corridors, public rooms and also the guests rooms. Hardest part was working around housekeeping and making sure I am not doing anyone any harm with the equipment on me. the most enjoyable part was getting along well with the staff and the guests that was arriving in the hotel."
good,"Working for the marriot was great. I really loved by job there. Until they hired a exec. chef and her and I hit it off at first but then, well then we didn't. I moved to windsor and was still driving in for a few hours a week it was the recession and everyones hours got cut so i filled out a app on craigslist and got the job for aramark"
good,"I enjoyed helping customers with check-in, check-out and any issues they might have. What I did not enjoy was how the management say one thing but does another. Even when we were full and customers were upset or angry when they come in, they usually left with a smile on there face after I helped them. To me customer satisfaction is the best you can have and I receive numerous compliments for the company and that is not bragging that is a fact."

good,"Answer phones, check people in/out, handle guest complaints and requests"
good,"I would come into work, clock in. They had me as a server or cook, so as a server I would go into the bistro area and see what I needed from storage to make sure we were stocked for the morning. Then I would go get my cash drawer from the front desk. And then start my paper work for the day along with counting my cash in my drawer to make sure it was not over or under. Then I would go into the kitchen to get what I needed for out front. And if coffee was not made I had to make coffee. Then we would open for breakfast and I would ring people in the registar, make them starbucks coffees if they asked. Run the food when ready to serve to the customer, keep the bistro area cleaned and stocked. And when breakfast was over clean up the bistro area, and stock for the next morning. Count my drawer and make a drop. As a cook I would go into the kitchen and turn on all the equipment for the day, and start cooking and doing prep-work for that day or the next. As orders would come in I would cook them and if there was not a runner, run the food to the customer when ready. At the end of the day I would wash all the dishes and put them away when cleaned. Sweep and mop the floors and turn off the equpiment. When the stock truck came in I would put the food away and date it. I learned that in a job like this team work and communication is very important ! I had wonderful management in every department of the hotel. I had very wonderful co-workers, the hardest part of my job I would say taking alot of customers orders in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job i would say would be"
good,"would check my e-mails and voice mail for guest would would like to set up a block of rooms or come by hotel to see or set up there next events. Working with all the hotel staff, hands on. This job is not hard for me because I love it so much."
good,"Imprimir requisiciones de las dieferentes áreas a surtir, inventarios siclicos, preveer faltantes, generar requisiciones de compra, revisar información de eventos con involucrados para darle seguimiento a posibles necesidades, generar salidas y reportes de almacén, generar poliza de salidas, cotejar entradas a modulo de inventarios con reporte de compras, cotejar poliza de salida de almacén con contabilidad."
good,I found it to be a very lovely place to have the pleasure to work. They really try to make the guest feel like it is a home away from home. I enjoyed working with all the staff and guests. It was a very rewarding experience!
good,Enjoyed working at the Westin. The only concern is that you work hard for little pay. They need to distribute the work load better and divide up their grill station.
good,"Dealt with guests, management and co-workers"
good,Great Company to work for. Management is very good and willing to listen to concerns and complaints.
good,"Job security is not always there, Marriott is very professional organized in the UAE and has access to the best programs and software. Marriott is very strong in training tools."
good,Working at my particular Marriott has been a great experience. It currently still is my current place of work. I enjoy the fact that I am given the tools I need to succeed and the freedom to make decisions in order to take care of the guests!
good,"Great place to work. Marriott provides the opportunity to deliver customer service to all guests. "
good,"At times can be fast paced, you're able to meet many new people. For the most part it's really nice place to work. All the unworthy managers are no gone."
good,"Nice working environment and feel like family."
good,This was a good experience and the timing of the duty was not proper. The service and the care given by the company was great..off days didnt follow proper for trainees here
good,The Operation Manager play favorite with his employees at the location I work he didn’t treat u fair across the broad u where good as long as ur a female
good,"I worked as a night auditor and loved the time I had to do thing's i needed to do in the middle of the night, the only problem in working there was my health was shot from the late night shifts and that was a me thing so it was a great time over all"
good,Great place to work they fuel employee with good meetings and want great guest satisfaction that is job one.give you what you need to do job correctly!
good,"Worked for 9 years with Marriott, enjoyed every day. Always something exciting happening; if not the employees it was definitely the customers. Very fun place to work.  Sorry they left."
good,"Marriot hotel was a great job and buiness, Im proud I had a chance to work there, I love and support marroit hotels, Im a hard and easy to like worker,marriot was my favorite job"
good,Working for Marriott was quite the experience. The Marriott I got hired at wasn’t directly owned by Marriott it was bought by plamondum or something like that . So they did things a little different from regular tradition and they don’t treat employees with the same respect as Marriott should .
good,"It was  a great experience working with such a variety of people. The enthusiasm, friendliness and culture is great. New people are taken on with great care and fun. They make sure that new entrants feel like home."
good,Marriott International company really strong company in hotel sphere. Biggest concern with famous brands. A lot of job places in each department. Unfortunately this company provide slow development and low payment for hospitality staff.
good,"Great organization to work for. Learned a lot in the hospitality business, but the organization culuture is changing rapidly and people are no longer valued!"
good,I worked for the Marriott a couple times while I was in college. It's an easy and fun job to work to make extra money when needed. I recommend to any college students.
good,"I liked working at the hotel over the summer it was nice and everybody their was helpful, about showing me the ropes of things. They give you extra hours if  you need them."
good,"Managment make you belive that he cares for you but avious they don't, annual raise is 3% of your salary that would be about $0.45-$0.50 a year if your lucky enough to get one. In my position as Engineering I was working 3rd shift and when I needed PTO it was a sttuggle to get it since nobody wanted to cover my shift. To get sick you need to be duying in order to be off for the same reason nobody wants to cover your shift. Would never let you change shifts and your stuck with it for as long as your there."
good,"Friendly and family environment. Everyone feels like a friend. Self paced, just get your work done. No lack of standards and consistent expectations from all departments"
good,Excellent to work for as a Field Representative!  Great disciplines to assist you on any construction issue.  Would actually take a decrease in pay to return.
good,The staff was amazing and very helpful to the best of their abilities. Teamwork was a major thing that was a great part of the job. Each person who stayed enjoyed and some even tipped.
good,A Typical work day for me is to come in before your event get started. so you can start prep before its time so you can be ready. 
good,I would have to say that I really loved working for the company and was able to learn so much. Enjoyed the different personalities that came through the doors
good,"It's a great place to work for housekeeping, but there is no option for advancement to other departments (at least, from my experience). Co-workers and management are like family to me--the best part of the job, in my opinion. The downside is that when hotel occupancy is low, housekeepers hours are cut (especially around holidays--Thanksgiving and Christmas)"
good,I enjoyed work at the Renaissance with a wonderful staff and we also had free lunch also the General Manager was awesome And also the HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER WAS AWESOME
good,"A new business is hard to open, a new hotels more so but with the proper hierarchy, an opening can be smooth. Almost a year from opening and still with a bare-bones crew only starting the hiring process now. This means long hours and long weeks. But there are many rays of sunshine that poke through the clouds."
good,Me gusta la forma en que capacitan y te hacen sentir que eres parte de marriott
good,"Look all reservation."
good,"i really enjoyed working here, thier facilities are great and organized. they provide essentials to do your work, they do their best to work with you on certain subjects like scheduling, they could have did better at it though. and trusting their co workers i wish they had looked into my case more but over all the staff is great if you go through their company an dont  a hiring agency."
good,best job i have ever had want to go back they need to change their attendance policy could be better and they need to be on the same page with policies other than that the job is great although some phone calls are crazy
good,It was a great job. You get to be involved in and around a lot of successful people. Fun work environment. Benefits can be received. They have a lot of events they put together for staff and their family. It can be a great learning experience.
good,"Overall a great work place, a lot of benefits, food was amazing"
good,"It is unfair of me to rate poorly on Marriott as a whole, it is just the management at the location I am at is AWFUL. They ask you to speak up and feel comfortable when facing an issue but then ignore every word out of your mouth. Very unprofessional."
good,Renaissance hotel is just a job to me to it’s a part of my life. the training and love and  support  Is next to none . The overall experience  mold me to the person I am today
good,I was a amazing experience to work at the Marriott courtyard hotel I had a great time there I was a little stressed out at times but I was amazing experience.
good,Great team great management team always positions open to move up and grow the best then about working there was it Gass the ability to up and move you to a new location which is always fun
good,The job was very easy and I enjoyed working there. The Food and Beverage manager at the time was not easy to work with at all. Other departmental heads were very nice and easy to talk to. Overall I had a good experience but left because I could not work with the manager.
good,"Great company to work for with good benefits and compensation.  Chances for lateral move are available, though it may be hard to be promoted due to nepotism."
good,"Any hospitality position can be great if you are willing to move, you can grow into any position you desire.  Those that bounced from city to city, really excelled."
good,They couldn't keep a general manager. The turnover rate for workers was unreal and people would call in all the time.  The assistant manager is an awesome woman.
good,"My opinion is that the hotel is a great place to focus on, I have management skills from my previous employer, their culture is great and with meeting guest from around the globe visiting us is what I have learn and put in place here. The hotel was recently purchased by a new owner call Arbor Lodging so everything is still new with their procedures. The most part of the position I like is meeting people and talking with them. Their really is no hardest to the position other than being a people person."
good,"In winter, when tourism slows down, available work hours drop because there are so few people staying at the hotel. April through September is a huge challenge for Housekeepers because the hotel sells out on a regular basis. It's a big challenge to clean 90+ guest rooms between 11:00 a.m.(check out) and 3:00 p.m.(check in)."
good,I loved working at Marriott but didn’t like the flexible Schedule or no pay for over time. It was an easy looking forward job to do. The guest were great to talk to and hear about their travels.
good,"The Ritz-Carlton was an excellent company to work for and with. Amazing leaders in may cases and loss of culture for Ritz-Carlton, which was the greatest con."
good,"•	Coordinate sales team by managing schedules, filing important documents and communicating relevant information"
good,"it was avery diverse place very supportive management great team players,"
good,Enjoyed working at this hotel.  Employees have high standards to meet guests expectations.  The environment is very pleasant.  Customers have high standards and are generally enjoyable to provide services for.
good,"Trabalhei duas vezes nessa empresa."
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing up customers and enjoying their stories about where they live, where they are traveling to, the places they have visited and seen."
good,"The atmosphere is very good, I have learnt a lot in dealing with varying personalities of co-workers and clients.  The management staff is very accommodating and upbeat.  We have an ethnic background of workers so a bit of different cultures is brought in the workplace environment on a daily basis.  The hardest part of my day is inspecting several different merchandise alone from at least ten clients.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team and getting the job done in a timely manner."
good,"from security point of view is when there is a multiple medical emergency and fire alarm emergency. "
good,"Good management, a healthy environment for the staff, friendly manager with open door policy, a good handling stresses and giving a training to staff (each staff must achieve training hours provided)."
good,"Marriott International, gives you many opportunities to grow in the business. It is up to each individual person to make that growth happen. You can't just talk the talk you have to walk the walk to get where you want to get in your career goals."
good,It has been 9 months working with marriott.working from pre opening. Of Fairfield marriott. It was a great journey. All the HOD's are of friendly nature.the best thing about marriott is its open door policy.you can directly to your HOD or to the GM if you are having some problem regarding the work.or else you can share your ideas with them.
good,Good place to work but unfortunate there a lot of drama with the housekeeper personals. The supervisor was a latin girl and she used her work position to mistreat other co workers
good,"Marriott international as a company offers fantastic benefits that are accessible at all levels of employment.  Due to the great benefits however, actual monetary compensation is limited for lower level or hourly positions."
good,Working for this company was great. It was fast paced and always so much to do and learn. It was a great first job and i truly think it is a great place to work.
good,The job was customer service orientated.  It required helping guests book hotel rooms or resolving account access issues.  The job worked excellent with college schedules.
good,The Westin Kierland is a phenomenal resort.  We are a market leader in both Group and Transient business.  We are tops in our CompSet in Leisure business by capturing 40%+ of the wholesale maket.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at the Ritz; it was like a second family/home to me. "
good,my hardest part of the job was dealing with one of my coworkers she was very aggressive and had a nasty attitude. I brought it to management attention however nothing was done about it. Management let me go due to miscommunication from my supervisor. I recommend employees to always have a witness when brought into office.
good,"this company is very good. top brand in the world i working with this company  3 years .here all associate is very frankly."
good,"I learned a lot working here, they give good trainings, but some departments are hard in schedule, in my experience a very time demanding job, no time to live my life, to much overtime required."
good,Its a fairly smaller and older hotel but the staff as whole work well together. Management is always there when you need them. Coming to work is pleasant.
good,They have great benefits.But they can improve in schedules and the way they treat some employees I believe its not in every area of the Hotel.Your Work/Life balance its always not good. I love to have contact with the public and I embraced our daily customers we became family. The company gave us a great uniform very classy.
good,Event Management is an amazing team and it is very much a team effort in everyway because the workload varies in different seasons it very helpful to have a team to help when you are busy.
good,"my typical day at work is coming in too make sure my guest night was satisfying and all needs are met. Then I tend to breakfast make sure my guest supplied with all breakfast amenities they need. Being at this property the first impression is the main impression the guest remembers, no matter how their stay was they will always remember the one person that checked them in. At this property im longest person that's been here, and the management team is actually great, but my number one thing is communication. The thing I enjoy the most about my job is the guest, I love to see my guest satisfied and happy, my guest will return and also pass the word around about my property. In most cases the guest is my motivation. I personally I want train and grow as much as I can in the Marriott Business, so I can train other people as well."
good,"The entire staff I worked with were always very out going, uplifting, welcoming people. My managers were amazing, always taking care of their employees. Worked with your schedule, especially if you were going to school. "
good,"start at 11pm until 8am"
good,"-very busy place"
good,"My typical day starts at 5 am I am the first daytime employee on site.    "
good,"The people who work here are nice everyone always greets you when you come in. Vibrant personalities for the hotel and corporate department.Work Well. Keep your head up and you will leave and arrive knowing that you did your best and anyone could ask for, improve yourself every day, ask for evaluation every week or moth"
good,It's simple my job was easy and fun basically did what I wanted but my manager is arrogant. Did not listen iud care about my needs or requests and took the word of other employees weigh 5 seemingly no intention of asking me.
good,My ratings are for the franchises company that manages the Marriott I work for.  I would love to work for a corporate opporated Marriott in the very near future.
good,"answering phones and assisting guest with hotel accommodations."
good,"The Westin is a great place to work if you're looking for fun, friendly,  and accommodating employers who strive to meet your needs. The staff at The Westin really try to reward their employees and keep them happy."
good,"greet staff and customers"
good,"Dedicada "
good,over all good working involvement need to improve care to  employee  but over all we say ok. Need to be take care of all employee  on the same point of view
good,Towne Place Suites is a great place to work. Management is courteous to your needs. Working here is very rewarding. Working with the public can be stressful but you can't help but feel great after a hard days work knowing that you made a difference in someone's life.
good,Starwood approved my medical leave on April 3rd and fired me April 4th. I feel like that is unfair since i was made to believe that my job waa secure. A good job unless you are handicapped with an illness. Benefits and pay are good.
good,I really enjoyed the interaction with the guest that came to the hotel. I also had a great report with my fellow employees which made working at the hotel easy.
good,"Muy bueno.El.ambient de trabajo,en ese entonces,habran cambiado las cosas supongo. Exigentes pero era necesario. Una hora de descanso.comedor en planta.buen.clima de trabajo."

good,"A typical work day is busy."
good,"Working in a hotel creates a fun outgoing experience. Meeting guests from all around the world, makes my job more to look forward to. My main goal is to make someones stay as comfortable,and as enjoyable as possible.  Managing a hotel on busy nights can be rough, but its a challenge I love taking on and always seem to learn something new!"
good,Working at the Westin Riverfront Resort and Spa was a tremendous experience!! I started working there when it was still a construction site and had not opened for business yet. The work ethic from the General Manager to the part time banquet server was incredible!! To be able to watch a hotel go from construction to a successful business was incredibly gratifying!
good,"The management is awesome. Very friendly, homey business to work in. You meet new and different people everyday. The Marriott is more like a family not a business."
good,"Family feeling to company, supportive line managers. great colleagues, vast opportunities to train and develop, positive approach by all. Pay structure is quite restrictive as is holiday entitlement. Communication from top can be slow. Good training scheme for the maintenance departments. Typical day is all about meeting the engineering targets and maintain the indexes high which sometimes you need people to do the job but they are not willing to hire more."
good,The resort allowed me to entertain different types of guests as we housed most of Savannah tourists. The staff was amazing and everyone was treated equally
good,Nice place to work love the hours and always busy. Constantly working my day went really fast and met all kinds of people. Good hours and always kept busy
good,I really enjoy working here. Get to talk to great people and see where and why they are traveling. Great place to work! Needs a little help in management and training their employees.
good,"Checking guests in/out, and talking to guests on daily basis is always beneficial. I like working for Marriott, and would recommend it to young adults."
good,"very busy in full occupancy ,i really learn a lot wen it come to bar and service,management is quite ok and co worker are very friendly .the difficult part is wen water puns up from the pool to the bar.the most enjoyable part is staff party"
good,"I have learned a lot for vendor management, strong administration, negotiation skills etc."
good,I am thankful to this place and my team and my seniors to make me learn alot of things and the way to work calmly in buzy situation as well.I am thankful to this property for my career start.
good,I did enjoy my job as much as I could  there is each employed giving  his  own opinions regarding to  his job and his responsibility.   my   opinion there was how  powerful I'm and follow my instructions do my best to provide a good services for my company to grow

good,"-checking guests in and out of hotel, making/canceling reservations, helping out with with guest needs."
good,"Hospitality is no easy feat.  This industry has taught me endless incomparable principles, both in business and ethics.  "
good,"I work here part-time and am eligible for great benefits:"
good,This is an overall good company to work for. Every hotel under Marriott is different. I have learned so much by becoming apart of the Marriott family.
good,"After receiving your assignment, you start loading the truck. You continue loading until the order is complete. Once completed, turn in the worksheet to invoicing and receive another order to be filled. You keep doing this until the job is completed. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting, it is a very physical job."
good,"Marriott is a great and World Wide know chain to work for. They offer a lot of internal training for employees to grow and better themselves"
good,"Nice place to work. Fast paced at times, and mostly enjoyed meeting people from all over the world on a daily basis. Salary was low, and needed to look for a better salary to survive."
good,"Perfect team workers"
good,"I really enjoy engaging with guests and making sure everyone enjoys their stays. The hotel is beautiful and they completed necessary renovations which is nice. However, the staff needs a serious attitude adjustment. The managers don't recognize or appreciate good work and only talk to you when they have something to coach you on, and instead of promoting from within, you see consistent outside hires, so how can you grow in the company if they never let you? I would stay at the hotel if the staff was more open minded and fun, it's hard to be the only individual that does way more than necessary and gets to thanks or appreciation."
good,Love meeting Marriott Elite guest that has been with the company for years. I was able to meet movie stars and the Colts team stayed in our Hotel.
good,"Great place for early morning work.  Enjoyed my co-workers and the customers.  Would have stayed but moved to California."
good,I learned all the different aspects of running a hotel. Management was easy going. Hardest part was staying up at night. Most enjoyable part was meeting all sorts of people from different parts of the world.
good,"Reconciling cash accounts on a monthly basis. Great GAAP knowledge and skills.Great leaders and always willing to work with you on any issue personal or business. The people are great and friendly. Hardest part was long days,most enjoyable was the teamwork environment."
good,"Well organized and comfortable to stay and work with. The working place is very near from the accommodation. Free on everything is an advantage such as accommodation, mas gym , basketball court, and most of all the place is very safe."
good,"I valeted any high-end or low-end cars in a garage behind the hotel. I also, greeted guest, helped with luggage, bell hopped, concierge, haled taxi's and transportation. security, managed inventory of cars, and helped guest with the W motto of whatever- whenever service. Example: Directions throughout New Orleans, attractions, to even the mints or flowers on a guest's pillow."

good,"Managing kitchen brigade efficiently.Building a team by inspiring, training and motivating young chef with little experience. Keeping the kitchen operation efficient, profitable and interresting to work for."
good,"I feel i would still be working here, if the economy had not fallen during my employment. I was sad to be laid off, especially after receiving so many awards are praises due to my work ethic."
good,"I was an administrative assistant in the sales office.  A typical work day included at times up to 20 to 30 contracts prepared a day for sales managers.   I was very fortunate to have sales managers lead, guide and mold me into what I am today.  Worked there for 12.5 years.  I feel very fortunate to have these people in my life and their constant support.   The hardest part of the job was watching other departments not communicate well with their team member's.   The most enjoyable part of my job was providing customer service to everyone that came to The Westin Atlanta Airport to conduct business or parties.   It was constantly busy and always moving and groovin'!  :-)"
good,"it was great and valuable experience in hotel. timing of job are so hard which i find."
good,"Le - meridean is leading property of Starwood Group.Working with le- meridean was another good experience.I was working as Guest relation executive.my job profile was welcoming guest to the hotel .taking them through the check-in process,escording them to their rooms,reaching extra mile in service ,looking after guest satisfaction by solving their problems,making their staying comfortable."
good,"All hosts are required to go above and beyond to ensure quality guest satisfaction. I am always learning and experimenting with infusions and mixtures as per my guest's acquired taste. While tending to my guests, I converse with them to know them better and will help my remember their future visits."
good,It was a very good company to work for and I enjoyed my time with them and the opportunities that were given to me. Very interactive learning environment.
good,"I really liked this hotel. You can consider it as a Boutique Design Hotel or just as a quirky hotel, but I found it really good. Especially because everything was there, and just enough, not too much. I explain : In a lot of hotels there is an abundance of everything, luxury, restaurants, space, amenities, ... and then when you need something it always takes a long while before you can get it."
good,"It´s an International brand with good benefits. The people are very nice, it´s a very good place to work."
good,"Checking guests in, offering amenities and the best of service to the guests has always been a passion of mine. It feels the best to satisfy a guest to their complete needs and see them smiling every time you see them during their stay.The worst part about the job was the management. The most important aspect of a hotel is the satisfaction of the guest. My co-workers were great, I was a team leader and recruited, trained, and lead many employees to their first stepping stones of a life-long career."
good,I enjoyed a lot of aspects working for Marriott. I got to meet a lot of diverse folks from around the globe. The employees there were friendly and management was caring about the atmosphere created.
good,"Zylo, inside the W Hotel in Hoboken is such a great atmosphere to be around especially when you have the entire skyline of New York City facing you every time you are at work. I had a great learning experience while working here in which I learned to deal with hotel guests and those who were not in the restaurant. Management is very knowledgeable in what they do but lacked communication skill within the employees. I acted as part concierge for some guests when the hotel concierge was not around and offered information to those who were not familiar with some areas around them. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with reliable co-workers."
good,"It's not not easy, hours are crazy, majority of the time the managers on duty never answer when you need help. You have 1 month free to get away with mot booking any sales but after that you get written up. Its NOT marketing as i was told in my interview its Soliciting."
good,Marriott is a great company to work for. I learned how to become a professional and develop great interpersonal skills while working in a diverse environment.
good,"I learned the art of hospitality. I also learned, how to create personal connections with guests and go above and beyond for them."
good,Great work place awesome coworkers everyone is so close knit they treated me like family since the day a started.The management staff is very supportive and treats every employer with the respect. also here at our property everyone is held accountable for there actions meaning make sure your job is done the guest is satisfied and everything is logged in the books. While working here at our property i learned so much on how to deal with and communicate with so many different personalites all while being able to maintain a professional out look on any situation. I think the hardest part of my job is not being able to help a guest once there unhappy about there stay at or property.But i can say i enjoy coming to work each morning greeting and saying hello and Good morning to each passing guest sometimes in life i think its the little things that matter the most. because good morning can put a smile on someones face might help there day go by a little bit better we never know
good,Best company you can work for!! Truly amazing people doing truly amazing things. I enjoy every minute I get to be at work helping our guests feel at home away from home.
good,"Great place to work. very fast pace place to work, always have to be on your toes, very little room for rest but overall great place to work. ."
good,"Una de las cosas que me gustaría destacar dentro de mi estadía en Marriott, una gran empresa, fue la relación familiar que existía con todos los empleados del Hotel, partiendo por el Gerente General, quien nunca se ocultó dentro del edificio, al contrario, mostraba un gran aprecio por sus anfitriones, dando el ejemplo a los otros. Así también hasta el garzón o cocinero ubicado en otra sección del lugar. La importancia que existía por el empleado, ofreciendo actividades para motivarlos."
good,"Good place to work, staff are friendly. Not the best place to be for progression and the money also isn't so great. Pro's and con's."
good,Enjoyed gaining experience in customer service and management related activities. Typical day at work involved preparing banquet center for events and post party cleaning.  While working in Housekeeping department I was able to learn people management skills
good,"Hermosa propiedad, ubicacion excelente. "
good,"I truly enjoyed this company from day one.  Marriott brand has always strived for guest satisfaction in so many ways.  I was able to learn and grow in my five and a half years with the company, and it considered it one of the best jobs I have ever held."
good,Very busy.Hotel work is not easy.Management was very oriented.Co-workers was very nice. The hardest part was when guest would leave their room in a shamble.I enjoyed meeting different people and assisting the guest.
good,"As a hotel manager it was difficult to understand the culture of the management staff. However, I took my positions as learning opportunities and I enjoyed myself."
good,"While overall this was a summer job, and I enjoyed most of my time, I was a bit upset with how the managers handled situations with other employees and felt that they blamed the one that complained about the employee that was not working over fixing the issues in the work place."
good,"Greeted each hotel guest and made them feel like a welcome guest, as well as handled hotel guest reservations. I would also attempt to achieved department targeted goals using up-selling techniques to maximize room rates and revenue"
good,good pay hard work kind bosses no experance nessacery will train some binifits lots of hrs. free suntans short breaks i dont want to tipe any more but it wont let me conitnue untill i do
good,"he aprendido a brindar un excelente servicio a dar soluciones a los inconveniente que se presentan en el dia a dia,el ambiente de trabajo es el mejor,nos concientes mucho, siempre realizan las actividades teniendo en cuenta a todos los que trabajamos en el hotel."
good,"great people with great attitudes who really care and have a passion for what the do. striving to create the home away from home where guests become friends, the company strives to better all employees and create the best you you can be."
good,"A typical day as a guest service representative was very easy and simple. I would come in, discuss all the events of the day, make certain that all guests were blocked and ready for check-in, confirm group block and preparation, complete daily competitive survey, count the bank and assist the guests. "
good,The company and really good and the job day is very busy and high paced so if that's what you like then their really good. If  you suffer from Depression like I do then you should really get a job in house and not at home.

good,Marriott was a wonderful place to work.  I was able to interact with a variety of individuals from all around the world.  Working here allowed me to hone my skills with customer relations and gain admin experience.  This was a very clerical job and dealt mostly with data entry and taking phone calls.

good,i enjoyed this position due to working with variouse nationalities and dealing with customers quiries
good,With this job i worked 50 to 60 hours some weeks. I am a team player and we were really sort handed alot and I always stayed to help when some would not.

Everyday was customer service, problem solving, dealing with money, sales, working with computers, faxing, scanning, and working with the sales team, GM, and managers on a daily basis. "
good,"when there is a rainy season, the day is really typical"
good,"The Marriott is really a great place to work, they pay wonderfully and have great benefits. They had a water park in the resort with a lazy river and water slides, four different kinds of pools, it was great. Only got to use them once though, because we had very few chances to use them. On the days we were allowed to was usually mandatory work days so no one was off. The problem I had was that the management was very disorganized, I was hired as a part time because I was starting college. They continually scheduled me for full time hours, it got to the point where I would have to tell them I wasn't coming in because I was falling behind in school. I discontinued working there after I got a call on thanksgiving night while eating dinner with y family, that there had been a change in the schedule and I was supposed to be at work that evening. He told me if I did not come in he would be forced to terminate me."
good,"I learned a great deal of business strategy from Marriott regarding the emphasis on excellent customer service, in that, satisfied customers equal return business."

good,This was a great place to work while I was in school.  I was able to support myself fairly well while maintaining a social life. 
good,"I can't say anything negative about my experience with Marriott Hotels. They gave me my first real job when I was a junior in high school back in New Orleans. After graduating high school I transferred to Marriott World Trade Center in New York City. The atmosphere is relaxing, beautiful and the people who work there were very professional yet personable. That's a combination I still have not found since Marriott. They pride themselves on employee appreciation understanding that a happy associate will provide the best customer service. This in turn will almost guarantee a repeat visit or good word of mouth promotion at the very least. "
good,"1 Execelent way of working and good service "
good,"This Job was a great learning experience. They were very family oriented. "
good,"Trabelhei como Recepcionista no unico hotel de 5 estrelas de Rotterdam na Holanda. O trabalho era bastante exigente mais eu adorava. Me traz muito prazer poder proporcionar um serviço espectacular para meus hospedes e os ver sorrir em retorno. A pior parte do trabalho na minha opinião eram os horários de trabalho que mudavam muito e quando trabalhava como o night audit, a noite inteira fechando os processos do Hotel e preparando tudo para o próximo dia. "
good,Over 10 years of working at property. Very demanding hotel connected to the convention center
good,"The typical day was never typical. There were extremely busy days due to high volume of arrivals, departures, occupancy percentages, in-house groups, conventions, events...etc. There was always a lot of activity. I learned a great deal in the various posistions I held at this company from people skills, supervisory skills, time management, generating and analzing reports, resolving credit and accounting issues, daily closing accounting reports and working on property task force teams. The hardest part of the job were the hours and shift changes. The best part of the job were the great team of people and managers in all departments and I enjoyed the work. Working on the Propery Task Force was fantastic. This required traveling to various U.S. cities and territories and setting up a new hotel (or taking over an existing propery). From installation of the systems to providing training to all departments of the new property."
good,Marriott provides a great environment to work and encourages development of its employees each day.
good,Overall is an excellant Hotel chain to be a part of. A day at wrk includes phones ringing all day. I've learned the day to day orperation of a hotel. Management is fair. The most enjoyable part of working at the Westin was my team.
good,"To clean 18 or more guestrooms. Vaccum carpeted area, high dust,disinfect bathrooms,and replace amenities and linen."
good,No such thing as typical day.
good,A typical day at work started with doing sidework picking up amenities. Daily line up to talk about events or what special guests were in house. Preparing and delivering orders also inspecting them to insure perfection and making sure they are delivered on time.
good,"Jobs usually routine, I did get cross-trained in most associate department jobs. Generally Management was involved with staff while on the job, and customers. Involvement with staff and customers was a sincere practice with Marriott, and Sodexo, who were affiliated with Marriott in Indiana University Food Service Operations. Co-workers involved alot of student employed, so though day by day operations went smoothly, the bond was not as permanent. The most difficult part of the job, yet I found most challenging and enjoyable was to monitor and insure quality food product pending on the quantity of business at any one particular time during business operations."
good,I try to provide great customer service so that our quest will want to come back and visit us again. I have learned that you have to work well with others and you deal with many different cultures. Most of my coworkers are good people whom i can trust to do their share of their work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry guest and the most enjoyable part of the job is that it can pay well at times.
good,"Typical day includes system maintenance, reservation checks, billing instructions, credit checks, delegation of duties and responsibility of duty manager while on shift."
good,"• Issues immediately to line manager, including all furniture, fittings and equipment."
good,Busy days at the spa during the summer and winter season including holidays.
good,"A day at work is quiet, customer in and out. speak to the co-worker that I relieve. close the 3rd shift. Speak to the Seurity Guard, set up the tables for breakfast. I do enjoy it. Learned the different data entry. Job is not hard, most of it is common sense."
good,"It was a roller coaster ride working in Grosvenor House, specifically in Buddha Bar Dubai. There was fun, excitement and of course challenges which made me become a better and strong person I am now. Coming to work was appealing especially on weekdays when there was less pressure from phone calls and walk in guests. However, on weekends, most especially Thursday and Friday, we all need a strong prayer to end the night without a single complain. Well, I guess, through these difficult times I was able to develop myself in handling complains and giving service recovery to make the guests happy. In this place, there is really a feel of team spirit. Management were supportive and knowledgeable. The most enjoyable part of the job is recognizing loyal guests and they recognize me also because of the best service I, together with the team provides."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Courtyard by Marriott in Middletown, NY. The staff was great & management did their best, however, some employee's were not there for the right reasons."
good,- Work with guests in the Food and Beverage Department taking orders and serving guests
good,"get to work with multipul people daily, and show my leadership skills"
good,"As a Guest Services Representative, I organized, confirmed, and processed all guest reservations and requests. I verified and adjusted billing. I answered telephones using appropriate etiquette and professional language. I transferred calls and relayed messages between my office and other local businesses within the company. I also sent and received packages and faxes. While gaining extensive experience in office work and data entry, I also gained customer service experience. The central goal of my job was to satisfy the guest and maintain their well being to the best of my ability, while effectively executing behind the scenes office work. Some of the skills I acquired include effective communication, the ability to maintain a professional attitude in extreme situations, data entry, report writing, and problem solving."
good,My manager showed me the in's and out's of the Spa. I learned all management details to run are spa. It was a great place to learn the Spa and Wellness buisness.
good,"It is very diverse, but like some jobs, the management and the guy employee I worked with were horrible. Management needs to do better with that."
good,Serving tables here keeps you on your toes. People that come from all over the world for the tpc players championship are awesome. Making this very a diverse place to work.
good,Be prepared to work. Easy work. But a lot of work. I've been working for Marriott properties put 12 years. Finally took the leap over to corporate Marriott the last 7 months. Wish I would have transferred earlier. Man seniority start over 7 months ago.
good,"A typical day at work was a breeze, most of my shifts were 6-7 hours. I learned how to effectively serve and deliver meals to the guests' rooms. Management was awesome, as they set all of us for success each and every day. The workplace culture was the most fun I've had, especially during special events. The hardest part about the job would have been the busy dinner nights when orders just wouldn't stop coming in. Rewarding, though, don't get me wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job was the respect throughout every department and the weekly paychecks."
good,"The hotel was under renovations while I was working there, so there weren't as many opportunities as I hoped for. But everyone in the hotel treated each other with respect and kindness. Overall great learning experience."
good,I enjoyed working for Marriott. There are a lot of fun and outgoing supervisors to work for. If I had to recommend a friend or family member to the company I would have no problem doing so.

good,"When I start I have to count the money from the boxes, then I make the set up for breakfast, then I make the 5 reports that I do regularly every workday, the hard part of the job is when the credit card scanners stop working for minutes, but in general, everything is satisfactory."
good,"Buenas condiciones laborales y muy buen equipo de trabajo en una empresa innovadora y constante en todas sus servicios. "
good,"Employees were very interactive with each other whether having group meetings or team meetings activities in between breaks to honor or celebrate special events or holidays. employees always kept a positive attitude when dealing with situations on the phones, staff were always willing to help with any questions or concerns when doing one on one meets or coaching sessions as well as using constructive criticism when needed for the employee's to progress and improve, also staff helped with goal setting which each employee for a new month to improve and become a better asset to the company."
good,Enjoyed my time and had success shared with employees and customers on a daily basis. Built and fostered relationships to promote success for all individuals included.
good,The culture is great and the people are even better. The motto of the company is to treat your employees great so they can better serve the customers. This is a true statement all around and although the pay is not necessarily the best in town there are a lot of extra benefits that other companies do not offer. One thing I will say is Marriott has very strict policies that they enforce strongly. They have no problem getting rid of you if you cannot abide by these rules. There is always someone ready to take your job!
good,Great company to work for.  I enjoyed my time there.  There were some aspects of the position that could have been better for work life balance but that is irrelevant now.
good,Tomar en cuenta quiens trabajamos una vez ay y  q x cuestiones personales salimos y qeremos volver
good,Love working with other people and enjoy everything I do. I respect other people. Love smiley and having nice conversations with the guest. Very hard worker
good,Since I have been here I have worked just about every shift except the mid-shift. I absolutely love what I do but I do not get paid enough. I really would like a hiher position like assistant manager or front office manager. Where I am currently working already has someone in those positions so I am seeking something with better pay.
good,Marriott Intl. is a great company to work for. I enjoyed the work atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff and everyone worked together to make everthing to go smooth and perfectly.
good,Great company to work for. Ready for a more challenging position. Great benefits. Always room to grow within the company. Great leadership program. Great work life balance.
good,"Marriott has extremely good benefit and health insurance plan. A lot of challenges and mentor ship are provided here, depend on the property you are working for."
good,Usually I go to work at 11 am. I check guests names and is everything ok . I work hardly and accurately.I communicate very well with all kind of people and try to serve them better than the day before .
good,"Marriott is the ideal company to work for in the hospitality industry. It is a company with incredible core values, benefits, and overall opportunities for growth worldwide."
good,I learned a lot about the hospitality industry. Enjoyed my time working there and everyone there was very friendly. Every department works differently. For instance when i was in AYS your schedule was based on how long you have been in the department. So the  people with seniority would get to pick their days and hours.
good,"I learned a lot from them,some Good and some bad . Learned that  there is no such thing  as job security no matter how you’ve never missed a day or been late  and still end up training your replacement. Overall experience great"
good,Having our hotel familiarization at Marriot Hotel was an amazing experience. Learning about its history and architecture was very inspiring. Being familiar with their rooms and how comfy it is was overwhelming because just ro be inside Marriot is and will always be a great priviledge.
good,"Hardest part of the Job was work life balance.  They work you to the bone with little recognition.  Put in your time and you will go far.  "
good,"The Marriott was a nice workplace environment to be apart of. My regular day at work would consist of sitting down at the receptionist desk, take calls and help people book suites to stay in. Peaceful and nice environment."

good,"Good experience I enjoyed working there.working with Marriott was very pleasant I will be referred any one there"
good,"The Director of Sales was not very professional and managed the department poorly.  That is why I left there.  I loved working for Marriott Hotel, but not in that Sales & Catering Dept."
good,It is a fun place to work.. I enjoy working and meeting people from various places that come to visit. the hardest part of the job is managing your time to get things done on time for future guests. But that isn't  hard at all. Easy job.
good,It was okay the managers was great but some of the co workers was not easy to get along with but overall enjoyed working there. I liked the fast paced work. I also liked that some of the co workers helped you with the rooms it really was team work
good,"nice place, just to far away. i had to uber most days and its 20 bucks one way. but it is a nice place and if you live close to it, it would be a great job to have."
good,"If you need easy weekly cash, great job. If you want to work 100hrs/wk, great job. Low pay. High turnover rates in every position. Hotel discounts ok."
good,Marriott is a good starting place. My managers were understanding and worked around my schedule. Coworkers seemed to only like speaking to the workers they were used to rather than accepting new employees. The pay was not good enough for the amount of work.
good,I love working with them I had discount for motel water view didn't like to ride a bus for 4 hrs other than that I like it housekeeping is good if u like it
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working here. Our general manager and assistant general manager are one of a kind who not only care about our professional lives but personal lives and well being too.

good,One of the best company to grow in career.U can get a very wide exposure & will definately get an opportunity to prove & perform.Very good benefit & perks.
good,Overall the environment was good. The hours were varied so sometimes you may work at 6am or work til midnight. The scheduling made it difficult to plan appointments. Theres some great discounts at other hotels in the network but good luck getting any time off to utilize that benefit.
good,Loved this as my job all through high school and would consider working for their corporate offices in the future. Love their values and corporate culture.
good,"Great captains and co-workers."
good,Marriott International inc is a good place for jobs and advancements. But some ignorant managers can make it difficult 👎....................................
good,"Una empresa altamente calificada, para enseñar y desempeñar y te ayudan a. Crecer laboralmente"
good,"Cleaning folding fixing rooms back to organized structure, I learned that it takes team work to get the job done.The hardest part of the Job was getting the routine down in a orderly fashion, the most enjoyable part, Break time."
good,I think that they were some really good people and we're very hands on with their customers and co workers. Everybody worked as a team and always picked up anybody's slack that wasn't there.
good,Staff is warm and friendly. Never a dull day. Good money for little time. Sometimes stressful but overall easy going. No two days are the same. Good schedule work.
good,Great Opportunity to meet a lot of interesting Guests.  Provides the opportunity to feel accomplished while helping other individuals.  Every day offers a new set of challenges.
good,"I liked working in the call center, everyone there made me feel welcomed. The equipment provide was vey modern day very little technical problems, the cubicles were spacious and comfortable"
good,a typical day at Marriott is coming in warm greetings from management. I have learned alot working there about costumer service and how to talk to guests in a proper manner. Management is good. They try to go above and beyond when they can. The culture is great we have a very diverse group. The hardest part of the job for me is receiving a bad review of a room i had cleaned or refreshed. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting lots of new employees and guests. They really become part of my extended family.
good,"I feel like the general Manager or higher authority set the mood for the work environment, those lack enthusiasm get poor results in employees. everyone should get opportunity to move up."
good,Marriott has some pretty great benefits for the employees. Especially the employee rate for the hotel rooms anywhere in the world. (As long as it is not season.)
good,"Challenging, happy job"
good,"Just keep up, join in and help others, and be on time and you'll have a great time while working. Be respectful and mindful of guests and Co workers and you'll receive the same in return."
good,"A typical day on the job at the Marriott, was help the housekeeper get all their linings to get started for the day. I would empty all trash and sometimes help clean rooms when it was needed. I learned a lot  when I was there, for example dealing with different people who was there in the hotel for different reasons. But the hardest part working there was trying to get on permanent at the hotel. It like I couldn't advance to the next level, because they didn't want to hire on permanent employees."
good,"Working here can either be a very slow paced environment or a very fast paced environment, depending if there's an event or just a regular weekend people want to take for a getaway. Overall we all help each other out from the back to the front of the house."
good,It was an incredible opportunity to help during the most productive quarters of the year  and meeting so many international people blended into the work family at once
good,"I enjoyed working for Courtyard Marriott for these past 3 years this was my first job after being sick for a while; they did alright by me. While working there management did change up but the regular works stayed they same. Even with the change in management, the work ethic was still there and that's who I miss the most the maids and other coworkers that I worked with."
good,"Marriott has a team oriented, customer satisfaction driven organization that provides internal training to teach new employees the Marriott way. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was working with my colleagues and serving the customer."
good,I loved working with my co workers and love the work I do more. It's not a rush to get your work done because the rooms are bigger than your basic hotel rooms. Your given 45-1hr to do your room. So you have the time to properly clean and replenish.
good,"Marriott is an exciting work place where I enjoy the company of guest. It provides free lunch and the moment an employee is not feeling okay it is extremely important to notify a supervisor\manager. The hotel is a friendly environment where people can meet new people and offers guest numerous events. For example, the hotel contained live music, bar, a pool with a water slide and a restaurant."
good,loved working here but just the timing was off for me. i have 2 kids and it's like you have to dedicate you live to the hotel. there were times i was there from 8am to 9pm at time sometimes longer.
good,"Good environment , you can learn a lot , good money depend where you work , management salary is low, company have good benefits , a lot opportunity too grow"

good,"I love to work for Marriott but the managers i worked with was discrimination, favoristism, n poor at management. They hired more hispanics than other race. Few peoples have left that company due to favoristism, and not getting hrs or days to work. They treated me unfair cuz im Deaf."
good,"Great company, but some of their management was not professional in their duties. Being promise positions and then being told someone else was chosen, after you were not given ample time to complete the on the job training."
good,its a nice place to work for n a lot of team work n a nice staff n everyone help out each other n the chef is a great cook n great leader I really learned a lot I started out in the dish room n worked my way up to a lead cook

good,Overall the Marriott is wonderful place to work. You encounter so many different people and cultures and learn so much. When I first started at this location it was the Sheraton. We have had different management in different areas but the HR department and other individuals have made the transition as easy as possible. As always I am always eager to learn. This place provides opportunities for advancement and this IS a wonderful place to explore!

good,New York Laguardia was a great company until Aimbridge Hospitality bought it. They took away all the great things about working for Marriott. Hotel is currently closed for rennovations
good,"Ambiente comodo, muchos beneficios para el empleado"
good,being a receptionist was fun but very difficult at times! it was A lot going on all the time (in a good way). I feel like the job that the receptionist took on was  A lot for the pay that they gave us.

It was fun running into a lot of the colts players when they would stay at the hotel during home games.
good,Working at the Courtyard marriott has taught me many things about myself and how to best relate to other people. While sometimes frustrating there is nothing like the rush of serving a bunch of football fanatics during the homegames.

She allowed it for one night only, and the  dog had to be with someone at all time.  Well I actually got the best letter written  by the owner but making it believe it was the dog Dante writing it. It actually made me cry."

While training and leading a team I have always endeavoured to pass on these values to other staff members."
good,"I started work for Marriott in 2007 and loved it"
good,"I worked at the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Orange Beach AL. My job was to do the hotel laundry (cleaning all the sheets, towels, blankets for the guests). It doesn't sound very glamorous, but, this was by far my favorite job. Marriott is such a good company, every morning they have what we called ""huddle"" and it is just a was that they start the day, they would recognize birthdays, have a pep talk, discuss the daily agenda, etc. Everybody seemed to hate it most days, but honestly I think it was a key part of making each day work and I think more companies should have some program like this. "
good,"Great company to work for normaly My job was assist the Front Office Manager in the efficient running of the Front Office department by understanding the day to day running of the Front Desk, Guest Service Centre, Concierge Desk, Guest Relations and Business Centre.

I was able and could work first and second shift and has always felt and believe it was necessary to learn both shifts. Cleanness and organization was always something I thrived on to keep me and co-workers happy along with customers happy with an speedy check in and check out process. I worked for the best management team who was very hands on and was never afraid to step in and get their hands dirty to get the job done. Although it was challenging when working alone and having to do maintenance housekeeping and run the front desk… The most enjoyable part of my job was hearing the guest say how wonderful there stay was, then reading about it in the comments."
good,Starwood provided lots of training and development plans for associates.  Starwood Job Security is there with growth as well.
good,Me gusto mucho este empleo debido a que siempre te estan invitando a cursos tanto de formacion laboral como personal y eso hace que cada ves seas mejor persona.
good,"Soon as you walk through the doors, you'll be greeted by a friendly front desk staff or manager. That's how I usually start my day off. It was either followed up by a guest request or a humorous story. The atmosphere was loose and comedic at times but you always had to take care of business. Many personalities, all friendly and caring. Like life, not everything goes as plan, and their will be a time when you got to deal with some adversity, but when it comes down to it, everyone is willing to help to get the job done. In my role, it was hard to find the balance with work and personal time. Being on call 24/7 has major drawbacks. The staff tries to control it but sometimes it's inevitable to be called in, sometimes at very late hours. Overall, it was a great experience, great team members, and you might come away with a cool nickname or a terrible one, but it's always funny."
good,"Hotel marriot is a 5 star hotel in pakistan."

good,"Wat bekend is vooraf een dienst begint is de begintijd, en eventuele reserveringsaantal, geboekte partijen, etc. Verder speelt het geheel zich vooral af op het moment zelf. Goede communicatie en samenwerking tussen collega's is van groot belang, dit wordt ook teruggezien in goede resultaten die in dit 5-sterrenhotel worden behaald. De gasten lopen uiteen van koffiedrinkers tot presidenten of staatshoofden, een uitstekende service is erg belangrijk. De meeste collega's hebben de hotelschool afgerond of doen die momenteel, ikzelf ben een uitzondering met mijn huidige opleiding Chemische Technologie. Er heerst een algemene gemoedelijke sfeer op de werkvloer. In de 3 jaar tijd dat ik hier werk heb ik geen conflicten tussen collega's meegemaakt. Wat het werk soms moeilijk maakt is dat onder hoge druk (bezetting, vraag) dezelfde hoge kwaliteit in service behouden moet worden. Wat het werk leuk maakt is dat ik mijn werk/moeite direct terug kan zien bij de gasten; hoe meer tevreden ze zijn, hoe meer voldaan ik ben. De directie is zeer positief betrokken bij het personeel, zo worden er regelmatig trainingen gegeven om de kennis en alertheid altijd actueel te houden. Er is een algemene hoge discipline op de werkvloer. Tot nu toe is dit de prettigste plek waar ik heb gewerkt."
good,"meet new people everyday, 2 dollar lunch, free coffee."
good,Always came to work with a smile on my face. A really fun atmosohere with great people.
good,A typical day at work represented a challenge because of the french culture. Anyways I learned to be better in my job and also learned to love what I did. I still have good friends I found in this job.
good,"Open door policy, room to grow. Great benefits, innovative spirit. Hands on learning, co-workers were fun. Hardest part of my job was telling people they didn't make it into a program. Best part of the job was working with great people."
good,"This job was a fantastic job that allowed me to grow and learn something new everyday. I interacted with customers from all walks of life, helped them to make reservations, or simply talked to the ones who called out of sheer loneliness; managing to help them make a reservation with us in the end. Learned so much that I became an on the job trainer within months and trained new employees in the field. The hardest part was handling the calls that came in that weren't so nice but I always maintained composure and kept that smile on my face. The most enjoyable was making someone's day and them thanking me for being so nice and patient with them throughout the call."
good,"Extended stay hotel in the houston Medical center.  Great property, management very supportive and positive.  Really showed staff that they were appriciated.  Great work place co workers were like family."

good,been working for a subsidary marriott company for the last 3 years; Been really good but there's been some challenges too.
good,The Bistro is excellent. On holidays they offer gift cards to employees to show appreciation. They are always trying to progress in hospitality industry. My co-workers were like family. We may argue and joke. But at the end of the day we came together to get the job done.
good,"A typical day at work is of course greeting guest, getting your work assigned, and completing it at a decent time. I've learned to be a team player, I became better at multitasking. My co-workers are very pleasant company to be around, very positive energetic people, like myself. The hardest part of the job is having lots of work to do, while being short staffed. It makes the day harder and longer, but teamwork is a plus so we manage to get by. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know guest personally. You soon learn their names, their pet names and they begin to feel like family. Also, getting good feedback, getting all 5 stars and  having your name mentioned in a guests' survey."
good,"I loved working with clients in a relaxing environment, taking care of their concerns and needs, above all making them feel nurtured. "
good,I always looked forward to morning huddles on the weekdays. During huddle we would go over our occupancy for the day and any special accommodations we needed to prepare for our guest. I learned so from my coworkers as well as the guest. My experiences with Residence Inn have made me break out of my shell. Management always had their doors open and ready to hear any problems or suggestions we had. My coworkers became a second family for me. We all cared for each other and everyone's well being. I really did love working for Residence Inn by Marriott.
good,"People here (especially the managers) are treating everyone equally, too bad there are few haughty frost desks who don't want to mingle with the lower caste, they think they're in upper level."

good,Everybody that was coworker made the hotel experience very fun and made work enjoyable to come too.
good,"Dealing with guests every day."
good,"My day consisted of scheduling, ordering alcohol and meeting with management to set up a plan of action to reach our departments goals.  Our management team was very experienced and always willing to help each department manager out to overcome challenges.  The hardest part of my job was delegating out tasks to my supervisors and trusting that they would get it accomplished.  On the other hand I learned so much as a manager and how to grow as a person."

good,Job was OK just hard to move up within the company due to seniority . The longer you work there not depending how good you are the more opportunities you get.The management was good and the benefits as well. Pay was good but hard to get a raise.
good,My work was varied and I was given a free hand in how I managed my day.
good,Typical day at work  for me is jus working cleaning rooms. What I have learned on my job is how to have patience. Management and co workers are very reliable the hardest part of my job is sometimes it can be stressul but it all pays off for the most enjoyable part of the day and that is satisfying my guest.

good,this is one of my favorite jobs excellent place and staff was simply amazing
good,"There is a lot written about ways to make the work place more fun, and there is something to that, but more important is for workers to feel they are doing useful and important work. Often, as workers remain with the company, more and more administrative stuff creeps into their work load. Tracking progress, generating reports, and keeping statistics are important to the company, and fortunately there are people who enjoy doing that part of the work. For many workers, however, these tasks fall into the category of “mickeymouse”, and get in the way of doing the jobs they really enjoy, like helping clients and generating profit for the company"
good,"I would arrive in the morning and go to the restaurant to help close them down and begin prepping for the next day.  I then would g to the front desk and give the representative her lunch break.  I would then begin forecasting sheets, updating charts and taking the beverage inventory before the evening team came in to open the restaurant.  I went back to my office to answer e-mails and voice mails.  Then I would be present at the restaurant and front desk to jump in and help if needed.  "
good,"The job is very nice. Gives me a lot of space to prove what I have learnt and gained as experience so far as well as improve and develop my knowledge. I am grateful to work with the company as they have thought me a great number of skills. However I think I should already find a more challenging place where I could manage more people and resources as well as implement what I have learnt during the last two years with the current company.

good,"The days consist of the same thing each day cleaning rooms/ laundry. I learned to become more organized about my work place/space. i enjoyed working as a team that was hard working. I would have to say the hardest part of the job would have been when we had over booked rooms and needed to have rooms clean right after first guest checked out to allow for our next guest to check in and still maintain the other rooms we had for the day, as we always made it work out. Our managers always made us feel as we were part of the hotel and like family."

When the lost item is found its like it was never missing."

I learned lots about customer service through my supervisors and team mates, spoke to people world wide, our manager  was awesome, you could not ask for better team mates they became like my second family...the hardest part of my job was not being able to meet 100% of the customers needs or wants 100% of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was not only my co-workers but the customers were fun to work with and the incentives were awesome."

good,"I have been very proud to work for Marriott.  I have met some great people, not only the staff, but some terrific guests as well. These guests come from all different companies from all over the world.  I helped open the new hotel in Spartanburg and it was a wonderful experience.  I was instrumental helping out with events and charities held by large companies meeting with and helping out top key people to make sure everything ran smoothly and that everyone was having a good time.

I like the business model of Marriott. Bill Marriott speaks of ""The Spirit to Serve,"" which by the way, is the title of a book that he wrote. What I like most about Marriott is, their approach to business. "
good,"Check guest in and out, Help with the needs of the guest. I really don't care for Interstate management company. Im not to thrilled with the annual raises/evaluations."
good,"A typical day at work involves assisting guests with questions or problems they may have, cleaning the lobby when it needs it, answering phone calls, making reservations and looking and acting professional. The hardest part about this job is they are open 24/7 so you have to be available to work on weekends and nights. One of the best things is that you meet a lot of cool and friendly people."

good,arriving to every shift was always great seeing everyone i worked with and working as a team to prep for dinner. After the company fired the original manager it took them almost a year to hire a new one. I really enjoyed meeting all the new guests that would come everyday and getting to know them. Making sure their stay was the best they couldve gotten.
good,"Mornings started with cheerfull hello's from coworkers and on to breakfast prep. As a morning server it is important to set the mood for customers. My interaction with them sets the positive momentum for their day. My coworkers were very team oriented and helpful. Management varied from time to time, some better at their jobs than others. My focus was guest satisfaction and completion of tasks assigned to me. The hardest part of the job would have been the shortage in equipment. The best part of job was seeing satisfaction on my guest face from the service I provided. Also, I said coworkers before but I really enjoyed working with me friends."

My typical day at work icluded constructing work boards, inspecting rooms as well as puBLIC areas and assisting my manager in daily activities.I learned a lot of new things at the pere marquette. I learned how to schedule employees, purchase products for the department and handle guest related issue. The hardest part of my job was makking sure we had most room vacant ready by 3pm which was check in time. This part of my job was a mission everyday. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with a diverse culture of people. I learned new things everyday from the housekeepers overall. However, I really enjoyed learning new skills."

good,"I was an @home reservationist with the option of being able to come into the office to work from their computers. I answered the phone every morning at 10am until 6:30 pm. Having my own system and having to log into their network was a pain given the fact it would slow me down pretty bad. But what I loved about my job here was they, my supervisor, were always on top of how I could improve myself to better the experience for the customers and for the company. They were upbeat, chill, yet so very mature and goal oriented. There were always goals that were set for me to work towards and every time I met that goal I was rewarded with positive feedback and just all around positivity. Though that is good, it was still frustrating! But, I still loved that job. I just enjoyed helping people and knowing that I aided in their selection of the hotel they stayed at (the guests that called in) and it put a smile on my face to know I was making a difference just by smiling over the phone (which is possible) and giving a warm experience. Management was a bit hectic, though. Seemed like if anything needed organizing it would be management.I didn't really have ""co-workers"" since I worked from home. The hardest part was having to sell all the time. I was good at it, but it was hard because I hated having to push for sales. Kind of ironic given that the whole company is about selling hotel rooms."
good,"I only worked there for a few months it was a seasonal job, but i loved it. Great work place, great work environment, great co-workers, just a great place to work im sad it was only a seasonal job."
good,Get to your station get started on your work. New poeple great work enviroment. Management was open door and it felt comfortable.

good,I would suggest that you make sure you express the need for work/life balance when starting to make sure it's understood that your sanity and family come first. It's easier for your manager to deal with scheduling if they know what type of dedication they are working with.
good,This  company had room for advancement and was considerate of my work and home life balance. Great benefits and raises as well. This company also encourages you to give back to the community.

good,My last position was night auditor which was one of the most challenging jobs in the company but I managed to run not only my hotel but two more. I’m very reliable and when it comes to work/paperwork whatever it may be I like to be as proficient as possible.
good,"Although I wasn't here for very long I loved my time working and would like to take green keeping up as a career. at work I would start 5.30 am, everyone had different jobs everyday, so you get your equipment you need and get on with it. I learned how to use machinery different chemicals grass needs and lots more, The management was good but had room for improvement. The hardest part of work would be raking bunkers as there are so many and if its raining the sand can be harder to rake and if its sunny you get all hot and bothered, the most enjoyable part was working out doors, I loved the environment and was rewarding to see your work once finished."

I learned how to prepare and set up for an even on my own. I got to know/meet  ppl from all over  the world. Everyone in there help each other, there is a great teamwork role.  The management really seem to know what they are doing and have everything in place, set and ready to go for an event. The hardest thing about working there for me was when the slow season was here and only the full timers  employees that have been there for years get to work, and the part timers and on-call employees work less or nothing sometimes per week. For this reason I had to leave marriott and find me another job. But overall it was a great experienced working for the Marriott Hotel."

good,Working at any Marriott hotel will help you gain the amount of experience and knowledge that you need in the hospitality/customer service industry. The hardest part of the job is learning how manage to multi-task with your work duties while assisting and dealing with guests. It helps train your brain to focus and concentrate under pressure.

good,"7 am-3pm public area/housekeeping. you do pre shift to know what is going on through the day. then you get your section prepare for the day to clean. the work culture is very diverse. the hardest of the job when it is really buys and your partner is lackinng and you dont have much help. most enjoyably of the job is meeting and seeing all these different kind of people. it could be famous people, as a example the public area 11pm-7am. overnihgt. you are more independent and make decisions on your own. you get to improve your leadership skills  you are sometimes there by yourself. you are in charge of the guess rooms and the public ares and take care of the guess needs. you have to helped out the front desk with their runs to deliver items to the guest rooms. you have to finish the projects and be proactive. you have to have good time maganment when oyu work overnight. you have to complete your check list so the other shift is prepare for the next moirng. the hardest part of the job is when you are new to the overnight shift you dont get alot of training on how to change the sheets onn the room, get a fridge, and other important jobs that deal with the guest rooms. you have to inspected the guest rooms and make sure the are prefect. so you have to speak to your manager that you need more traing on the guests rooms because there is not a enough calls durring the night to deal with the guests rooms."

During the day with the various events that may happen always brings the building alive minus the random pipe burst or wild guest marriott is a great company to be apart of
good,"This is a hospitality job, which means your job security and image in the eyes of management is directly correlated to how the guests feel about you.

good,My main problem was the front desk computer program for checking guest in and out.  The payment set up got confusing for me.  I could do the night audit because that program was consistent and anyone could do it if they can add and subtract.  There was just something about the other program that confused me when the screens changed.
good,It's a good environment it's a hotel it's up and down but when it is good it is good.Ok we cook for the Philadelphia eagles. Nothing is better than that
good,"I come in clock in and start my work. I first have to understand my duties and what things i need to serve or prepare. What ever the manager says to do, is my duty."
good,the kitchen is very faced paced which usually makes for a high turn over rate as workers who cannot keep up leave sooner. This then opens up the floor for fast paced workers to advance to other stations. Kitchen has fantastic team work and family dynamic.
good,I had a wonderful experience while at marriott. I have no complaints. the mobile team was informed and talented and we were given latitude to work toward a better consumer experience that in turn satisfied the business goals.
good,"I went to my local Marriott hotel for a co op in hotel management, I always wanted to know more about hotels. The biggest thing about the one i went to was the managers were really great people."
good,I really enjoy working at this establishment.  I just wasn't able to get many hours per week.  I really need a job where I can get at least 8 hours a day.  I learned how to clean rooms efficiently and how to do laundry in a quick manner.  The workplace culture was very friendly and the workers taught how to be clean and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was not being allowed to get hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendliness of the coworkers and management.
good,"I love working at the Marriott Hotel, although the General manager was not professional at all, and that gave the employees body a very weak leadership model."
good,I have learned many invaluable skills at Fairfield and I am happy that I have had the opportunity to work there. The management makes it known how much your efforts are appreciated every day. I began before the hotel was even open and I am proud of the building and all of the success we have enjoyed. The managers are very supportive and want nothing but to see everyone succeed in their position. The only downfall with this job is the pay but sometimes you have to decide whats important.
good,Positive work atmosphere great staff. I worked here a few short months but we had company parties near holidays. Never a time where I didnt have enough supplies to perform my job
good,"Having worked in two locations (South Portland: Sable Oaks and Peabody Marriott), I was fortunate to work for the best managers and staff. We truly felt like a family and worked well as a team in both locations."
good,"If you like being on the phone then this is a job for you. You must be aware of a program called PURE which is a reservation program. Sometimes you get nasty customers, but who doesn't. Management is very helpful and kind. No commission from your sales."
good,The Starwood company chain is for sure among one of the best jobs iv had in my history of work and would always concider working for them agin. no complaints
good,The Marriott is a very easy going but steady job. They have public transportation to get you to and from work. They provide free lunch and breakfast to all workers.
good,"Every place I have worked within Marriott International has been a hardworking, fun loving team that feels like family.  Long hours, not always a work life balance, but we enjoyed working together for the common goal."
good,Managing the transition between management and the clients. Supporting the customer needs with the integrity of the company. The company gives an individual the opportunity to explore their ideas along with inputting them.
good,I really enjoyed working or this company. I was with the company for almost 15 years. I have met a lot of nice people through this company. I loved working in a team setting
good,"everyday for me is a new learning day and also to teach people also. taking care of people and motivating them and growing has always been my focus, delivering of quality without compensating standards and morals."
good,Mariott gave me a chance to show my work ethic and appreciated the work that I did for the company.  They always were trying to provide as many hours as they were able to.
good,"I was working for starwood hotels before they merged with the marriott and When it was Starwod I enjoyed the job with every fiber of my being i couldn't wait to go to work. When they Merged with Marriott it downhill from there, so I moved on."
good,"Social work hours, with good team mates. It wasn't without its challenges but employees were always in a position to tackle the challenges. Very welcoming of their trainees."
good,Over all for this company my review will be this is a great company to work for. Especially if you need experience in housekeeping/hisptialy. To work in the bigger hotels and bigger establishment.
good,"great people, great team, Every country in the world has a hospitality industry, and the skills you learn here are readily transferable, meaning that a career in hospitality can very easily be the key to discovering new countries, new culture and new people."
good,"Working for Marriott may have been the best I had considering it was in my field of study. I had a great time and met many people of which I still stay in contact with. Would love to go back however, life has different things in store for me."
good,I enjoy making guest for life the experience that I have for the last 16 years.  Captain's management or the importance of my job each server responsible for every task.
good,The typical day there would be all of us meeting in the break room to see what rooms we had and a estimate time on when we should be done. We would go up and stock our carts with what we needed and then started our day cleaning and greeting the guests. I learned almost everything I know about housekeeping there. They had great supervisors and an amazing staff. Everyone worked together and were very friendly. The most enjoyable part about Townplace suites was that we all worked together and helped each other if needed. Hardest part of the job was if we had a lot of check outs and trying to get things done at the right time.
good,Management were bad they didnot know what they were doin. Breaking the rules for some people . It was a very bad divide enviroment. The early years were great. But the later years were awful. All the people they bring the didnot know what 2 do.
good,"I love meeting new people. We have guests from all over the World and most are here for positive, fun, relaxing times. Although it is sometimes slow there are usually things to do and people to talk to. The staff is friendly and helpful and the manager will go out of her way to take care of her staff."
good,"I spent a total of over twenty two years at Marriott and it's the people and the owner that made me feel as if I had a place and a purpose. My department worked as a team. We were there for each other on good projects and bad. If one person had a problem, we all had a problem. And together, we could solve any problem that we faced. I was honored to work for Marriott and I have a great deal of respect for the owners and the people. The hardest part of my job was leaving it. The most enjoyable part, was the opportunities to work on many different projects all over the world."
good,"Working at the Mystic Marroitt was a great time with mostly friendly and great people to work with that act like a family. steady to busy during the spring, summer and fall times of the year."

good,Assisting guest with various needs on a daily basis.  Very busy at times but good work environment.  Met a lot of great people on the job there.  Made a lot of great friends.
good,"I have really enjoyed my time working at Protea Hotel by Marriott Cape town North Wharf, the work environment is excellent however I feel that it is time for me to take a different route outside of hospitality. As is the case with all jobs there are ups and downs, ups being that I get to meet and acquire new guests everyday and no two days are ever the same, downs being the shifts - you never get to see your family. I am very family orientated so I am looking for something that only requires me to work weekdays and maybe alternate Saturdays."
good,My overall experience at this hotel was an learning obstacle for both myself and my co workers. I feel That the Mariott was a place for growth and they treated their employees very well . There benefits were outstanding and my managers were also very helpful. I felt i was a wonderful asset to the company and i think that if i can return back to the Mariott hotel I think I would.
good,checked in guest answered call for reservations and any other needs of the hotel i would be happy to do. g.m is very understanding and intuned at her work
good,"A typical day that I would have, I would get to work, log into my computer and get myself ready for the calls to come in. I would meet with my supervisor and find out what hotels I would be taking calls for or I would just talk to her to discuss any calls she or I had questions about."
good,"i am working as Duty Engineer/Ruining department as a department head attend HOD morning briefing to discuss about business and operation issue."
good,"We put together important business meetings, special events, weddings etc.  I learned how to be an excellent leader and read layout plans.  Everyone in there designated department works as a team.  There was nothing hard about this job and it was easy to move setting up from one event to another."
good,"Great place to work. Can work in different departments aside from your own for extra income. Management although great, seriously lack humility. Co-workers always look out for each other. Great benefits. The company expects to be placed first as a life priority."
good,"I have enjoyed my time as a restaurant GM . My pay is not what I would like, but the leadership is awesome and I feel supported. Very structured and a nice benefit package are the HR aspects. The staff itself is programmed and culturally sound, aspects of this are Integrity"

good,There are so many positions you can choose from all over the world.  Unlimited overtime!  Hotel visitors come from all over.  Unlimited opportunities.
good,This is my first job right after graduation. This is the first place where I learned everything and experience the real world. The managers are so kind and helpful even the general manager of the hotel will appreciate your work and give you some advice or words to make you even more productive. The hardest part of the job is long working hours this is where I experienced to have a duty 18 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is to witness some cool events and serve some artist or famous people even the President of the country and we keep the fun while working.
good,"The Hotel is a family, every body works hard to make sure the guest has the best experience. The hours are good, always 40 hours and OT is granted as necessary. Got wonderful benefits and their was a staff cafeteria to go for breaks and have a meal."

good,"A typical day would consist of checking guests in and out. Communicating with housekeeping about what rooms are vacant,answering phones, making fresh coffee, running reports. Management was good to the employees, within a few weeks of working I was offered full time with a dollar pay raise. The hardest part would be knowing how and when to answer the phones, and talk to a guest in person, you don't want the phone to keep ringing, but you don't want the guest in front of you to feel neglected. The best part of the job would be getting to talk with guests about their day."

I've learned much about other countries, their habits, ideals, and views of America. I've had many opportunities to educate travelers about this wondrous city of Florence. I've learned much about etiquette, fine dining, running a restaurant of such a high caliber, and honing my customer service skills."
good,"Great job! Compensation could've been slightly better, and communication between departments was really ineffective, seemingly nonexistent. Also, HR department was terrible. They never had the correct information off hand."
good,"Management was very involved and training was given regularly to achieve the combined goals of running the business smoothly."
good,It is a big hotel with huge mumber of inventory. Good place to innovate yourself. Trainings and learnings are given best priorities in this hotel. One can enjoy work with great fun.

I learned from different people how to use my creative and how to handle my knife. I enjoyed the team meeting it was fun going out with the people you work with and get closer as a team.
good,It was a great place to work.  Standards of procedures were clarified to us the employees.  We followed this procedures and were able to do as we were told.
good,"This was a great experience for learning customer service skills. I saw a wide range of guest from the age of 1 to 100 years old. It was a stressful job when the hotel was full. Customer service is key, no matter what a guest is always right and Marriott always made a point to see a happy guest. Sometimes we would run out of supplies and people would call out which would make our job a little hectic. Team work was key for my boss."
good,"Busy environment, fast pace and demanding, stressful some times, Work demands open availability and weekend work is a must.  Steady work and benefits are a plus."

The management was top of the line. They were all very involved with all associates from every department and always kept a positive attitude.

It is very easy to lose track of time with the number of responsibilities you have in order to keep basic operations afloat. You frequently have to step out of your positions role to fulfill another one temporarily. It is very exhausting, however, as you will be working many overtime hours including overnight shifts. You can expect to work 16+ hour days. This leaves little room to engage in your life outside of work."

good,"Marriott is a great company to build a long-career.  If you work hard and embrace the culture and corporate priorities, you will generally be rewarded with recognition and growth opportunities."
good,"Working at Marriott International will definitely increase your knowledge of more than a few things, whether you are seeking that knowledge or not.  I do however, find that intriguing and very useful in the long run.  Management encourages moving around the company to find your niche. The opportunity to learn new things in various departments is the norm in the Marriott culture.  The hardest part I would say is when you are just not interested in learning the task set before you because that is not what you applied for.  The most enjoyable part is and always has been for me with any job/career is serving people.  The appreciation, gratitude and pure happiness you can bring a person is priceless."

good,"Fue la primera vez trabajando en el departamento de eventos y convenciones de un hotel de tan renombre y tamaño. Cada día era un día diferente, nunca se hacia aburrido. Fue un trabajo muy satisfactorio ya que cada vez que superaba un ""challenge"" me parecia que todo era posible. Aprendí a organizarme mejor, a trabajar en equipo, a delegar responsabilidades y a recibir mas también. La mejor parte del trabajo eran los compañeros y los jefes, siempre dando la oportunidad de aprender más siempre haciendote sentir respetado, imprescindible y como en família. Lo más difícil del trabajo fueron los momentos previos a superar los ""challenges"" de los clientes, y por lo contrario, la que más me gustó fue una vez superados."

The management was ok I just didn't like the fact that I had managers that had no skills in their department to understand the pros and cons of the job.

Was they fired? no suspended? No... But I could have been.. Not all hotels do this and not all Marriots do this but if a person has been there for 2 to 3 years and you have been there for 1 year then it means they will not be judged by the same standards even if they was in the wrong. Pretty messed up, I dont like it, and I dont agree with it. But I respect it. Anyway with that kind of system sooner or later I would be set up again so I did the only thing I could..I left. Thankfully I picked up another Marriot job and it was awesome as it should of been the first time...  of course in another state.. seems like in my experience pensacola just has bad job practices...I am glad I left, born and raised be dam---(you get it.). >.>"

Room for advancement in Marriot all depends on how far one wishes to grow.  Many opportunities exist to advance as well as learning other departments if one is interested.  And of course,  one is not limited as to a particular area of the country to work.  One may wish to work on the east coast and then may decide to work on the west coast a year or two later?

good,"I really enjoyed this job because it came with a lot of freedom.  As one of the bellhops to Irvine's full-service Marriott we had a lot of responsibility.  We were expected to full fill a typical bellhop's duties while also acting as concierge service, shuttle service (both to/from John Wayne and acted as courtesy shuttle for guest), runners (take things to guest rooms, excluding room service food but not drinks).  A typical day would include either constant shuttle runs (2/hr to John Wayne) with a handful of bellhop tasks to be carried out in between (5-7mins between trips).  Some days I would be the only person a guest would interact with; I would pick them up from the airport check them in (I got bored on a slow day and learned the front desk's position's work), take their luggage to them (and any request they had for the room I would have to prepare), then if they needed anything else to accommodate their stay I would bring it to them.  They would later come down to me and ask where to eat or what to do and I would give them a handful of choices based on what they interested in and my personal recommendation.  Then if the place was close enough I would personally drive them there and leave them with my name and the hotel's number to have me pick them up.  In between my tasks I was free to walk around and help guests and co-workers out.  Management did not have much interaction with me unless it was to point out an important guest and to make sure we knew of any preferences they had.  My co-workers were all fun and professional.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with"
good,"I started as a server, went to task force (opening new restaurants), then became the district trainer, did cashier and customer service, and management. I learned every aspect of full service dining. Management had a fast turnover. Co-workers were awesome, team spirit was how we were abe to deal with all the management turnover. The hardest part of the job was new mangement every 2-3 months. The most enjoyable part of the job was regular customer and co-worker family!"

I learned so much at being from the Marriott. I learned many techniques of greeting guests and making eye contact with them. I learned how to control a situation using empathy statements and getting the guest taken care of to the best of my ability. The management team were AWESOME! Everyone got along with each other as one big family. We all helped each other out. The hardest part of my job was either telling a guest they made reservations at another hotel and sending them on their way or telling the guest that we were sold out of rooms and had to walk them to a different hotel although they had reservations with us. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and making relationships with the guests."

good,"Honestly I get tired of jobs easily but I never got tired of this one! The only downsides are that your shifts are  8 hours and youre standing the entire time (invest in some good shoes) AND raises are only around .25 every June unless you're promoted. Advancement opportunity is honestly the best there is and I wouldn't want to leave unless I have good reason to (hired at a better paying job in my case) BUT, it is decent pay!

The hardest part is not being able to satisfy all guest needs. Different brands offer different amenities. But guest appreciation makes it a rewarding experience, as well as company discounts."
good,I enjoy starting my work day early and having the opportunity to be one of the first bright faces that guests see in the morning. The work atmosphere itself is very upbeat and casual. The most difficult part of the job would be balancing both the front of the house and the back of the house duties when understaffed.
good,"Fun place to work "
good,working in the kitchen of the world center Marriott is one of the best. it's a diverse group of people who showcases their talents and shares their culture with others. you can learn a lot specially when it comes to food because of diversity.

good,Great Company to work for. Proud working for the biggest hotel company in the world. Leadership provides clear guidelines were we as a team and company are heading to become even a better company
good,"I worked 8 hours each day. I would take the first 30 minutes to set everything up, turn on all equipment and count the drawer. I would then be greeted by several customers waiting to place an order. I worked at a very fast pace fulfilling their orders until every customer waiting was taken care of. After that for the most part it was very steady and at a easy pace for me. But some days such as when sports teams would stay there it would become very hectic being the only employee working. Luckily though previous experience had prepared me for large groups of people and I never really ran into any issue. It was a very fun job. I loved meeting and getting to interact with the guest staying there."

They have a brand new building with a big, comfortable lounge, beautiful views of the mountains, many places to sit, etc. However this job requires that you are good with people, have good computer knowledge, and strict time management.

good,"The culture at Marriott is what makes it an awesome place to work. Every company has their cons, but Marriott's management tried to make sure those cons were less felt by the employees. The position I was in stayed very busy. The con that I experienced was on the business side (law or risk management) of Marriott, the administrative staff didn't have much openness to really grow, where as on the Marketing and research side of Marriott, the administrative staff received all of the benefits to assist their department in total functionality. Example, the administrative staff in certain departments were not privy to laptops and working from home as an option, but in other departments, the administrative staff was given those options as well as other options and it made the department run more effectively and built moral within the administrative staff. Management in every department was very different."

We all need some changes to find our self more responsible in doing new things and grow more. I am currently working in Marriott company where i have started in here since 2006. WE have good management where they've been very helpful in all staff and most off all they are there to help you what matters most. The most enjoyable i had in here is working with passion and my manager is always there to help us and treat us fair in many ways.
good,"Top employer for industry with culture of taking care of hosts, guests and community. Foundations of leadership and development of managers based on attainable goals."
good,Asked what makes the Ritz Carlton the best--the answer is truly its people. And that starts by hiring the right Associates. Constant training creates pride in all.
good,"Working at the JW Marriott in Austin was a tremendous experience. I was able excel and adapt to different situations and gain more knowledge to better my career and future careers. My management team was open and willing to help with whatever needed to be done even if it meant they had to step in and help out. Not only was my team great, but I always felt welcomed in any department if I had to go to them with questions or concerns. The hardest part of my job was working in a fast paced environment and having to maintain  great customer service as well as a vast knowledge of our cocktails, wines, beers, and liquors. I will never forget my coworkers who were always there to help out with any questions one would have and always being friendly."

good,"Nice Team Work"
good,I worked at the Sheraton for almost 4 years. It is a nice place to work the employees are great everyone in every department gets along great. The management is nice but will happily throw you under the bus if need be to save there own butt. The people on my team were amazing it is part of the reason i stayed so long. One thing you need to understand at that hotel is that there are lots of people who have been there 20+ years and they are not going anywhere so don't expect to move up in seniority any time soon or at least very quickly. In all my time there I moved one spot and was still part time throughout my whole time there.

I very much enjoyed working with the clerks at the service desk. Loved having a duty list to work from, permitted me to manage my time effectively, leaving open time for breaks and emergencies."
good,"I worked for Starwood for a little over 3 years and really enjoyed working there; however I am looking for a little more routine schedule now that I am married and preparing to start a family. Every hotel is different (I worked for 3) and every role is different, but the open 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, even holidays mindset is everywhere... and I am looking for something different."
good,"As an event manager one is responsible for the complete planning of large conventions to smaller board meetings or local social events.  It is a self driven job where I work at my own pace but ultimately responsible to make sure my work is done in plenty of time to communicate the needs of the client to the operational parts of the resort. Plenty of hands on communication with other departments to insure that the program runs as planned when the clients are on-site. Requires constant communication with the client in pre-planning and when on-site. So working weekends is part of the job. But one gets a great deal of satisfaction knowing a job well done at the end of the program. Much of the day is spent at a computer completing  the required paperwork, sending E-mails or having phone contact with the clients. But the job also allows movement away from the desk to check on clients or converse with other departments. The hardest part of the job is the stress of being perfect, not only in myself but making sure others know what is expected of them. Best part is the friendships and trust building that occurs with working with clients for several months and then seeing the end result of that planning."
good,"Handling customers needs and complaints empowered by supportive management was made easy. Management was very organized and made this work place safe, fun, and respectful."

The management were some of the best people I have ever worked for.  Very kind caring and professional.  All the co workers got along very well.  Even co workers from the other departments got along well.  Our number one goal was to satisfying the guest.  The hardest part of the job was the banquettes.

My day to day experience consisted of checking in and out DVDs and various hardware to students, as well as always being available to answer any questions. If I didn't know the answer, I was always encouraged to ask a higher-up or even Google it. I learned so much about the library that I never knew prior to working there, even though I had been a student at the U for about two years before I became a part of the staff. It's difficult to pinpoint the best part of the job, since it was extremely rewarding all around. My managers were incredibly helpful and friendly, and I was free to do my schoolwork whenever there was downtime. My co-workers were always willing to cover any shifts, even on relatively short notice, and communication was easy."
good,"My coworkers where the best part of my day, we had fun and we worked very hard. The only real complaint I had about the job was the scheduling. There would be nights that are always busy and just one person. Which wouldn't be to big of a deal if we were talking about a smaller business. When we are talking about a hotel that means, typically, over 100 rooms (138 at the hotel I was employed at) that you have to check in, run items to room, fix any mistakes...etc. It's very hard to make everyone happy, especially if there is a rush. Other then that, I loved my hotel."

good,Productive and fun workplace and not stressful at all. I work from 8.00 am and 4.30 pm Monday to Friday and even one day a week from home. I couldn't imagine a better place where to work.
good,"Existe mucha presión, sin embargo también hay bastantes beneficios que no te ofrecen en otro lugar , por ejemplo 2 permisos cada 90 días o las horas de emergencia si necesitabas entrar más tarde o salir más temprano. Se ofrecen vales de despensa y restaurante que se depositan cada quincena, hay fondo de ahorro y servicio médico. Si no te gustó tu horario o necesitas cambiarlo por un día te dan esa opción, siempre y cuando haya quien acepte el intercambio. La localización es muy conveniente, se puede llegar caminando del metro o metrobús y hay rutas de transporte público. Ofrecen vacantes tiempo completo con uno o dos días de descanso según horas trabajadas y también medio tiempo.  El ambiente laboral es bueno."
good,This company cares about its associates. They value their hard work. If you get a chance to work for a Marriott take it and you will see what a company that cares about you should be like.
good,"Working at Marriott it's all about putting the guest first and making each individual person that walks through the door feel it's all done for them. One must always try to add that personal touch to every interaction, creating a rapport that keeps guests coming back."
good,Great boss and location. Everyone that has been there wanted to be there and management was Awesome! they even gave me time off for school and allowed me to make up the hours.
good,I would love to come back there to work and I also love working there it was a great environment the managers and housekeeping was great and we always made sure the customer was satisfied
good,"It’s a great company to work for, if you stick with the higher tier of the company brands. It would seem the employer’s gratitude for the employees work declines as you decrease down the brand within the company."
good,"There are lots of games, fun, adventure, you can do lots of learning they teach many  basic life saving   like examples C P R, and management  courses"
good,"I have worked for Marriott for years and I have never had a bad experience with them. If you work in operations you need to be flexible in your availability and understand that the hotel is open 24 hours 7 days a week. It is not a good idea to work on site or in operations with a restricted schedule, unless mentioned during your interview so an agreement can be made between you and management."
good,This Company has great staff and great benefits. Free lunch and great PTO and a 401 Package which the company matches. I loved working for Marriott !!!

good,I worked there as part of an internship program designed and put in place by my High School Academy that landed me an interview with this company. A month or so later I was accepted and began work less than a month after the school year ended. It wasnt a difficult job in many ways. Wasnt physically taxing or strenuous in any way but did require me to be ready to be put into an assignment as the hospitality industry is ver come and go.
good,Working for the Marriott was a amazing job I would still be there if I didn’t have to move away. My colleagues were friendly and the hotel is beautiful and full of history.
good,I LOVED my time with Marriott and if I wasn't relocating and moving so far away I would still be there.  I miss it everyday.  My new job just can't compare to the joy I had there.
good,Working from home was a dream job with a variety of opportunities for grow and personal development.  I would recommend this job to anyone looking in this field.
good,The company loves to push their talent to the next level. I wish for more managed by Marriott hotel for Chattanooga so the pool of talent can move up quickly!
good,Great place to advance as long as you work hard. Great guests and a very safe and beautiful environment.  There are many positions to advance to and the experience is one of a kind.
good,"I started in Banquets and I wanted to get my job on my experiences alone. I had to walk in my high heels with a tray of 10 full plates of rounds from one side of the banquet hall turn around and walk back, setting the tray on the tray Jack. They also gave us a menu and a blank piece of paper and we had to have it 10 minutes. The panel was very impressed I memorized the menu as I re called it back to them. Needless to say I was hired without using my husband's name."

good,"Marriott is a great company to work for. Competitive pay, great benefits, believe in taking care of the guest and they will take care of you. Like any other company, it has its moments but all in all its a pretty decent environment."
good,Great company to work for great team work culture. Everyone helped out and made the flow of work go great for everyone. I enjoyed my job just did not enjoy the fact that no matter how hard i worked and applied for advancements within the company I was passed up and a less experienced worker that was less dependable would get the position.
good,Marriott was a great place to work. It was fun and fast paced. Everyone was very good and professional at their job which made it great to work there.
good,I would say working in marriott is fun and all the associates treat like a family. Management take action if have some issues that need to be address especially problems with other co-worker. One thing I like marriott is diversity.
good,"•Operating varying electronic monetary verification systems"

good,"A typical day at work would be greeting different people everyday making sure everything is right for them. The work place culture was very good, I got to work a lot of great people and different personalities. Every work day awesome just because of who I was working with. Management was the same, they were great people. Always looked out especially knowing it was my first job and always teaching me something new."

good,"Awesome team, very good place to work! Executive committee was amazing to work with. Very open to suggestions and wasn’t micro-managed. Enjoyed meeting with new guests daily, as well as learning to keep bees."
good,Management has open door policy for all associates.  I admired my Director and GM for being engaged with the associates on a daily basis and for their passion to provide exceptional service to our internal and external guests!
good,"I would suggest having a set schedule morning, mid day or late night. It is a bit tiring working a different range of shifts each week. Customer service people skills required"
good,"How good can be work for Marriot international."

good,"The management was great.  The hardest part of the job was the first day.  I didn't know where anything was.  Thankfully, the staff was patient with me and showed me the ropes. Best part of the job was working with the people there.  They were friendly and explained to me how to clean or sort stuff.   I learned that the conference rooms varied in size.  I made a few friends and got along well with others."
good,Overall positive company to work for.  The life/work balance though is tough.  The culture is all about pleasing the associated and guests but managers get little recognition.
good,"I love working there. They have a great team of co workers, management, and policies. A typical day at work is answering incoming calls and assisting with any request, concerns or questions they may have. I learned so many things and there are too many to mention. They have a site you can go to if you need information about anything. Very resourceful. The hardest part about the job is the systems go down for maintenance or for whatever reason but you still have to be available to answer the calls and ask guests to call back in a few hours while we troubleshoot the issues"
good,"Working for Marriott was a great experience, like any other job there were stressful days days and good days."
good,"A very nice company to work for, one of the top rated employers in the world."
good,Excellent team. Fair wages. Excellent environment. Very fun and easy going team nd clientele. Constant activity and excitement among team and guest's. Its family
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed the benefits and great discounts and the PTO hours which is much better than actual vacation hours. The guest were long term guests so you get the opportunity to get to know them and their families.
good,"Overall this place wasn't too bad. However, it was a temp-perm position, if you had the patience to wait for the company to hire you on permanently. And the pay wasn't all THAT great! The agency only paid $11.50/hr + a $100 bonus each week for having perfect attendance, which generally equaled out to be about $14.50/hr. The one upside is that since it was a temp-perm position, you worked for the temporary agency, and they paid every week! They did have pretty good support staff! It was pretty easy to find help, whether that be over the phone or in person. However, they also made promises that they couldn't keep!! Such as promising promotions to a team lead that never came to fruition!"
good,"Count all the money from all of the outlets, make up a deposit, give change out to all of the cashiers."
good,Es una empresa muy buena y valoran mucho a sus empleados y a mi en lo personal me gusta mucho trabajar para esta empresa
good,Easy job. You get payed what you work.  Nice staff. Nice  guest. No problems. Easy job. Easy job. Relaxed job. Paced job. Clean job. Nice job. Smooth job.
good,"Marriott gave me such an amazing opportunity. The management is always there for you when you need them and will help you succeed as long as you put the effort in. I unfortunately had to leave for my mental health that was effected outside of work. Marriott does work with Ransdad (temp agency) and that was the only downside. It brought in a lot of people who didn't really care about the work, coworkers, and the keeping the building clean. The temp agency just hired anyone it seemed like and it really impacted the work environment. When ever Marriott is slow they offer down-time which you dont have to take but you can leave early once it is approved. Management is very flexible when it comes to school schedules as well. I would highly recommend working with them if you want to actually go to work everyday. They also have unlimited overtime for half the year."
good,I was the director of engineering at the Irvine Marriott my day started at 7am until 6-7in the evening in was overseeing a crew of 10 engineers andv5 landscapers I was responcably for the maintance of the hotel and administering the capital improvement projects

It was very great working place as it has all the needed for skills development, always pushes us to get better with training courses and on job cross training. Have knowledge and orientation about the whole departments."
good,Everyone is kind and the days go by quickly. I love the people I work with and never would imagine myself leaving the Marriott brand. Great workplace and even better people.
good,"Awesome, loving place, cool great people.... you will always love coming there great staff, very loving family!! They just great folks.. they treat everyone with respect, and they never turn anyone away..."
good,Marriott is a great company to work for when working for the properties owned and managed directly by them. The same can't be said for their franchised properties. Marriott overall is an amazing brand and they definitely put their clients and employees first.
good,You can count on 40 hrs. and friendly people and plenty of work to do. Work that feels. Not too much always stressful when you have more things to do that what do you started out with but somebody will eventually help you if you cannot finish
good,My experience working at Marriott was productive and fun working with others and not being judged was the best part. The people I worked with were very friendly and so were the guests.

good,There is always room to grow with this company and they really appreciate there employees. They are always giving them ways to learn more about all their hotel properties so you can be more knowledgeable in helping the customers find the hotel for their needs.
good,"This job is great fun because you get to meet such a wide variety of people, all with stories and personalities that are unique. Problem solving created an array of creative solutions, some set into new guidelines, and when you are able to work with a customer and they are satisfied, you are satisfied. The company takes care of its employees well, with pay and benefits in my positions. Vacation is accrued."

good,"Open department"
good,I have enjoyed my time at the Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort. I was working with a great and supportive team which gave me great motivation and support.
good,Since this is the first time that I worked as a room attendant it's kinda hard for me but it's fun to experience a new department/field of the hotel industry.
good,"Working for Marriott is great. The management is understanding and nice and there are many benefits to working for this company. As a part-time worker in the University of Cincinnati area, this is the best job I've ever had while working on my college degree."

good,"I worked at LE MERIDIEN DHAKA. Here my duties were attend guest complain, opareting chiller plant, & completing daily works. Here I learned so many things like BMS system, compression type chiller works, fire fighting training, first aid training, HACCP training etc. My management was suitable for workers they always had doing better for their coworkers to developing their working skills & life. My work place culture was suitable for me every colleagues were very helpful. Here various type's religious people. Any kind of hard works me & my team members completed very well. Every colleagues were very helpful and always they kept happiness with each others ."
good,"I had a typical routines as an intern in Le Meridien. I have learnt so much from top to bottom. Soft skills, communication skills. etc. You name it. There's no fun at all listing all of my personal experience working in that hotel. You just have to experience it yourself. As usual, every workplace have their own charms and challenges. Without all of difficulties that I cherish, there won't be any rooms for improvements."
good,Excellent opportunity to express your culinary talent. The management was always open to new and inventive ways of preparing and displaying the food options.

good,"working at the jw Marriott can be stressful because some of the employees have disabilities that make it hard to work with them. "
good,"A typical day for Breakfast Ambassador starts at 0500. I loved it preparing foods that I ordered, prepping the buffet and the look of inquisitiveness at the early risers wondering if there is hot coffee made and the total look of amazement, happiness, and  thankfulness that comes across their faces when I say ""well of course ! Come on in"". Now that makes me happy. The kids ohhh did I say the kids. Breakfast ? you get to know people on a more personal level. Front desk, I can handle fine. Its a different kind of stress if you will. I take handling other peoples money very seriously. My role at the front desk is I guess is on a  more professional level. I like to be up to date on attractions around the local area so I can pass it along. I like to know what competitive rates other hotels have and know what it is that keeps people coming back. and always be a step ahead ."

good,It's a good place to work the staff is hard working and kind. It's hard work but the benefits are worth it. The senior staff is helpful and easy to talk to.
good,If you are a housekeeper you know how physically demanding it is. Constantly moving and having to finish rooms as fast as you can. They do have head housekeepers that check the rooms. However if you work with someone who really slacks other housekeepers are required to go help. It is a teamwork situation. Pay is competitive. If you work harder and have good management you will be noticed and given more pay.
good,"The Renaissance Harborplace Hotel was the third property where I was employed for seven of the 15-year career of my Marriott Corporation experience.  As the General Cashier, my day consisted of making the daily deposit for the hotel, keeping the cashier's tills fully stocked, and assisting my coworkers in the office whenever I could.  The best part of this job was the autonomy of it all.  If asked about a certain situation, I can find the solution.  If a cashier had an issue with their deposit, I could pinpoint where to start in order to make the corrections.  I really felt great that the management staff trusted me to perform my duties with very little supervision.  The hardest part of the job was picking up the boxes of coins.  Overall, this was a great place to work.  I still use the skills learned in this position to what I do now.  You can't ask for anything better than that!"

good,my time working here was great I met a lot of people. I made friends with many of my coworkers. It was a great environment. Sometimes it was a lot of stress. I had a lot of headaches from bending over a lot and scrubbing the tubs. Somedays there were almost 24 rooms to clean and sometimes 16 rooms. The people there were always so nice and friendly. But the management was sometimes very poor. The manager is one of the reasons I left. I felt that he was sometimes rude and racist
good,"definitely a god company to work for, you will however work till you sweat but you will definitely be recognized and a reward of some sort, even a shout out will be mentioned of you"
good,"Nothing bad to say as it has a brilliant GM and Marriott creates an infectious culture in all of their brands. Staff are spoiled by the TakeCare initiative which provides financial advise, health activities and much mre."

The management is amazing, both intelligent, hard working, helpful. They never fail to lend a helping hand, whether it be through answering questions, or helping lift a heavy object. I would suggest Marriott to anyone looking for a job, if you're willing to work, you'll be a part of the family in no time."
good,Overall great place to work. The environment is service driven. The quality of worker is outstanding. I needed some mobility fro my self. That is why I am applying at other companies

good,Marriott has been by far the best company I have worked for. They listen and appreciate their employees. Only bad thing i have to say is compensation. Work on that and I would have never left.

good,"Working at the Marriott hotel was an exciting experience, everyday at work is like working with family.....Everyone is happy and ready for work! My job was very demanding, coordinating for approximately 60 employees in the Housekeeping Department. The hardest part was keeping everyone on top of their duties for the day, room attendants, house attendants and laundry attendants. What I enjoyed the most were the employees, our department was very diverse with different ethnicities and just learning from them about their culture, I found very humbling."
good,Marriott is a great place to work.  Leadership cares about the employees and the guest experience.  Leadership encouraged employee growth and developed talent for the next level.

good,I would come in and do a daily report to check too see what reservations were made and what was the occupancy was for the day
good,Overall the company is very good.  The problem with good work environment is that the management stays preventing moving into a higher position difficult.  Sometimes you can move to a different department but then its not you experienced department to carry over your knowledge.
good,Typical day at work is during month end. I learned on how to managed time right. The management was so good because they are helping each other and work as one. Even though I'm just a practicumer that time I can see that they are very friendly and always willing to teach me. The hardest part of the job is to receive deliveries in right and careful way.

I got along well with management and even learned how to do inventory, nightly paper work and closing down of the restaurant at night. The hardest part of this job was the quick turn over of employees. We were constantly training and it seems to be counterproductive in the work place. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting the customers that were traveling the states and staying in the hotel, it was nice to talk to them about where they come from and learning new things about where they come from!"

good,"Typical work day starts at 6am by printing out present day and next days flow sheets that contain all the information for equipment in each meeting room, walk around each meeting room to ensure all equipment is in room and client is helped out using the equipment provided 70,000sqft of meeting space is distributed between two staff members, one supervisor and one manager. Once all meetings have been checked we regroup and inform the staff of tasks for the day. Co-workes must rely on each other to run a successful operation. Morning crew relies on the night staff to set all the rooms accordingly to ensure morning staff is able to assist clients with any issues that may arise. The hardest part of the job is when ever a meeting pops up with extensive AV equipment requirements because if rental equipment needs to be order or additional labor needs to be called in you have to rely on a third party for last minute service.

I love putting a smile a someone's face, and making unforgettable memories to a person's vacation. The hardest thing about my job is probably when the pool area is very busy and everyone wants something at the same time, but I can't get to all of them at once.

I really think management really cares about thier employees, because they teach us how they want the job preformed everyday, at the start of each day. We have a team where everyone participate and can give there ideas, on how we can provide our guests with the best service possible. I think the hardest part of the job is, getting each suite done according to hotel standards, in the time alloted. I am a perfectionest. I think the best part of the job is when your guest is sattisfied with his/her suite and requests your service when they return to your hotel."

As a front desk associate, you get to meet all kinds of interesting people from all over and even get to know regular guests. It can be challenging, at times, but is overall a rewarding job. Generally, there are many opportunities to advance within the company, if you put forth the effort and work required. I would recommend Marriott to anyone looking for a great place to work."

Most of my day consisted of sorting the jackets by size and handing them out to people before they go into the actual ice tent. I learned from this job to be more assertive with people, as many people feel that the rules do not apply to them, I also learned to become more authoritative as I was put in many positions where I had to tell people what to do while by myself. the most enjoyable part of working here was being treated so well by the company. We got many paid lunches on days we were extremely busy, and our managers would take time and money of their own to help make our works days easier, and they did this by providing snacks and drinks to keep us going throughout the day or by including us in raffles to keep our work ethic going."

good,"Marriott International is a great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunities to grow within the company, and many benefits as well. Typical work days are pretty relaxed, however, there is always something to do. Management is a key factor to success, having been through many managers within my carreer I have witnessed first hand how crucial a leader is. The everyday environment is very upbeat and positive, with dealing with people face to face there is no room for negativity. The hardest part is having to learn the breakdown of everything from billing and payments, to the basics of checking guests in. However, there is so many things to appreciate like getting all the good feedback and surveys from guests, to just getting to meet great people everyday. The job has taught me so many wonderful things such as social skills to hospitality, and teamwork. It is an overall amazing job, and I am glad I have had the opportunity to  experience it."

good,I Enjoy Working With Marriott Because It Is A Great Work Environment. I Enjoy Interacting And Assisting Guest And Making Them Feel At Home While Away Traveling.
good,"Working for front desk, is fun sometimes depending who you working with and your guest. I like to be easy going, best about the job is the benefit of hotel discount for employees. Lowest one i seen is $35 a night for marriott properties only. I got one week paid vacation. Health insurance is optional they take it away from your paycheck though. The hardest part of the job is checking in guest by yourself ONLY if you have like 60 and above guest checking in. So it is fast pacing job, depending where you live. If you live in a big city, then its really that busy. You have to deal with guest complaints also and resolve it. If your not people person, then this job is not for you. I have learned to deal with customers when it comes to complaints. On the job Training is 2 weeks where i work, so pay attention if you do get hired. My goal is to work from home, i heard they pay more. I will suggest to start off salary is $10 and up, and make sure they give you a raise. A typical hourly rate SHOULD BE between $13-$17 hour. Depending the city you live, if your hotel is busy it should be more, but that is my opinion. On top of that you have to be standing 8hrs a day. I wish my hotel includes 401 k. Some Marriott properties does, so check on that. Hotels are 24 hrs open for front desk. So if Christmas or any holiday comes up and falls on the day that you work. You are not off you have to work your shift unless, if you ask your coworker to work for you, them maybe you get lucky. (rarely happens though)"
good,"This was the best job I had ever landed; but due to things occurring I may have to resign/be terminated. But if I could work here till the day I die, I would. It was the best job; my manager was amazing, the team was amazing and the overall environment was great."

The staff is hard on the team but means well, all in learning. It's the whole ""work hard, play hard"" but they treat us employees very very well. It was a very tough job, I was the youngest on the team, everybody there was 19+ and I was 16, but I met some amazing people, and they pay was very well at the age I was. Overall you will LOVE the people there, very welcoming, and caring."
good,I enjoy making a connection with every guest and strongly believe my product knowledge is what made the clientele enjoy my table side manner. Parcel 104 brought many opportunities of education from management to vendors providing a enjoyable opportunity for all staff. Management is the key to a successful running machine from front of the house to the back of house. I had to think real hard at answering the hardest part of the job and only thing I could say was dealing with coworkers that made it difficult day in and day out with negative attitudes. I enjoy my life and feel very blessed with my family so that makes me enjoy every day.
good,"Strong customer service values, management very professional, good benefits and opportunity to learn and grow. Competitive salary, flexible with the study"

good,"Truly enjoy this company and the work place environment. This company has great health benefits as well as retirement plans. The property has a heated pool, hot tub, sauna, gym, basketball court, and much more that is offered to the employees for no charge. Management could use some improvement in different aspects. Some things seem backwards. Working as a housekeeper is very hard work."

good,"This is the second time I've worked at this property, and the reason I came back is thatl I was treated so well the first time. Most Marriott properties are franchises but this is a corporate hotel, and they care about their employees. Full time benefits are very good, and even part timers get PTO and room discounts. They are very good about granting time off requests, and they care about keeping their workers happy. Many long time employees at this property.The only issue is a continual turnover in mid-and lower management positions, which is disruptive to some employees. Constant training of new supervisors/managers and the strain on other management while those positions are being filled is a problem and needs to be addressed."

During Spring time and around horse race time, we were crazy busy! A lot of regulars as well and they always remember you, which is nice. Working Holidays is BIG money for not only a hostess but servers as well. I worked my tail off on Thanksgiving and enjoyed every minute of it. Taking reservations for Holidays starts early because it is soooo amazing. You get free meals from the buffet which is also crazy good. The people I worked with made this job 100 times more enjoyable, I really miss working with them. Started at 8.75 per hour then 4ish months later, I got a 2 dollar raise."

The staff is great, everyone is very friendly and welcoming of new staff. Also, the training program for new staff members is amazing! The benefits offered by Starwood Hotels are, by far, my favorite asset of the company. A typical work day for me is pretty busy, as we hold 726 rooms. We are the 2nd largest hotel in the Kansas City area. The most difficult part of my job is managing my time, as you never know what problems will brew, or how long it will take to resolves these problems. However, it is a very rewarding job and i look forward to my career growth with the company."
good,"Well ,during my tenure in this hotel, I never encounter any circumstances both guest and the management as well my staff.because I knew how to control the  problems."

good,"Every day is different due to the clients we have and that is what excites me.  I have learned how to manage and explain financial data, how to lead teams and promote success.  In addition, I have learnt how to incorporate growth and development sessions especially during our monthly meetings.  Since this is a smaller property management works well together and our job functions sometimes mingle with each other.  There is great team work from both leadership and associates.  The hardest part of the job is meeting space turnover in limited amount of time with limited personnel.  Due to our location we tend to have a good amount of pop up meeting requests which financially works to our favor.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the joy in a contacts face or group from a successful event especially social events."
good,I like this job. Advancement is easy. I like working one on one with people. Its a very easy job. This company cares about their people. They have a very good system to train employees before putting them on the phones.

good,"I was very excited to have a starting pay of $13/hr! I don't know of any other call center that even comes close to that. They do have a strict attendance policy, but, I think we all would if we were a Fortune 500 company with paying people that much. I no longer work there, because of attendance issues, but they did try their hardest to have me stay. I had 2 1x1s a week, and my coach was amazing and really helped me out! Super diverse company, and the only complaint I would have is that the upper management doesn't seem to care a whole lot - however, the coaches and supervisors make up for that."
good,"Lovely place! I love My coworkers!!!!!,,,, There very understanding with your personal life!!!! i just would like to have more money!!!!"
good,Great place to meet new connections and to explore new possibilities in life. Gives you the option to travel and their benefits are great! Definitely an amazing place to work for.
good,Enjoyed working at the Westin recommended for all to visit.Beautiful property awesome landscape.Helpful and friendly staff. It was pleasure for me to call Westin my home job.
good,When I worked at the Marriott I was a house person and sometimes i did housekeeping. I liked it a lot and it was a fun job. The staff was nice and the guests were nice as well.
good,Management is great. It's all about professionalism yet the essence of caring and being family is there. They attend to your needs promptly. They won't say no to you right away. They listen and cinsider
good,"My typical day at work is fast paced and very interactive. I converse with numerous people on a daily basis and allows me to deal with many different problems in creative ways. Management is all around great and supports their team. They also offer many small incentives that make work fun. My coworkers are all very professional and create a strongly weaved support team. I would say the hardest, but sometimes also the most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job is dealing with the many (and sometimes strange) issues that are bound to arise when working in a hotel, and being able to help guests have the most enjoyable stay imaginable."
good,"Marriott is such a great company to work for. From customer service to taking care of their employees, they really have it all figured out. It was a great place for me to learn in my early stages of my career life, the importance of quality and service. I started there and within a year and a half was promoted to sales manager at only 27 years old! When the economy took its turn for the worst, we all lost our jobs, and that's when I went to Resorts West Vacation Club."
good,Very good working atmosphere and culture. I learned a lot from this multinational company. Everything is hardest part but I am enjoying that very much.
good,"Meeting different people and connecting with some of them."
good,"Most enjoyable part is shaking new hands everyday and interacting with people daily face-to-face. Great staff - everyone gets along. Lots of perks, especially the discounted room rates worldwide. Management is great -- door is always open."
good,"Sin duda, aprendí mucho en este empleo, conocí gente, aprendí y dominé otro idioma"
good,Great. job .I did learn more then I thought .I got refreshed in cash handling .I learned bar tending .Banquets .setting tables .clearing .and more .
good,"great colleagues,"
good,i have learned a lot during my training in Atlanta Marriott Marquis. the people were really nice to us. and i have acquired all the necessary skills and knowledge that i needed to pursue my career.
good,Marriott is a great company to work for providing a great work life balance with an equally great benefits package. The management team at this property is the best I have seen.
good,"Nice place to work,people are fun to work with .I have been working there for a short period of time and all I can say about the hotel is that everything is fine ."
good,"Fun to work at. Great perks as an employee and many ways to build a career. Good health insurance, dental. 401k and employee discount."
good,"I've never worked for a company so willing to let me succeed before, nor have I worked for a company that actually cared so much for it's employees. The day in the life working here is pretty straight forward, you take phone calls in a brightly painted room. However, everyone there has such a positive outlook on life. Even as I moved into management, quite quickly I might add, higher ups were willing to work with my schedule as much as they could. If you want to try to work at a call center but you are afraid you won't like it, this is where you should apply. Even if you don't like the job, it will most likely be because it just isn't the right industry for you."
good,In the time I have worked for Marriott I have learned a lot in the past three of working with them. I have learned how to manage an event put the crew and the right personal for the job to manage it. A day at work for me is getting the schedule ready for the following week also making sure that are event space is set up and ready to go for our upcoming events or events in progress. I also deal with a lot of customers on a daily basis helping them with questions they may have about our hotel or event space or pricing or who they can talk to if they want to book something with us or plan an event with us. The associates at the Marriott are very friendly kind and helpful and always have each others back. Management at my job are very outgoing with associates and try to help everyone and make sure everyone is being taken care of and treated fairly. The hardest part of my job will probably be that i don't have reliable workers meaning as in they call off a lot and not show up on time and dealing with that can be a little frustrating because when you don't have the right personal or people for the job it makes things harder not only on you but everyone else as well. Overall I enjoy everything about my job from the staff to the events to the property everything.
good,"I have had the privilege of working for an amazing company since 2009.  Love this industry, love this company.  I have traveled across the country, met and worked with the most incredible and talented people."
good,"The staff at the hotel is what makes it such a fun and enjoyable place to work. Everyone feels like they are part of a big family and they really look out for each other. In hectic situations, everyone knows how to buckle down and work together to make the guests feel as comfortable as possible. The Marriott has great discounts on hotels worldwide, which is a nice perk when you get to travel and stay at one."
good,aprendes mucho de las personas que te rodeas sobre todo del los chef que estan de encargados en areas especificas.
good,"take care for associates, Lots of training to grow. Not difference between gender. learned more. people are so friendly. helping others.enjoyed to work. Difference people."
good,A good place to work. Very professional management. Time is always available. Get to see interesting people. Must be flexible with work time.
good,"Very nice people to work with. The Starwood management supports you a lot in achieving your goals."
good,"I'm the night auditor of the hotel. The shifts kinda gets tiring after a while. but great benefits. Co workers are great ppl to work with, hardest part about the job is staying up at night. Management here is excellent and very caring"
good,"Great place to work, although not at all trusting of their employees. House keepers call for help because a guest rearranged their room and furniture was too heavy for one person to move safely. After returning from assisting, get jumped on by management for not doing my job and "" Messing Around "".  Co-workers were all great, got to meet interesting guests and had the opportunity to learn new skills."
good,The hardest thing about the job is not having consistent work. I also like the fact that we have a lot of the summer off. I love my coworkers. I've learned so much from management and my coworkers
good,Easy job. Everybody was really chill and laid back. We look out for each other. A lot of the guests are regulars in town on business that come back every week - leads to friendships
good,"Marriott is the largest hotel company in the world and they really care about each individual employee. Part-time, Full-time, management, GM, you name it - all cared for great!"
good,"Training employees, analyzing the front desk budget, setting schedules, welcoming and assisting guests,"
good,Great place to work with great people who care about one another. If you can get a job with them you will find a company steeped in culture and compassion.
good,If you are in the hotel industry you need to give Marriott a try. If you work hard you might make it to there corporate offices where you work mon-fri only.
good,great work enviroment. the staff is friendly and the management teams are great. The guests are always friendly and a fun place to work. would recommend this job to anyone
good,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide (MVW) is separate from Marriott International. I worked for MVW. "
good,The typical day was very busy but I really enjoyed the work. Being a part of the team showed me how to copy with problems at work.
good,"A typical day at work is pretty smooth. I learned a lot of key tools."
good,"No two days were ever the same. Job involved checking people in/out, closing all end of day reports, providing reports to several departments, meeting with coworkers and managers to go over all front desk goals, answering phones and being available to pitch in across different departments when necessary."
good,Management was always supportive and treated us more like a family than staff. I've never worked around pets until working here. The staff always took care of the guest and accommodated their pets as well.
good,"Night audit positions can be draining sometimes due to the hours, but Starwood Hotels (and specifically the Westin Denver Downtown) has made my time there enjoyable and fulfilling.  Due to forces outside of our control, we were short-staffed for almost six month at the beginning of my time in this position.  In spite of this, management and even fellow employees offered support and assistance and we were able to make a possibly tough situation a success.  The most enjoyable parts of my job are the ""puzzles"" in accounting and auditing that I need to solve and resolve on a regular basis.  There is continuity in the position but there is always something to investigate and reconcile.  The hardest part of my job is the impact of the graveyard shift, hence why I am looking for a daytime position (there are none currently available at this location or I would gladly stay).  Management always equips me with education in ever evolving procedures and technology.  It has been a very enjoyable experience."
good,I really enjoyed and loved working at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites. I got to work and meet a lot of wonderful people. I also meet a lot of different wonderful people with different background cultures.
good,"I always get the job done and when there is a bit of extra work my boss will always ask instead of telling me, which give me options which i truly appreciate."
good,Marriott is a great company to work for. It gives its associates the opportunity to grow and excel. The company provides many training tools and management programs for the associate to reach their goals and grow within the organization.
good,I enjoy working at Courtyard and would recommend to anyone.  I enjoy working with the staff here and love meeting new people.
good,"This is one of the best hotels to work for, especially in the area. Employment turnover is short and people are appreciated for what they do. They company recognizes and rewards performance as well as gives training and potential for advancement. Work culture is friendly and family oriented."
good,"No company like it, i think its the best company to work for. I wouldnt trade my years of work for anything. this has been a great deal in my life."
good,8 years of Marriott service was a wonderful experience. Love interaction with customers and meeting new people. I learned a lot from managing a team of 15 employees.
good,"Assisted the regional director with procurement, resort trouble shooting, training and site inspections. Working with owners and other General managers with cost control, service enhancements and the like type of work"
good,"I am very passionate about working with people."
good,"The property was crazy busy, but the employees wer amazing. I loved interacting with people from all around the world. Work seemed to be less monotonaous when travelers from all over would come and share their experiences and stories. Great place to work overall."
good,"working as a filing clerk and sometimes receptionist was a fairly stress free job.This was my first job in America and it was a good one. I learned a lot of things like answering phones properly, interacting with clients, filing paperwork."
good,"It is a good property to work with. And the restaurant 55&5th, I work in is fantastic. The team in my restaurant is good. We normally have 9 hrs duty shift including break time. It is a New York style Fine dining steak house. The hotel has been managed perfectly."
good,Fun place to work with a very chilled and supportive management. Its all about personal & career development. Le Royal Meridien had set standards high for the other hotels to meet.
good,"I had the best working experience in my life in Marriott hotel. The overall organisational culture which is very professional was beneficial for me as I was learning every day something new from people that had the willingness to show me and teach me the management of human resources.

All the managers that I have worked with at Marriott have been nothing great/supportive leaders, always trying to better their employees. The hardest part of the job for me was when I first started because I had no hotel background so trying to understand my position as well as hotel operations took some time but was very rewarding.

Copa Loca is one of the two pool side bars, which is a beautiful environment to work in,everyone is on vacation and having a good time. Majority of the guests were owners and would stay on property for months at a time so you got to build relationships with them. Management was great, they had an open door policy and were very supportive. The most challenging part of the job was working outdoors in the Florida heat. The most enjoyable was creating unforgettable experiences with guests during entertainment nights like Karaoke for example. I feel very fortunate to have worked in a place like the Copa Loca."

The GM of the hotel is also the area managing director of 12 hotels in Atlanta and Birmingham, who taught me how to manage a large luxury hotel with a well experienced senior leadership team in a difficult metro market while controlling expenses for a very aggressive budget set forth by our ownership group. The hotel maintained the lowest CPOR of all W hotels in the brand while increasing occupancy from 72% to 79% and ADR from $159.00 to $165.00.  Because of my leadership abilities, my transition from F&B to rooms has given me the skills for a promotion to an AGM, DOO, or DOR."
good,"I manage a great team, We work hard and have tons of fun. My typical day is first finding out how my team is operating and making sure they have the right tools that they need to keep our operation running efficiently and productively.

They had patience with me, trained me quickly, and quickly left me with enough trust to run things on my own. If you want a good company to work for, I suggest applying here. It really is a TEAM environment."
good,Having worked at Marriott for many years i was able to move around and work many places. My day had me dealing with customers tending to there needs and support. I worked and managed computer tasks. Dealing with my own bank and maintaining accounts. At times I had to do inventory and stocking while dealing with other departments and getting my supplies needed for my day. Worked well with co workers but i also worked alone at times doing different tasks that had to be made and that was appointed to me. I don't think there was a big or hard part of my job the only thing what was a problem was when we were short handed employers and we had to do longer hours and work faster. However the employers and our customer satisfaction was the best part of the job.

It was hard to leave this hotel as it truly became my home away from home as they were like my family.  During this short time period, it was a pleasure to work for such an encouraging General Manager and Regional Director who provided me with the necessary tools to maintain an exceptional front desk and bell staff.  I was also asked to become part of Marriott Task Force where I was asked to spend the month of June 2014 in Anchorage, AK training another manager on all Marriott operations.  She still looks up to me as her mentor and has won a few Service Excellence Awards along the way!  I believe in the Marriott culture wholeheartedly and would definitely become an asset to your hotel family!"

The people are incredibly friendly. The management is eager to help in career advancement. And my favorite part of all: I actually felt accurately compensated for the work that I put in."
good,"A typical day starts with me arriving 20 minutes early so I can get myself situated and sign into my applications for what I'm going to be processing reservations. Over the years of working at Marriott, I learned to become very patient and detailed oriented. Always to make sure to listen to what the guest are saying and come up with a solution if a problem were ever to arise. I have had some very great managers. They are very caring and understanding. If there is a problem with particular job requirement or any problem outside of work, they are always there for a listening ear. I met some very great friends here. We established a bonding friendship and help each other when one is not on phone calls. The most hard part about the job is being unable to negotiate or honor rates. That can be very challenging at times. I love the fact that I get to talk to people from all ends on the world and build a rapport with them to keep them coming back."

The management and co-workers were always happy to give advice and point me in the right direction whenever I needed it and they were available to. The hardest part of the job for me was having to ring around different hotels and venues as at the time it was out of my comfort zone. While the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team of people that are friendly and always willing to help each other out."

I would go out to the desk and Check in with my co- workers and see what the room availability was. Then I would start checking the guest in or out as well as answer any calls that came in. I got along with everyone that worked and had built relationships with the long term guest that had stayed at the hotel.

They provide and annual raise typically 25 cents or 50 cents. The employees are great to work with. They become your family.

He had no understanding  of  family  obstacles  and  no empathy  for  anyone. They lost employees  that  worked  20 plus  years  because  of  his  non management. He didn't  stay  long just  long enough  to  destroy  a lot  of  people career.

I was chosen to be one of of the lucky people at my college to do a four months internship at the Westin Langkawi Resort and Spa. I learned how to engage with the guests and ensure that they have an outstanding experience with the hotel. The staff were really nice and supportive when needed. One of their downfalls is how immature and disrespectful they sometimes can be with each other. They would instantly turn on you and act as if you were their enemy for no apparent reason!! One of the many things that I liked was how flexible the management can be, for instance; if you had an important  matter to do on a day you're supposed to be working, there's no problem in switching that day to become your off day so you don't face any issues in whatever you want to do."

As last when I left last month back home they couldn't believe that I was leaving, even few of the staff members came to Heathrow to see off me. English or European culture is when work is finished they go home a different person, however since the day one when I joined I could make a change in their day to day life, like  calling sick, there in UK Sick was paid so initially staff used to call sick left and right, When I came I could reduce the same drastically. "

As a housekeeper, I'm responsible for the general management and running of a household or hotel, in particular ensuring that all staff working within the premises carry out their jobs correctly and efficiently. What i learned is the main task is to ensure that all jobs within hotels are completed in time. And for this reason i have to oversee all staff working on the premises. The hardest part of the job is working on your own, like if theres more than 5 rooms, i clean them all by myself. After cleaning within rooms, i have to double-check again.The job of a housekeeper is demanding as you have to be great with people like your co-workers but willing to stand your own ground.

They're ordinary people who just happen to own a multi million dollar hotel chain.  When we were celebrating a major anniversary, they shut down the call floor for an hour to celebration.  At the celebration, Mr. Marriott himself said that he took reservations calls that morning.  The pay and benefits are great and the staff is friendly.  The GM for this center is fabulous, she knows every employee by site and name (I think there were 1,500 employees at that time.)  Because this is Marriott's largest call center, they have hotels come into to promote their hotel and the area where it's located.  They usually have drawings for gifts or bring food."

good,"Everyday is a learning day either from the boss, colleagues, and guests. It is a never ending day, a tiring but a very good experience. You work for 11 hours per day and rest for 2 days until it became a routine. Whatever happens back home can never bring to the working place, like theater, you have to act everyday, whatever you feel inside. Working with different nationality in a department is one of the best, you could learn from them and at the same time the bonding is different. Everyone has their own different personalities and strategies which if it used properly will bring out a good team but the hard time will never be out of the picture of course, there are times wherein people are all working with pressure and guests giving us a hard time but it is the best part when you overcome with it with the help of the your team and management. This is one of the best I like with this hotel, people are helping each other not only as colleagues but as family, never heard anyone bring down the other one but they will always be the first one to bring out the best in you, they will always give you the chance to show what you have got and what you can able to do which makes you feel important and appreciated."

It was always such a great feeling to find a sweet deal on a hotel room for the customer and hear how grateful they were for your assistance. Sometimes the customers would call and talk to your supervisor to let them know how awesome you were and then you actually got a pat on the back from your supervisor. It was a great feeling. The only thing I did not like was sitting for 8 hours straight. My butte would hurt about hour 5. Don't get me wrong I can sit for hours like anyone else but 8 hours hurts. You learn to stand and type at the same time, and to stretch when possible. And the headset is corded, so your ""leash"" would not let you go far to walk around in between calls. There was not a lot of time between calls, sometimes only a matter of seconds. Sometimes there was 2 or 3 mins and you could stand and stretch. But it was fun. I loved it.
