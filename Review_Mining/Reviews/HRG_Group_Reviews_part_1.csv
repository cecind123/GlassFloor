bad,HRG Group is a public holding company which is being unwound. The company is in the process of selling off its remaining business units which should be completed by mid 2018
bad,It's a family owned business going through growing pains. The son is taking over the business and has a different vision that the father. I felt like live in a strange mix of the 1970s and the future at harbinger.
bad,Worked among very few employees but it was nice working here as well. Worked on a Security project which was good for knowledge and I enjoyed my work.
good,"• Working for Junior, Middle Level and Senior Level Vacancies"
good,"overall I had a good experience."
good,Was a great adventure but I did not survive. You run your own business under the firm as 1099. A few made it past 3-4 years but most had spouses with solid incomes so they did not have the pressure. Business shut down by FED's due to improper practices by CEO who was violating law.
good,Harbinger group is a good place to work but employee project allocation policy is too worst. The salary structure is too worse. The company share of PF is also taken from the employee's salary

good,I loved the job I had as inspector. Crawled on carpet mending it high lighting any part of carpet that needed it. Had the best co workers and supervisor of any company. We all helped each other out when anyone needed help. We all considered each other as family.
good,Typical work day was from 8-5 sometimes overtime was required.  I learned a lot with this company.  My co-workers were great.  They were more like a family than co-workers.  This was a fantastic company to work for.
