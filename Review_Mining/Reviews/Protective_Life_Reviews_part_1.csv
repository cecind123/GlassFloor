rating,review
bad,Health and dental insurance is horrible. Managers ride you.  High turnover.   Other benefits are bad.  If you like being ridden all the time then this is the job for you.  I am trying to find another job.  My advise is to run not walk away from this employer
bad,"Poorly managed company,brings on more work load and doesn't give the employees any repercussions of these actions and doesn't appreciate what the employees go through with these changes."
bad,"Way out in the western suburbs and all the IT jobs are located in Alabama. Who wants to live in Alabama??? Dont trust management as they have ladder climbers there who will backstab u."
bad,Not the best place to work at. Management is horrible. Do not back their employees up. The expect too much from employees with little pay. Reviews are based on if your manager likes you.
bad,"Extremely low pay for what the job entails. Micromanagers that expect overtime. Some employees work two jobs to make ends meet. You are expected to clock in and out for breaks, lunch, worktime, etc. Very big brother and like an assembly line at a factory. Someones making money there but its not the people doing the actual work."
bad,"Do not enjoy field of work, processing death claims and or dealing with terminal illness. Depressing to handle loss of life daily."
bad,"Not a fun or diversified place to work. The management has no idea how to facilitate customer or employee culture.."
bad,"Management have their favorites. If you are not apart of a click, you will NOT advance. NO JOB SECURITY!!! Do not apply, I've been there long enough to know their patterns. Human Resources has come up numerous times trying to understand why the morale is so low. Also a high turnover....BEWARE!!!!"
bad,Just a pathetic environment
bad,"Lies, negative feed back, over worked, short of staff, stressful, lousy manager, HR does not keep it confidential, lousy manager, no Christmas bonus, micro manage up the wazu, two of the better customer service managers left within four months, not friendly atmosphere, upper management doesn’t care higher HR doesn’t care, 7 employees went to HR on the processing manager and nothing was done about it, employees are leaving, employee on maternity leave does not plan on coming back and if I forget to mention a horrible processing manager!!!"
bad,"Protective lures people to the company with false promises of autonomy and advancement. Once you get there, you're quickly pigeon-holed into a ""have or have not."" "
bad,"I saw, more times than I care to mention, management trying find ways to fire people.  the lengths this company goes to, to find reasons to fire you if you do not play along and say the company is great.  Not only that, in the time I worked there (18 years), I saw it go from a family-friendly culture to one where the employees were just a number and management did not really care about their employees.  It was about the almighty dollar.  I would not work here again if I was given a 6-figure salary.  Awful awful place."
bad,"If you are temp to hire, they will dangle that carrot. Promised 90 days. Left after 6 MONT and still not hired. You can do the best you can and they will make it impossible. Be careful! The process makes it very difficult to score a decent score on adherence. Calls take 1/2 hr to 2 hrs and if your break or lunch falls during that time, it takes off of your score. Never missed a day. Never was late and managed to obtain the 92 average on time. The QA team is a joke and it's a gamble if you get a decent score. And two managers told me what I was doing was OK> I got marked off and instead of saying don't do it that way and we won't hold this against your score this time.. manager did not back me up. Don't trust them.  Oh.. and if you work till 8 pm, don't count on leaving at 8pm"
bad,"Working at Protective Life- Continuous changes "
bad,"I was employed with protective for 5 years. I lived an breathed this company. I started in the annuity contact center and worked very hard to be as productive as I could and master all of the different products that were handled.  After being  burned out by call center work and a new system being put in place that monitors every second of your day, I applied for a position in the claims department. The training in this department was awful I was trained by a representative who was barely meeting their own goals. My systems were not fully up and running for 6 months. I struggled to met  expectations which no one else was held to besides me (every claim looked at 100%). It was an awful transition hr ended up getting involved and was shocked at the lack if training I received.  The training in the call center was also awful I learned everything on my own, with no financial background. This is not a good choice if you have done the exact same work at another life insurance company. The pay is slightly higher than average but the amount of stress is not worth the one or two dollars more an hour. I reffered a few people to this company while working there and no one stayed longer than a few months, and they were qualified canitdiates."
bad,"Enjoyed the competitive nature of the inside sales of Life Insurance through Protective Life.  In my last year, very poor management support, had a new manager."
bad,So not apply at this company. They will tey and break you amd your morals by giving you pure negative feedback. They are outsourcing jobs and will lie to you that their not. Current employees with over 20 years of expierance plan on leaving once they find other employment. The worst the processing department.
bad,I learned alot at this company and met some lifelong friend's. I miss the compliments and the rewarding feeling that came with helping the customer's. The first year at this company was great! Things slowly began to change for the worst after they fired upper management.
bad,"You put in long hours, team moral is very low no incentive to motivate since Company was bought. Inter office promotions is highly overlooked and outsourced."
bad,In my opinion working at Protective has provided me with valuable experience in regulatory affairs.  I have learned a lot about the insurance industry
bad,"While the customer base is the best I've experienced in a customer service role, the ""adherence"" requirements are unreasonable.  This standard requires many of my coworkers and myself to take shortened or altogether forgo our lunches and or breaks.  It is extremely difficult to achieve the 93% adherence to our schedules due to the length of our calls which range from 25 minutes to well over an hour.  If our adherence falls below the ninety three percent, graduated punitive action is taken against us."
bad,"Management is horrible. One of them sleeps at his desk all the time, the other always seems angry and the other manager micromanages everyone even the people NOT on her team. They dont care about their employees. Management even gives their work to their employees for them to do and then they'll take credit for it. Protective as a company is good but this department ruins it for the whole company. Just say no for your own mental sanity."
bad,Protective has poor management and there is no opportunity for advancement. Also the pay is really low for the workload that is given.
bad,While my current position does not allow for much upward movement our company has acquired other insurance companies which has in turn increased our workload yet the grunts have seen no increase in pay with sometimes 50% increase in expectations. Our raises have averaged 2% per year (and I am one of the good employees) while the CEO and upper management reap tons of money in stock options.
bad,"Work days can be extremely long. Weekend work is required with little to no advance knowledge. Co-workers are ""clicqued"" and do not take kindly to outsiders. Policies and rules change on a daily basis. So much so that I found myself keeping abreast to the changes while at home. Homework again?? Bad location. The pay is great...that is all."
bad,"I started off at Protective wide eyed and hopeful, looking forward to a new career. I left beaten down, suspicious and insulted. The outward appearance is one of smiles and friendliness, but that is just a facade. Backstabbing, pettiness, and an ""every person for themselves"" attitude is the truth of things. Even what should be the simple act of collecting information on insurance processes from subject matter experts became a nightmare of canceled meetings, delays and hostility (borderlining on sabotage). Protective has a reputation for employees staying a long, LONG time, and it's true. Trouble is that those same employees jealously guard their ""fiefdoms"" and do not like change of any sort."
bad,Very ticky tack.  They monitor how many times that you say please and thank you.   They pay is okay.   The benefits are stellar.    If want to work here be prepared to sit at your desk all day long and be critiqued with a fine toothed comb.
bad,A step back in time. Tenure shop vs performance atmosphere. A 'no problems here' culture despite results.  Can be successful with horrible treatment of others. No collaboration.
bad,The culture of this company has changed over the years. Extreme micromanagement has become the way of life to a point or employee humiliation.
bad,"Salaries and career advancement opportunities are below par.  2-3% pay raises for the workers, while the senior leadership sock away 12% pay raises.  The salaries/bonuses are extremely barbelled in Birmingham."
bad,"Loyalty means nothing and brass with no people skills only listening to each other, no career path set for most of the departments... and a horrible HR department."
bad,"Firm is getting out of the annuity business, products are subpar compared to rest of the industry, no growth going forward, most of the sales force has turned over in the past few years"
bad,"no comment, everybody experience is different based on preference. I say try the company and develop an opinion. I think any company is based on an employee needs and everybody needs are different"
bad,My typical day consists of logging into a phone system and conducting interviews. There is an occasional shift between inbound and outbound calls and call times are widely ranged.
bad,Like anything you have to take the good with the bad. There are some great people here. There are also some viscous people here. Very deceptive management team and HR department. Favoritism runs rampant. This company has some real problems in the products it sales and the overall way they do business. They recently launched a campaign to revamp the look and public view of the company. Due to very poor treatment of customers and agents they could not sell products or conserve the business they have. I was also told by three managers at this company they(HR) take extreme measures to void unemployment payments and severance packages. Very sad place but if you are looking for pay and benefits they are competitive. After years of employment I had to resign.
good,"Protective does not empower their employees. Micro manages them instead. If you're a manger, you have it easy, no phone calls and no customers screaming at you."
good,"I’ve worked for Protective for 3 years now and I would highly suggest not working here, there’s no room for error, advancement/ in house employment, pay increase very little or flexible scheduling-school, trianing is poor and management sucks!"
good,"The company has nice facilities, but the managerial culture has changed drastically in the past couple years. Managerial lines are often blurred and human resources has become too involved with managers and don't have the employee's best interests at heart."
good,"Protective was an okay place to work.  I have stayed here for over 5 years because of the benefits.  However, during that time I had to work a second job because I was not compensated enough to live.  My personality does not fit a corporate office atmosphere, and I have an opportunity to get benefits elsewhere so I am looking to move on."
good,The work life balance was the biggest benefit. Company is going through many changes and restructuring and eliminating positions. Unfortunately it is requiring employees to work many hours of overtime as the standard.
good,"Stressful workplace with no regard for family life. This company is only concerned with bottom line profits. Limited advancement opportunities with weak pay increases."
good,"The company does not support any fast track system to move up in the company. Your work goes unnoticed as management only cares about the numbers and not how you are helping the team overall. One minute the work is only yours to do, the next team call it is Protective's work and we should all be happy to have a job."
good,"Things are good as long as you keep to yourself otherwise, you can easily get caught up in the office politics. However, you are treated differently if you are not the right nationality."
good,"The position was very fulfilling ,the training could've been more detail ,my manger didnt have any knowledge about the job no help there.  Not a bad place to work more detail training is needed .ASAP"
good,Protective does not foster an environment where upward progression is made available for it's employees.  It is very difficult to trust leadership.  No transparency.
good,Slow in hiring contractors.  Management in the claims area is very biased and it is a who you know kind of place to work.
good,"Fun, laid back environment which helps deal with the stress (for some people) of daily activities. However, some departments do let ALOT go unpunished and what was fun at the start tends to turn into mismanagement."
good,Great employees and staff. Management is lacking. Too many chiefs & not enough Indians. Too much drama being stirred by the managers that are hired to lead & encourage growth. The glass ceiling is inevitable & impossible to penetrate.
good,"When I first started the company was great, the management was good and fair, the work environment was more relaxed and enjoyable but within the last 1-2 years upper management doesn’t seem to care how their employees feel. We lack new and up to date systems our IT department is so busy we can’t get things fixed to do our job efficiently and that causes stress for the employees. Management gives us “work arounds” which can cause us to forget a step and make errors which in the end affects the clients. I don’t feel that they care about their employees as they used to and as they should, it’s all about numbers now."
good,"A typical day at work is that you come in , plug into your phone and computer and just sit and answer calls,. you are not allowed to leave your desk for any reason and if you do you have to ""clock in and out"" with the reason you are leaving your desk. you get 1/2 lunch and the two 15minute breaks are discouraged, you are told your hours when you are hired and then afterwards your hours can be changed by your management at any time. They seem to feel that family life is not important.  you are basically strapped to your desk and not allowed to leave it for 8 hours.   the co workers are very nice however you really aren't able to socialize as you have to stare at your computer. the benefits are great however."
good,Protective is a very stable company to work for. Offers Flex time and good benefits. 
good,I wish I would have ended up in a different department. The other departments seemed more satisfied. I liked my team members but we were too busy to really interact.
good,"They start you out at a pretty decent amount. You only get 30 min lunch and two 15 min breaks. Hours are set, overtime isn't guaranteed. Benefits are pretty good but very expensive. 401K plan is really good, can build it up pretty quick with a matching system. No set sick days. If you get sick you have to pull from your PTO bucket and you don't have the option to take it unpaid. It has to be paid."
good,People were the most difficult aspect of the job. The work was fulfilling and I learned a lot.  Most enjoyable part was the work life balance allowed. Management was terrible
good,Protective is over all a good company with great benefits but low salary pay. The learning and development department is great.
good,Post and balance billing.  Train new employees. Reconcile and collect on past due accounts. Check system and billing for accuracy.
good,"A typical days in the call center is call after call, some easy, some very advanced.  Sometimes feels like more people would ease some of the callers complaints.  "
good,"Haven't worked here in over a decade. Began in the premium processing department with no experience. Left the company to relocate, but returned 3 months later and was offered a position in the claims department, which I felt was a good fit. Enjoyed being a Long Term Disability Insurance Adjustor until laid off,"
good,"Take and fill orders for client and Sales persons. Mostly investment/retirement products. Annuities, etc..  Also kept up with inventory and re-stocking."
good,"Family orientate, professional, and respectable company. A typical day at work is fairly busy and productive. I've learned team building skills that I can use in future employment."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Education is available to further your skills. Ability to work remote is also available if you wish to. Co-workers offer assistance when needed
good,A tight-knit group of people that worked hard and supported each other thru steady as well as trying times. Management was very approachable and fair.
good,Protective Life has the overall finest group of people I've ever worked with. This is key to their success as the management is fairly weak in some areas. It's really a place where an employee's opportunities and experience will depend upon their department.
good,Productive environment. Supportive Management. Decent amount of red tape and politics but expected of a company of that size. Great support group and coworkers  who loves to help.
good,Interacting with people who have lost a love one. Deals with irate customers who are grieving on a daily basis. Listens and empathizes accordingly.
good,"A lot of research, reports and emails are required for my job. It is challenging looking for documents or files necessary to complete a job request. I really enjoy communicating with reinsurers as well as banks concerning Immediate Benefits for a beneficiary. My co-workers are great as well as my direct manager! I think the hardest part for me is the stress in being responsible for the amount of money processed through my department. The most enjoyable part is working on a great team."
good,"Learned alot about insurance claims, was offer the oprtunity to manage. Great environment"
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent at Protective Life but after the Rushton's relinquished leadership, it became all about the numbers.  Employees were no longer appreciated."
good,"It was an okay place to work, some job placements more enjoyable than others. Benefits pretty reasonable, and dress code business casual. Not much room for interacting with coworkers though."
good,"Nice place to work with valid benefits. The true value is in the service to the customers and the people with whom you work. Leadership is clear, fair and respectful of life/work balance."
good,"A good company to work for. I would still be working there but, they closed the Greenville, SC office."
good,"Good place to work, Everybody is very friendly good work environment."
good,"I loved working for PLICO, it was a family atmosphere; I worked at PLICO from June 1985 until 2000 when they sold their dental block of business.  Yes sometimes the salary incentive was low and it seemed they wanted more bang for the buck than they were willing to pay.  The benefits were good, flex time was awesome it allowed me to make appts. with out having to request time off to go the doctor, dentist, etc… I always thought they pretty much kept the employee in mind."
good,"I am reviewing and exploring other opportunities because of the lack of career development. The time I’ve spent at Protective Life Corporation, the company as a whole is a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed my internship here for the most part.There wasn't any real benefits or opportunities for advancement as an intern since most of the staff auditors/management have either a CIA or CPA
good,"Fast paced environment with high goals"
good,"I have learned to operate many computer systems while working at Protective. Also answering a multi line phone system, transfering phone calls and taking messages."
good,the expectation of having to know the job and information for all related departments with little to no training and limited tools and outdated systems.
good,"Generally busy day"
good,"Protective Life is a successfully competitive business model within the financial industry. At one time the smallest of the nation's largest insurance companies, Protective Life recently acquired by Dia Ichi Life one of the world's largest insurance companies. The work environment is aggressive and every evolving. The work is challenging and satisfying. The metric used for performance are current and continuously improving."
good,It was nice to have a job that was very enjoyable. I loved it. Most of the co-workers were willing to work to meet goals. 
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Everyone interested in helping one another, family oriented.  Understanding and ready to work with issues that came up in employees personal lives as well."
good,"I worked in a satellite office based in Brentwood, TN. The main branch was in Birmingham, AL. The office was very laid back and they were very flexible with my hours."
good,"Protective is a great place for flexibility. However, there is very little room for growth and management isn't that great."
good,Nice place to work. The people here are great. The employees can participate in volunteer charitable events sponsored by the company.
good,"Protective offers a lot to their employees like benefits, variety of jobs, and great hours. They make sure that their employees are taken care and will fix any problems that might occur. They put their employees first. All the management that I have encounters with have been great and willing to offer assistance at any time that it is needed."
good,A company that truly believed that doing the right thing was good business; they did not lie to their employees or claimants.
good,I really enjoyed working here.  They had great benefits too.
good,"A nice work environment. The benefits are great, especially PTO."
good,Always looking for ways to make the company stand out. Very regulated business so customer service was extremely important as was market conduct results.
good,"Job was dull and repetitive, "
good,Learned a lot about Insurance tax reporting unfortunately our department was moved to Alabama. Co-workers are nice and the most enjoyable part is that I keep learning.
good,I left a long time 20+ year job because of the poor management I was subjected to.  I watched this company go from employee oriented to profit oriented over the years.  Every leadership change pointed the company in a different direction and pushed employee value lower. Overall I loved my job but the micromanging  dished out by my last manager became more than I could stand.  My health and my family were suffering all for a paycheck and no one would try to help.  I guess my experience and loyalty was not as valuable as hers.
good,"Benefits are unmatched. Community advocates. Incredible team building. Management is known to micromanage, however, job culture is comfortable & secure. Family oriented company."
good,"Protective was a family oriented company when I first began my career 18 years ago. Through the years, the culture has changed. It has become less about the people, which was the biggest reason I enjoyed working here so much. I would still recommend working at Protective. We have great benefits. I have 6 weeks of paid vacation time. The culture has changed since the taken over of Daichi and other upper management changes. The most enjoyable part of my job is building relationships with customers and coworkers. The hardest part would be having difficult conversations with employees that I know were trying their best."
good,"I learned what life insurance is and all of the steps and procedures in completing each policy and all of the areas that each policy much go through in order to be approved and inforced. I also learned how to be an administrative assistant, by which I mean handling scheduling and arranging meetings and seminars and making sure that my boss had all of the paperwork and insurance information that he needed so that each meeting went as he intended."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working/talking with clients over the phone. Because I had a great manager, when I would wake up in the morning I never felt unhappy about having to go to work.  My manager was great!  There really was no true hard part about my job except gossip from my co-workers.  I've learned so much more about life insurance working with Protective in 21/2 years than my previous job where I was there for 18 years."
good,The Protective Campus is beautiful with friendly employyees
good,Productive workplace. Enjoyed working with co-workers and my manager. I learned how to do multiple jobs to be backup to others. A typical workday is busy most days is busy and fast pace.
good,Protective is a good place to start your career. The managers are helpful with developing your skills and career. The employees can be supportive at times.
good,Cool place to work. Not alot of flexibility a basic 8am-5pm job. Management is okay. Protective needs to be up with the times of today work enviroment.
good,it is a great job for anyone who is young and want to grow with a company.  it is a dress casual place of business.  Friendly co workers and a good work place.

good,Nice place to work. Moved up fast. Good benefits with lots of PTO
good,Protective life is a great company in an exciting industry!  
good,A typical day would include speaking to multiple customers via telephone and email. Complex research was to be performed on a daily basis. Provided assistance to co-workers when needed.
good,"A typical day in the Binary section of the Print Shop included running a number of pieces of equipment such as the paper cutter, folder machine, scoring machine, as well as making deliveries to the main building. The work could be monotonous at times, but still fair pay for the type of work. The company was also large enough to offer good benefits including educational reimbursement, which I used to obtain an Electrical Engineering degree."
good,"Was a great work environment, especially for a recent college grad. There were many opportunities for career advancement and changes. I was given great benefits and PTO."
good,"Great culture with a sharp focus on customer service.  Technology was paramount in this organization, and software and hardware were kept relevant.  Many training opportunities were provided."
good,"Typical day consist of receiving calls to report the death of an insured, obtaining information to begin process of claim. Once information is received, processing claim, sending information to reinsurers to receive payment.  Payment is determined by the beneficiary and can be distributed as a retained asset, wire, or check.  Balancing all account each month.  Issuing 1099s."

good,Do your job well and you will be rewarded. Easy to get along with management. You feel the work you do makes a difference. Reviews are timely and in my experience fair.
good,"Protective is a place of growth and opportunity. When I started  5 years ago, I had limited knowledge regarding vehicle warranties and GAP insurances. Over the years I have gained much knowledge in that area.  From what is needed when purchasing a vehicle, and what constitute good coverage.  The management team is very approachable with the door always opened.  They keep open minded about new ideas and discoveries from employees,  Co workers are friendly and team players when it comes to tasks and ensuring things are done, Most enjoyable part of the job is the personal goals set and met."
good,"Company culture and environment is great. Managers work with you and want you to succeed. If you don't like sitting in a cubicle, this is not for you."
good,"I would like a position more inline with what I am in school for. I would also like to be challenged more in my position. A normal day at work consists of taking in-bound calls from contract holders, auto dealerships, and other clients. I manage many accounts and have to know the ins and outs of 1000's of contracts. I also solely manage the company's home warranty division. My co-workers are great and funny people, I have no issues with any of them. The only challenging part of work is dealing with irate customers from time to time. The most satisfying part of my job is turning a angry customer into a happy one."
good,"Great pay, good job. Large corporation so typical corporate management policies. Treat employees fairly. I did not feel there was any special treatment or favoritism. Job performance is the factor used in determining raises and promotions."
good,"I have learned new thirty party tools to monitor sql, ssis , ssrs and ssas jobs by using Control M and BIxPress tools."
good,Working here was so pleasant. There were so many people there that had worked over 20 years and rarely had anything negative say about a company and that says a lot.

good,"great company to work for,"
good,Quality management and seeasoned professionals contributed to a good work environment

good,This experiece was a quiet one the work was easy and the people was very nice.
good,"The morning starts with going to break room for hot chocolate. Once at my desk, I open up the systems that I use daily. During my day, I interact with Broker General Agents (BGA), clients and some FA's. I like the environment because I can work independent."

good,"Case review of client's data entry for open and closed cases"
good,"Protective is a great place to work for people who work hard. They are very willing to promote from within if you are willing to achieve your very best with specific deliverables.

good,"Business analysis, technology implementation in the Cincinnati Marketing and Sales office"
good,"Protective provides multiple opportunities to grow as an employee, from paid training, mentoring programs and regular work reviews.
