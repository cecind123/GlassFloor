bad,"Toxic management and chaotic team leadership. Lots of condescension and dissmissivness towards staff from management. Absolutely clueless about what's going on, and worst is when you're told what to do by someone with no real scientific background. Avoid working here."
bad,The worst experience I have had to date at any institution. The entire company is an organizational nightmare along with it's sad excuse for any sort of management.
bad,"Over hyped company due to rising stocks, poor management, stressful environment, learned absolutely nothing, coworkers all stressed out due to pressure, hardest part complete ignorance and arrogance of management"
bad,"The lack of respect some people have is ridiculous. The upper level admins schedule meetings based on their bosses availability and then they expect you to rearrange your schedule in order to accommodate. Including if you're supposed to meet a candidate, you're expected to rearrange the candidate's interview schedule. "
bad,Terrible working environment. There is no work life balance as they expect RA’s to do everything and get no credit. If you are not a favorite you will not move up. If you champion yourself you get blacklisted. The stress is not on par with they pay.
bad,"Extremely poor corporate culture involving HR and middle management.  Harassment and bullying were common in the group I worked in; middle management and HR rewarded and encouraged bad behavior.  Was asked by my supervisor on a number of occasions to do things that were clearly unethical.  Reporting multiple instances of misconduct to HR only made the problems worse.  Inept middle management and HR, cut-throat coworkers."
bad,Regeneron was a terrible place to work. The bosses are incompetent and unwilling to take responsibility for teaching or supervising in the labs. They use tempers employees as a scab covering the fact they cant keep anyone longer than a year or two.
bad,"I was working within the company for a sub contractor. I was approached by HR telling me to go for a temp  role in the warehouse(12 month contract) . I was apprehensive about taking the job as I have my wedding this year. My supervisor at the time was then approached by a member of senior management from the supply chain and warehouse dept who assured him that within six months we should be rolled over to FTE status. "
bad,The management within the department is petty and catty and wholly unprofessional. They do not care about the advancement of their employees or a work-life balance.
bad,"Harsh dysfunctional culture "
bad,"A rosey place for fresh outs.  For some reason , managers there think this is a continuation of college.  Layers and layers of titles with little results. No value for professionals. HR is terrible and is only concerned with recruitment activities at RPI (college). No respect for Mechanical engineers or Designers.  Devices are all purchased overseas by Regeneron's partner/ Sanofi.  Life Science majors are Project managers.  ME's wind up being lab techs, running data day after day from a fixture set up in the lab.  "
bad,"You have to be perfect in all that you do for this company, if you make a mistake it's your job that will be taken from you"
bad,"Company preaches work life balance but if you perform any less than perfection, and don't work 10-12 hours a day, and be on call 24/7, you get fired.  Rensselaer plant manager is a Lex Luther wannabe and puts the fear of God into every one, never mind that he is has legal troubles himself.  Company has no idea how to compete with the larger companies for new product launches and relies on their overseas partners to bail them out.  QA management is more focused on outside interests (horse stables) than putting in 8 hours of honest work.  CEO needs to survey IOPS employees to see why turnover is so high"
bad,"Horrible HR. Internal to HR, and in the eyes of the business."
bad,"Regeneron is a demanding site, with very difficult managers."
bad,"Start with the H/R department all the girl their knows us it’s a Fortune 500 company time she learns new words she was not their to make it a Fortune 500."
bad,I found myself experiencing racism. African Americans do not usually get hired permenantly. I was never comfortable. I always questioned job security. Treatment of individuals was based on race. Management was very unorganized.
bad,"Upper management is awful. They are top heavy with management vs hourly workers. Regeneron looks like a diamond from far away people fight to get in the door BUT if you do not fit into their ""click"" and ""drink the cool-aid"" you will never make it there. Basically, you do it their way or they will make you so miserable you leave on your own or they performance manage you out. It takes about 6 months get over the shock of how great the company is because they do ""a lot for employees"" and then you realize you have to sell your soul to fit in and if you don't do that you wont last long there."
bad,"They interviewed me for a job I was qualified for then put me into a different, high turnover position that I would not have wanted had I known more about it.  As a temp to perm employee, I was consistently treated as an outsider that didn't matter.  Abusive management was tolerated which I experienced and do not respect."
bad,It is a non supportive environment and very hostile management. I would not recommend it as a place to work. Best to find another place to work unless ou really need to work.
bad,"It's not good to be a contractor at this company because no one cares about you. Also, be very selective about your manager as many of them treat research associates like tools."
bad,"I was only promoted twice in 10 years, and through the ups and downs, as a minority female, I wasn't given the opportunities to grow as many of my caucasian peers. I was insulted alot for working really hard to find growth in new groups and different cross functional projects. It never seemed to work out for me, but for every single other person of color they seemed to share that same difficulty."
bad,Regeneron he reps are great at selling the company when they are making offers... But upon entering the group in which you work the forget very quickly who you are when questions and issues arise... Very very immature work force and very cliquey work environment...
bad,"The company does NOT design, nor make any hardware devices so don't be fooled by the title ""Device Development.  These device development jobs are actually only lab tech jobs, testing and putting on excel spreadsheets the results of the tests that OTHER COMPANIES make and Regeneron fills with drug product. So if you are truly a device development engineer, don't come here, you will be quickly disappointed. STAY AWAY."
bad,Was not provided with the things that I needed to be successful. Culture changed with growth and priorities shifted. Clicks were formed as full departments joined from other organizations.
bad,Leadership at Rensselaer site is bullying and lack of respect is demonstrated by site leadership starting at the top level.  Company growth pains are beyond what I expected and experienced at other companies.
bad,"The environment is very fast paced and unlike what is said, ideas are not welcome. This is a great place to start your career, the freebies handed out always keep the younger crowd engaged- such as seasonal parties, picnics, company parties, ice cream truck, and free food. They spend an abundant amount of money on shirts, useless company branded junk, and food. If you’re right out of college, all of this is great. They also act like free coffee is a privilege. The big boss is known to watch security footage of people working at IOPS and will call out those who don’t follow the rules. Either by odd email blasts, a random meeting or group text."
bad,"This place has gotten worse as we have continued to get bigger. Management is out of touch with its employees, upper management is always shinning a light on upper managers and never look to promote the R&D associates that actually get all the work done. Specifically in my group i feel that upper management feel that anyone is replaceable and that they view us as pipette monkeys."
bad,I was a contractual worker for a vacationing employee. The company was pleasure to learn skills in laboratory aide work. I was saddened when my assignment ended.
bad,"my 4 years working at REGN were educational, and when all is said and done, it did make me a better professional."
bad,"I do not share the Regeneron approach to validating automated pharmaceutical equipment. I feel that my experience and skills can be better served at an other company."
bad,"If you are just out of school come here!  If not, stay home!  Company favors the young and does little for seasoned professionals!  Managers tend to be in their 20's- 30's with no experince, so the older employees  have to train the majority of students there.  A lot of focus on employee training, but lack of program focus! BASIC   skills are not practiced, such as program management of individual projects, timing charts or deliverables, etc.  There are layers and layers of manager titles with little results from them.  Since it is a Pharmaceutical Company, there are many chemists and life science majors.  As a reward, they are promoted to Manager level and above. Since they are basically scientific in nature, they have No people skills and No management skills to run a department.  Hence the dilemma for seasoned professionals coming to work there!"
bad,"Executive VP talks constantly about Work-Life Balance, then has deadlines that trickle down. The only people that have a work life balance is manufacturing. IT has spent countless hours making sure manufacturing gets ping-pong, foosball, and air hockey tables, so they can live the dream of a Tech Start up, while the rest of the company busts their butt to make the fresh-out-of-college manufacturing dept happy. Executives have a zero tolerance for failure. You could work constant 80 hour weeks, but the second you make a mistake, you are judged on those merits, and are constantly in a stream of catching up, and being blamed for delays. IT Department used to have a great stream of people, but is now being replaced by contracts in India. Microbiology has an organization run by complete hacks, and the HR department is basically a cheerleader squad. Leaking info on people who have complaints, because they can't stop gossiping."
bad,"You wonder how a multi-billion dollar company can hire some of these people and stay afloat... Rampant favoritism/nepotism, consistent attempts by management to micromanage and make up for their incompetency, and a complete lack of trust and transparency. Everything other little bump in a project becomes a huge deal and is blown way out of proportion to the point where even minor things can't no longer be completed due to procedures. They will literally waste your time and their money due to over-restricting rules and incompetent people, but the company is more willing to spend so..."
bad,"The company is an example of the down side of upsizing; inefficiencies abound but if you are aggressive and smart you can do quite well.  If you are smart and innovation and have no problem asking/demanding  what you need or want, this is a good environment.  A typical day involves 50 e-mails (half of which require a response or review), at least 2 meetings and a lot of time managing the work of the CRO.  The hardest part of the job for me was having to seek out answers to processes and jumping in; it is hard to actually step on anyone's toes here."
bad,It's a job.  Nothing too great.  Management doesn't listen to employee concerns and they hire employees with bad HR history.  It was a good place to work but now everyone is a number
bad,"It truly is a good place to be treated like an adult when running your business.  In my experience, big pharma companies are so worried about reach and frequency and telling you what to say when you are facing a customer, Regeneron treats you like an adult in this regard and does not do this as of now."
bad,"Poor management, no job advancement, poor culture, happy hours, parties but no professional growth. Constant change in plans, no planning, not so collaborative culture."
bad,"Regeneron is a pleasant place to work as long as you can pass their daily SOPs test that they perform. The moment you fail one, will be the moment you'll be released for your job/unemployed. "
good,"The Tarrytown facility news attracts you to the company but the Rensealler site is very different. They still operate as if they were 150 employee company. There is very dirty politics in QC, QA and Operations area. There is so much redundancy in all activities. On the flip side, the company environment is very relaxed. There are many activities making your day to day work very interesting. Company sponsored events and parties are good. Regneron has by far the best IT teams and excellent training program for new employees."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Pay isn’t terrible, hours aren’t bad. But the satisfaction isn’t there at the end of the day. This place is just a paycheck for me."
good,"Not a  bad place to work. It can be difficult to balance work/ life."
good,The company has really struggled in migrating from academic company to multi-billion big Bio-pharma. There is significant organizational design issues and complete lack of communication with employees
good,Lots of micro managing done. Some of the executives are too stressed to care about their direct reports. They are more into policy than people. Very rigid managers.
good,"I learned a vast amount about biotechnology and was introduced to the complexities of the pharmaceutical industry and the many steps involved in its' success.  The most enjoyable part of the job was  being challenged each day and learning something new every day.  I personally embraced learning as much as I could about this fascinating business. Extreme improvements are necessary in the HR Department and proper skills and training are necessary for managers in order to consistently and successfully interact with subordinates as fellow employees with the same goal of company success in mind.  The intended company culture is often not practiced or encouraged in each department.  Overall, the employees were friendly."
good,This position is a new role and wasn't defined.  I worked with many different study team members and learned a great deal. It was a good opportunity for my professional development.
good,"No team environment "
good,"Some departments are deteriorating faster than others. Just ask the turnover rate and you will see.  Management pick favorites. you better in the right camp, otherwise you have no chance of surviving. There is not much choices around this area for pharma work here, better to find a job in boston/bay area/NJ."
good,Regeneron is a Clinical Research powerhouse.  If you are in the Clinical Development departments then the world is your oyster.  I would say that the Regeneron Genome division will be an organization to watch.
good,"This company is a great place to work unless you are getting into manufacturing.   "
good,Not much opportunity for growth or career advancement if you had been there for a long time and proven yourself.
good,"There are opportunities to move between departments which is great, but overall promotion process lacks visibility. Location is not great, but campus is nice."
good,Good place to work they expect a lot out of you.  Management needs to be improved and you have to watch what you say to one an other. They tell one thing in meetings and do something different after the meetings.
good,Company has a strong pipeline so the clinical teams are working long long hours. Very high turnover rate because most people are burned out. The products have a lot of competition so not sure how the stock will fare in the future.
good,This company offers good compensation.  The managers are there to help you improve your knowledge and become a better employee.  I did not like my schedule.
good,"Very busy, very fast paced. The problem was that more work to do then could ever be done in a 40 or even 45 hour work week. So either you worked 50 plus hours a week or fell behind in your work."
good,"The experience you'll have at Regeneron will depend on the position you have at the company.  If you are in a core function of the company, there is a good chance you'll have positive impression of the company, work 9-5, and get to enjoy the perks the company offers.  If you work in a therapeutic focus area, there is less of a chance you'll find your stay enjoyable.  You'll routinely work more than the 8 hours salaried with no overtime.  Weekend work is not uncommon.  The ceiling is relatively low for researchers unless you go on the scientist track or management track.  Promotions are relatively few and far between as well.  About two to four per year per department."
good,The CEO is not supportive of growing the Access & Reimbursement division for their pipeline of products. The most enjoyable part of the job is implementing strategic processes in order for patients to have immediate access to therapy.
good,Regeneron proves to be the exception in the stigma riddled industry of pharmaceuticals.  My experience would have been better if I had joined with a greater level of education.
good,"Great biotech company based in Tarrytown, NY "
good,"•	Sample analysis utilizing ligand binding bioassays (ELISA and MSD assays) "
good,A typical work day are many asks in the am on open items that need solution to drive it across th finish line but yet having fun doing it with intelligent people.
good,Regeneron believes in the power of original thinking. The company is built on breakthrough ideas and innovations; which is why Regeneron fosters a spirit of openness and strive to inspire from within. The company is collaborative by design and driven by curiosity. All Regeneron employees contribute an active role in transforming people’s lives through their work. Regeneron’s Community form a solid group working together to change the world.
good,"The environment is fast paced.  There is alot to do and learn.  At times you are moving faster than the speed of light, which can be concerning because it does not allow for learning and time to process the task at hand.  It's time to work a bit smarter to ensure that work life balance and the quantity of the documents are not subpar."
good,"manufacturing management doesn't have enough managerial experience. The company grew so rapidly and its hard for them to keep up. The company also has ""punishments"" which makes you feel like youre in grade school"
good,"Cleaning and organizing rooms for conferences "
good,People focus more on whether or not they like you versus the quality of work done. Management was not compatible with the rest of the team.
good,My position was not typical. 
good,"Great place to work with loads of campus offerings life free coffee and corporate parties for the employees."
good,It's a good company to work for with great benefits and many smart and helpful people. Good culture and many fun events throughout the year. Managers can do a better job.
good,"Regeneron could be a dream job, If management would make choices to favor their employees.  This is their greatest challenge:  you don't know when you will be out."
good,Regeneron provides fair compensation and benefits. The overall working atmosphere is friendly and cheerful. The politics within management sometimes could be discouraging though.
good,"great experience, cutting edge science and manufacturing. Able to cross train and expand skill sets easily. Good co workers and company. Work life balance could be better."
good,You need to work there to experience it. Once could write chapter upon chapter of what makes Regeneron such a unique place to work. It is a global company with a robust pipeline of therapeutic drugs to help patients.
good,"IOPS successfully manufactures a range of biopharmaceuticals for patients worldwide, including our approved therapeutic proteins and those involved in clinical studies."
good,"As is the nature of manufacturing, days can be long and harsh. Overall though, the experience with Regeneron is a positive one. They do their best to give you proper benefits and there is always overtime available. You will not come out of Regeneron lacking experience in any of the industry standards. If you're looking for a first job, Regeneron is a great place to work."
good,"The work here is fast paced and from what I hear more intensive than other companies. For most people, the science is very important. However, there are some growing pains experienced within the company."
good,"Family oriented place where your accomplishments and milestones are celebrated, hard work is recognized and above all a common drive to help improve the health and lives of others. Regeneron is a diverse workplace that celebrates all walks of life."
good,I gained a tremendous amount of experience working at Regeneron and was given a lot of responsibility with a sensitive product.  I had some terrific co-workers and developed a great rapport with them which was important not only for the daily work environment but for the pace of our job to get the product packaged and out the door-my team member and I worked together very well.  The pace could be very demanding at times but he and I pulled together.
good,"As being a beginner, i learned a lot from the company. coworkers were helpful and made job interesting and challenging."
good,"Certain departments don't function well. My job duties have increased significantly as expected, but with very little guidance. Promotions aren't performance based, they are time based."
good,"Territories vary greatly in size, some are huge and others not bad. Salary is all over the map.  Bonus structure changes every quarter.  Samples are non-existent.  Resources have dried up. Enjoy selling my product, but be prepared to have to fight to get each and every patient through insurance system. None of this comes easily. "
good,"The travel was the most difficult part for me.  Had I lived closer or my commute been easier I would have enjoyed it much more, but I was commuting from NJ to Sleepy Hollow via public transit and that left very little time for any life outside of work."
good,"Very interesting place to work.  They pride themselves on being progressing and keeping up with the ""Googles and Apples"" of the world; however it is very hard to make things happen there unless you're an associate manager or above.  Very political.  Always seeking to find the holes in plans and thoughts."
good,Company that cares about the well being of their people. If you have an idea to improve your group or department it's encouraged. Good culture and great people.
good,Regeneron is an emerging Pharmaceutical company that is continuously growing and a great opportunity for young new scientists to join. They have good benefits and are working hard to improve peoples lives.
good,I like the company. You will work hard and it will be stressful. The company is young in the sense that most managers are 20's- early 30's in manufacturing at least. Burn out is often encountered because shifts are 4x10's. QA can be a pain to deal with. Other then that great company and you will learn a lot.
good,"exciting fast paced super clean modern facility, great  working with intelligent people where I learn quiet quickly and management are helpful and approachable"
good,"It was a great place to work until bad management moved in. Lots of Learning opportunities, great co-workers. In short it was a nice place to work for."
good,Nice people to work with; well pay; family environment; science driven;
good,A typical day can bring anything from A to Z in terms of problems encounter and solutions.
good,"Regeneron is a great company, the culture was great when we started and has continued to be solid. One of the challenges we faced, is a growing commercial organization that makes it tough to advance and grow from within. Many times they look outside of the organization, as opposed to offering opportunities to current employees with strong track records of success."
good,"Wonderful place to work with room for advancement, however salary will not allow you to live close to working location. There are perks and discounts however, the salary needs to be raised."
good,"The goal of this project is to design a portal for managing the access to several databases on a grid through a single sign-on facility. The user, typically a scientist interested in computations that depends on data from several data sources, will access this database from a web browser. The system should use grid computing standards to fetch data from the different data sources."
good,"Contract role in the company's Clinical Finance area.  Team is solid, pay is fair, and work is satisfying and challenging.  I came in for a roughly 3 month period to help out while team members were out on leave."
good,"I learned a lot at my job every single day ,I learned new technology, including cell biology, immunology, etc, I also learned how to be a good team player, how to help each other."
good,"This company is a great place for young professionals to come if its their first internship experience or if they have had an internship before, and the working environment is very friendly."
good,"Offered a lot of opportunities for exposure in various safety-related areas. Many very nice people. A lot of young professionals working in the research areas. Attempts are made to be more of a ""Google"" company but this is more for the researchers, not for Facilities employees."
good,"A typical day at work consists of data entry pertaining to all types of various new hires. Communicating with the actual candidates via email and telephone. Reporting to superiors regarding data entry."
good,"There are nice benefits with this company. They offer free breakfasts on Friday, fun events in the summer to learn about different organizations within the company and a general enjoyable attitude among most of the employees. Voted number 1 place to work many times by Science Magazine for a reason."
good,"Changing priorities, science based, GMP enviornment, hard work, great people."
good,My experience at Regeneron was very good. The scientific advancements are helping the lives of many people. I do not choose to make a further comment at this time
good,"Laid back and casual, but people take their work seriously. Lots of cool opportunities, events, and people. I can only speak for the internship experience, but it was a fantastic one with many skills developed and connections formed."
good,Regeneron is very good to their employees. Unfortunately the upstate facility near Albany is located in an area that sucks.  Management sometimes makes work harder than it needs to be
good,"Much is expected of you as an employee, but you will be well compensated.  Regeneron fosters a healthy work environment, with many perks, and the company works hard to prevent siloing between departments.  However, the work/life balance needs improvement."
good,"Currently working at Regeneron as a temp employee. There are lots of pros of working here. There are a lot of free stuff, no dress code, relaxed culture,"
good,"This is a great place to work if you are in the correct department. They have a great culture, and provide either employees with a ton of benefits. Overall this is a great place to work"
good,"hard working job with great benefits and incentives. I learned that you can't REALLY trust people that you work with especially when you find yourself doing more then your share and they get you fired to take the heat off of them. as far as the atmosphere at work was good, alot of friendly people but then when your thrown under the bus. it doesnt matter how much work you put in."
good,Regeneron is a great place to work and offers a welcoming and helpful environment to help new employees adjust smoothly. My job at Regeneron was a great learning experience for me and gave me insight into how a pharmaceutical company functions as a whole. My coworkers were very accommodating in helping me train for my job duties.
good,We are a quick paced company receiving hundreds of packages a day.We then deliver all the packages to scientist and research associates.Nice friendly people are rampant here.
good,"Overall, this is a good company to work for and there are so many career opportunities.  "
good,"Good company, smart CEO and R&D crew. Some growing pain. Promotions are quick. Learned great deal about good science. The culture is good and your voice is listened to."
good,"Regeneron is a good company to work for, flexible atmosphere and they do not micro manage employees.  Are willing to train and guide employees as needed."
good,It's an amazing company with amazing people to work with. A lot of learning on the job and people always there to help you. Internship program is probably the best I have ever come across.
good,"Positive, Positive, The culture was good. However their should be better management when an issue arise. Mentorship was helpful and insightful; and the learning curve is very slim. Good place to work."
good,"Depends on where you are in your career, but does offer some advancement. Leveling is not consistent, causing dissension among the ranks. Company may have peaked."
good,Very productive. Definitely focused on employee engagement . Team oriented and googlesque campus. All amenities available for success. Science is key.
good,"Regeneron is a highly competitive place to work, with changes constantly around you. You have to keep up with the daily mess, but they often provide amenities for such stressors, such as free coffee and think spaces."
good,Worked there as a temp but it is a nice environment to be in. Company really cares about their employees but at the same time needs to get better management that will 'run a tighter ship'.  They also need to be more open to changed and not stuck in their ways.
good,"Embraced new challenges with the team everyday, ever changing and growing work environment, knowledgeable about the product, placed the clients first at all times"
good,Regeneron has a great culture and is great place to work.  The management is very concerned about the employees.  The company offers a wide range of benefits to meet most employee needs.
good,very good place to work
good,"It was a lovely place to work, with really nice people. Gained valuable experience. Wages and benefits were good. Shift pattern was very hard on the body and could do with more resources."
good,The company has great health benefits and great job security. The company makes sure employees receive good health care benefits. The company does provide fair compensation as well.
good,"Regeneron was a great company to work for. The company's culture was first class. Coworkers were a pleasure to work with and thought me a lot about how to work both on a team and by myself. While there were days when I felt that I barely had time to eat lunch due to the busy schedule, working at Regeneron was a great experience."
good,Expectations are high and the pace is set very fast.  Management offers many benefit s to keep people happy to be working long hours.  Great perks and compensation.
good,A great place to work! The benefits are great and they really try to hear from everyone. The company is getting very big. Which is a good thing also! I highly recommend Regeneron
good,Great place to start out anyone looking to break into the industry. There is room for growth.
good,I loved working for this company-  they value their employees.  They have a scientific focus and truly care about the patients they serve. They compensate their employees well and provide great benefits.
good,"Cares about employees, puts patients first, has good values that employees believe in, lots of perks, great benefits, casual attire, work/life balance struggles"
good,As just a co-op I was given far more responsibility and opportunities to learn than I was expecting. I found the overall experience was enjoyable and completely beneficial.
good,"great culture, amazing place to work. It is a place where there are lots of opportunities to learn about the science world as well as the finance world.  Management emphasizes on culture and they also have the latest technology available for employees."
good,"I was introduced to a company that started in a loft by two scientists. The lifestyle of the company was very relaxed, yet super professional. High standards were set for every position in the company and there many online courses that had to be completed in order to maintain that level of professionalism. I had learned to comply with many rules and learned how to work with people on all levels of the company, from the labs to the offices. The culture of the company made it easy to meet everyone and network. It allowed room for growth and development. The only downside was the amount of pressure to be exceptional."
good,Good environment for intern and excellent location right outside the city. Plenty of programs for interns and also lots of support from the employees and a lot of fun overall. Cool company overall and learned a lot about the pharma industry and also about fda approval process.
good,A growing company with lot of opportunities for fresh graduates and experienced candidates.
good,"I really enjoy being at regeneron, the staff is very nice, and open. I have learned a lot so far and it seems like a place I could grow at. There are many opportunities for continuing education and i constantly feel like I am seeing new things and doing what I went to school to do."
good,Great company with great culture. Loved working here and look forward to future opportunities. I worked as an intern and felt like I had the same responsibilities as a full-time employee.
good,"Fun, work place with supportive management. Very warm, loke family in the office. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Regeneron cares about the well being of their people. We get barbecues, breakfast every Friday, a decent holiday party every year and the week after Christmas off. If you have an idea to improve your group or department it's encouraged. Plenty of room to grow as you gain experience."
good,Working for Regeneron is a great opportunity to learn how the pharma industry works.  Inspection ready at all times if the key. Good co workers and benefits.
good,Its so much to write please refer to my resume. In a nut shell the culture here is great! The atmosphere is awesome! Time flies when you work here. The hardest part is how busy we are but I love it. The best part of my job is candidate interaction!
good,"Company is great for experience and growth. Offers great benefits and opportunity to learn. "
good,"Energetic, youthful environment filled with people who are motivated to make a difference in the lives of patients.The company has a lot of future potential."
good,"The culture of the company is fun and inclusive. There are enough celebrations and parties throughout the year to not let you complain. The company tries to provide information about all aspects of work done around the company and keep employees informed of the BLA submissions to litigations, etc. There are not many avenues of career growth at Regeneron. There are too many levels of management."
good,"I have worked at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for 3 years in the manufacturing department. The company is growing very quickly, has a very healthy culture, and is relatively flexible to the needs and wants of its workforce. They go out of their way to do numerous small events such as bringing ice cream trucks to the employees, and hosting some enjoyable year end holiday parties. I have greatly enjoyed my time working here, and consider myself fortunate to have started right after college. "
good,Highly recommend. Superior employee benefits. Great employee appreciation. Very transparent company. Management is great but not always helpful in developing their reports. Truly a work hard play hard(er) company. Very receptive of employee feedback.
good,Regeneron has been such a great experience in my career growth. I get the chance to work with some very intelligent & kind people. Definitely a learning experience.
good,"As an intern at Regeneron, I found it to be a great place to work and get experience in the pharmaceutical industry."
good,"We are dedicated to helping the lives of other people. To do this, we all have to work with total commitment and dedication to getting drugs to those who need them. Everyone works hard,"
good,"I enjoyed my time here and still miss my coworkers.  Wonderful experience.  They were accommodating, fair, helpful and professional.  This is a highly demanding place of excellence."
good,I highly recommend it. Good company with good people. They focus on the science more than on the business and care about patients. The work is rewarding and challenging.
good,"-Overall a great place to work with the only issue being in that management often cherry picks people for management roles. Not picking those who are most deserving, but those who fall in line with those in front of them. Also its weird how many of the upper management people are married to each other."
good,"Typical day at work would be running everyday reports and working on various projects such as SOB, Order Management, Inventory Reporting. Also, any updates to templates or queries as deemed necessary in order to maintain accuracy of reporting figures. I learned how to better multi-task and take on various projects. Learned a high level understanding of how the inventory procedure functions. Management is very supportive and will take time to help if something seems unclear. The hardest part of the job was learning a brand new industry to which I was not familiar with and the most enjoyable part of the job was team building events."
good,Overall Regeneron is a great company to work for.  They have great benefits and the people are relatively great to work with.  One downside is it is hard to transfer from one department to the another.  Would be great if could work from home occasionally but that is dependent on department and managers.
good,"Great place to work! Products are top notch. Incorporates all aspects of a biological sale, total office calls. Introduction to new products and access to products."
good,"great people, i was well taught well, very interesting work and tons of extra benifits"
good,"Excellent company ethos, Patient Focused."
good,"Awesome benefits, perks and great pay are provided/offered within the company. They are pretty laid back and not micro-managing. Employees are pretty happy for the most part but can be very demanding which can be a task. Everyone gets whatever they want as far as I.T. equipment is concerned. Take home equipment is practically provided to anyone that asks. Working with some or most of the Regeneron folks was awesome!"
good,"Great place to work! Fast paced, challenging environment. "
good,"I have been working at Regeneron for 1 year and love the company! You are respected and valued by the company and they continually show you...from free coffee labs, incredible company holiday celebrations - Spring Fling, Summer Festival , Octoberfest... The work is not easy, there is so much to do - but our future is bright and our pipeline strong.  If you get the chance to interview - do it!  You won't regret your choice. You are treated as an adult and allowed to determine your work from home schedule..."
good,"The company is professional that you can feel from their human resource and IT support teams, the culture here encourage creativeness. However, as a biology company, it focus on bio issues more than machine learning modeling improvement, it's good for the company but a limit for my own career advancement, therefore I didn't continue after the internship."
good,Have the best Manager and team! Very professional work environment and extremely friendly and helpful people! Flexible work hours. I will miss this place a lot after my contract comes to an end.

good,Regeneron is a great place to work. The culture is the best thing about the company as everyone has the same goals. Manufacturing wears many hats at the company therefore its a very busy job from day to do. There are great benefits at the company!
good,"Good intern experience, great company. Love the culture and enthusiasm. Regeneron is a great place. Day to day as an intern included helping out any way I could"
good,"Regeneron is an excellent company to work for. There is plenty of room for vertical and horizontal movement to find the role most suited for your skill set. I felt like the work I was doing had a direct impact on the well-being of people around the globe. Regeneron treats its employees well and I feel like the management genuinely cares about each person as an individual. Being in the Clinical Manufacturing Department allowed me to learn about various aspects of the clinical drug making process, along with allowing me to grow professionally. The culture here is work hard play hard, and is not for everyone. This was the hardest part of the job as the work/life balance was virtually non-existent."
good,"This is one of the best places that I have ever worked. I truly enjoyed working with the teams!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the people. Everyone there is so friendly and intelligent. My role was easy. On days that were slow we were encouraged to visit areas and talk to employees that had roles related to our majors in college.
good,"Working at Regeneron is great, they provide a very great environment to work in and really take into account employee feedback. They are ranked as one of the greatest places to work for many reasons, for me it was due to the inclusiveness I felt by working with the company and my day-to-day coworkers."
good,"Everyday there was a new job to be done, outstanding and very clean environment, people very kind and friendly. Great Leadership. Always having picnics, parties and giveaways."
good,Large company with several drugs on the market. Clinical Operations was a great department to work in.
good,They were extremely attentive to employees and provided many perks to encourage employees while at work. They are very dedicated to following GMP and GLP practices and doing things the right way the first time. This was very nice to know as an employee because the vision is to create medicine for someone's mother or uncle or child. They really enforced that this medicine has to be made with the best techniques and morals to be able to give it to patients.
good,"Have had two very successful award winning opportunities to work with two Biotech companies....Cephalon and Regeneron. "

If you have an idea to improve your group or department it's encouraged. Plenty of room to grow as you gain experience."
