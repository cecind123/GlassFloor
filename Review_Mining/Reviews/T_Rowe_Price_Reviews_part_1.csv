bad,"This job was very stressful and you have no job-life balance. The expectations are not realistic and you have very little support from leadership."
bad,Cruddy pay & benefits. Cruddy systems and the training preps you for pretty much nothing... Tons of MANDATORY OT and angry clients. No support from mgmt. Favoritism is rampant. Company is way behind the times. They make it impossible to actually help a client -- internal systems are always down and the website is not user friendly. Need a bunch of forms from client to do anything and processing team usually rejects it over the dumbest reasons -- that is absolutely ludicrous. The turnover rate of people quitting and getting fired was terrifying! They have $1 trillion in assets under mgmt but I have no idea how...90% of my calls were clients transferring assets away from T Rowe because they were fed up with the company! Half of my hiring class had left before we were on the floor for a month...There are plenty of other firms that are more suitable to work for. T Rowe will diminish your soul and amp up your anxiety.
bad,"I spent many years fighting for my place in a company where your gender and who you know is actually what matters. "
bad,Everything about this place is terrible. They will fire you on the spot with no warning. Extremely repetitive and boring job. Nothing technical about the helpdesk position. The only technical assistance you will be doing is password resets and browser troubleshooting.
bad,Very friendly atmosphere to work in.  Great cafeteria.  Great work place environment.  Friendly co-workers.  Great work hours. Great management. Clean Facilities.
bad,"It was run by a bunch of losers that did things the ""TRP way"" and never deviated from the norm for best practices. "
bad,I didn't enjoy my time here.  Success seemed to be based on being a social butterfly and pleasing everyone all the time.  When i look to the supervisors and managers that have been here a while they ALL look burnt out.  Not hard to see why.
bad,"Not a job for the person who puts family first, which is why the average employee is less than 25 years old. Overtime is mandatory and often demanded at the last minute."
bad,"techs are disposable and changed out every six months.Theres nothing you can do to keep this job.  When it slows down after tax season, they will let you go."
bad,OVERWORKED ! UNDERPAID!  Working here is a joke. They rope u in with all these promises and they tell you will learn about investing. They train you for two months only to have you get on the phones and unlock peoples online account passwords. Learning about mutual funds means nothing if you spend the day helping people trouble shoot their online passwords. Sounds like a job for IT or the help desk but it was forced on the reps in RIS. OVertime was frequent and sometimes there was not an advanced notice. That is very incosiderate. the turnover rate is extremly high. I was only there for a short time and I saw 3 managers come and leave the department. dont get roped in. T Rowe Price isnt all they say it is. 
bad,"Management is only concerned about the bottom line for stockholders. Implements unrealistic quality numbers for production. When you have more than 75% of your department on Performance plans, there is a problem. Management drives younger workers into management positions with no experience and burns them out within a year."
bad,"Nepotism.....be friends with the current supervisor to become the new supervisor when that person move on..... doesn't mean I have to be the best for the job, but I kissed enough a** type culture!"
bad,The home office seems diverse and full of opportunities. The Colorado office lacks significant diversity and it shows. The leadership lacks morals and integrity and it rolls down to employees. As a trainer I was told to hey rid of people fast before it gets too hard after they are trained. Leadership is self deserving. Employee turnover is at an all time high. Huge pay gaps.
bad,"The HR department is terrible at following the code of ethics as written in the employee handbook.  They allow team members to be harassed by their co-workers and managers with no repercussions.  They promote workplace hostility by violating your confidentiality when you do file a complaint against a co-worker.  "
bad,"This place is very bad.  All supervisors are young and never done it before.  They micro manage and have no clue as to how to do the job.  They discriminate against older people.  They do not promote on merit, it's who they like...reminded me of high school politics. They lie to you and expect you to take it with a smile.  If you speak up for yourself you get black listed and retaliated on."
bad,"if you have little to no work experience this place is good.  If you want a career change, this place is good.  if you are older avoid this place, they do not value outside experience.  everyone in management is young and in most cases their first run at it."
bad,"Worked at TRP in the RAM dept. for almost two years. Benefits were good but pay was not. Was told would not get a bonus the week before Christmas because I received a promotion earlier in the year. The promotion I earned was my bonus. Continued to add more complex work and responsibilities with no additional pay; in addition to adding more work,  they reduced our handle time in half. Almost no one could reach the ridiculous metrics, so you had to worry about being put on a performance improvement plan or losing your job. Lots of OT; worked 55 plus hours a week for four months straight. Management did a horrible job at staffing. People were leaving all the time-the culture and morale were terrible the last 6 months I was there. Worked the employees remaining into the ground-hey, but we got free pizza some OT nights. Maybe they could have allocated some money for addl employees.   Took 4 or more years to move up or out of RAM. even for the top performers in our department. Advancement opportunities were limited. Wouldn't recommend working or investing with TRP."
bad,I did not enjoy my time in RIS or PSG. You will work nonstop 8-6:30 every day and you are only allowed two breaks. This position required handling non-stop calls and there is little support from management. I was promoted to PSG where call volumes are lower but situations are more complex. I was also lied to when I was hired about taking the finra exams. Do not recommend.
bad,"In my department in plan race and weakness plays a big part of your day today.  I was accused of being a drug dealer because of my ""high-end clothes and car"" and I was told to seperate from the black people i started training with."
bad,"Culture of discrimination"
bad,"If you are part of the in crowd it is great, but the culture resembles that of the movie ""Mean Girls' jokes about being old or ancient than younger employees are common from the managers who are mostly 30 something."
bad,The time i spent employed with t rowe price were miserable to say the least . Management does not respect not appreciate the employees. Alot of favorites and not enough leaders
bad,The entire company is a scam. They get involved in your personal business which has nothing to do with your job duties. They work you like a dog until they no longer need you and the whole thing about being a diverse company is BS!!! I feel that the company is racist to a degree.
bad,"average place to work "
bad,out dated policies and unmotivated staff. they constantly are breaking anti discrimination laws and laugh about it. horrible environment and even worse culture. I d mot miss one min of working in this uncle sam corp.i dont have any more to say i hope this is the last sentence i have to write
bad,RAM dept over works you and people always call out because it’s stressful. They do not pay enough for what the work is and expect you to work overtime all the time and they don’t care about family. Supervisors lie to make themselves look good but don’t even know how to proper assist with and questions you have. Just don’t apply for a client service position
bad,Management not effective. Prefer not work in this environment. Limited advancement no ongoing training provided. Peers are good to work with.
bad,"This was the worst work experience in all my years of employment. The Baltimore location is simply a joke. The Sr. Admins are all ""Stepford Wives"" for the PMs & Analyst. They have absolutely no voice. The Admin Supervisors do not support their assigned Admins at all.  The PMs and Analyst are disrespectful and very uncaring. You're not recognized for ""a job well done"". It's basically, their way or the highway."
bad,"Help Desk full of Contractors trying to earn limited full Time spot. Environment is a little cut throat, with employees trying to throw others under the bus for a full time position that isn't available. They find reasons to get rid of contractors, so that they don't make it to the two-year mark and HAVE to hire that employee full time."
bad,Work is very repetitive and mundane; Some Associates are nice depending on who you support. But you report to an Administrative Manager and they are clueless about what you do and they don't have your best interest in mind. They will move you without notice.    Turnover is very high and the pay is not great.
bad,"Baltimore City's site is more favorable towards contractors.  if you are not an FTE at this site or Owings Mills, this job will not be the best place for you.  Contractors are treated unfairly in the operational-Owings Mills site."
bad,Going to work every Monday made me want to turn around and go home. Comp was on par but it was a stuffy and political culture. No room for advancement. Mid mgmt will be there forever
bad,"I would have expected more from a company like TRP, but they came across as very disorganized and unfocused.  Did not feel like I received the appropriate training for the responsibilities I was expected to perform and their metric system for evaluating your performance is questionable at best.  Could easily be argued that it not only puts unneeded stress on the employee attempting to handle calls but also create an uncomfortable and unfriendly customer experience since you had to be focused on how long you were on each call as that was one of the parameters used to judge your performance.  When questions arose with having an issue unsure of how to assist the customer it was very difficult or sometimes impossible to find someone that was more experienced to provide you with some guidance at the very least."
bad,"While they are trying to morph into a next generation company, they have a hands off ""ivory tower"" PMO - all systems are stove piped - quality control is piecemeal - like many companies, their path to the future is to fire the current staff. Hiring lots of contractors for big jobs / projects because they can't do it themselves & need to get rid of people so they can afford the new technology"
bad,"Various teams for the multiple platforms are not accustomed to working together.  Each team did their own project management which was not conducted in a consistent manner.  The EPMO was not considered to be an integral park of the project, which caused confusion and lack of accountability.  "
bad,Overtime is mandatory and unannounced. Expectations are often unclear and much is required for work that is regarded very little by other employers. Work is extremely time sensitive
bad,"Overtime overtime overtime, the people running this department don't use logic or common sense. They let go half the department who can't obtain a series 6, and 63 licenses but don't replace them. Meanwhile, calls are increased and mandatory overtime is getting scheduled. Working ten hour days with 30-minute lunches and getting watched like a hawk if you log off the phone. This is pure call center horrible I wouldn't recommend anyone coming to work for this department it was the worst time of my life here. Everyone is throwing everyone under the bus in order to move ahead, whatever you do, do not apply for financial services group or any phone group. You will be stuck in the position after your year is up"
bad,"The job is a great learning experience, but the excitement of working for TRP quickly loses its luster.  RAM is severely short-staffed, overworked, and ridiculously underpaid, supervisors are just as frustrated as the associates, and leadership is great about putting up a caring front without taking any real action and providing effective solutions."
bad,"From my perspective, it seemed the only avenue to promotion into leadership was to be a part of the crony crew. Most members of general management were very close friends, in some cases connections dating back to High School. Promotions seemed to be honored based on friendships and not previous professional experience or true talent.  Friendships and being a part of crony club should not be a compelling reason to promote an individual. These high school antics have contributed to my decision to seek employment in a professional environment, where promotions are based on merit and not likeability or one's ability to mesh with a homogenous group."
bad,"TRowePrice is a great company, unless you are in one of the customer service departments. They don't care about you as a person, just another person to answer calls. Advancement is very slim as they have only a few ""full-time"" slots that do not open often. Pay is ok, lower than average. You will work holidays, even if the rest of the company is closed (full-time and supervisors won't come in) because you're a contractor."
bad,"the jobs are repetitive enough that you can listen to  podcast and watch netflix, the hardest part of the job was realizing their was no upward path from my position."
bad,"Amenities on site are very nice. There is a great cafeteria and a decent gym. The insurance benefits are quite good as well."
bad,"This is a typical call center. You take between 50-70 calls per day and your time is tracked from the moment you enter the office to the time you leave. If you are looking for a financial service position where you actually learn and are developed as an associate, this is not the position for you. There is also mandatory overtime, so if you cannot handle an additional two hours of overtime each day, you should not apply for the position. Finally, if you are not a great test taker or you do not believe in your capabilities to obtain two licenses in about 6 weeks time, do not apply. If you cannot pass the exams you will be fired."
bad,My time at TRP was interesting. Very demanding yet pay was not comparable to the amount of time and work put into the position. Very uptight environment.
bad,"2 1/2 year at T Rowe Price:"
bad,"Company has 2 sides : retirement Plans (401k) & retail services: (IRA, non company sponsored Accts, etc)  both share 1 site however, culture & management influences make it seem like 2 very different companies.  You will be over worked, under appreciated, & under paid UNLESS you fit in with the management fraternity club.  At road shows VP's will preach one thing but don't dare attempt to implement any or bring it up to middle management, it's taboo.  Middle management from the GM's down have a frat club, upper management from the DM's down have no clue about the trenches & don't want one.  They preach ""the client""  but reallly mean ""the business... So the messages are coded & hypocritical... You need to hear thank you for your hard work... Look to co-workers because in any & all coachings or 1x1's you will hear every tiny little thing the can find to deride you (per six sigma) & nothing you did well, even if you cosistently exceed matrix...don't trust a Sup as far as you can throw them, most are back stabbing, phoney, & looking out for their own..."
bad,I majored in business administration in college and went from a teaching career to T Rowe Price to learn more about business. I did not feel like I was given what I needed to succeed coming from a background that was not solely financial.
bad,"I absolutely loved my coworkers, the role, and the benefits.  What made it unbearable to work there was having a manager who felt that your job should come ahead of anything else. Because SHE was willing to forfeit time with her family the expectation was that you would as well. If you are single this is a great job.  If you have a family, don't expect them to care."
bad,"Some what productive. Lots of sneaky activities such as illegal betting, and numbers running.  when mentioned, since I was a temp, assignment was terminated after I trained my successor"
bad,"When I first started here it seem like this company had so many opportunities. They gave the appearance they were a smooth moving machine. When you get out of training you quickly realize this isn't true. The supervisors disappear constantly, come in late, leave early and are not supportive. There are some that seem dedicated and supportive but the default is the disengaged one's that have been there longer. Departments have no communication between each other or lie so they won't have to take a call. They close down one of their centers then put on ten hours of overtime a week. They ask too much from the employees for the lack of support they give them. But no one will say anything due to fear of retaliation."
good,"I had a terrible experience working at T. Rowe inspite of working there for 8 years.  I would never go back and I would only recommend them if the applicant is desparate because they'll take anybody.  They do not pay well, they micromanage their employees to death and their culture is a far cry from what they would like their shareholders to believe it is."
good,"The company was great to work for. The management was lacking in experience, knowledge, and availability. They would spend most time away in meetings or on u-tube and couldn’t answer technical questions. "
good,"When I first started working at T. Rowe Price, work life balance was great.  There was very little overtime required.  Since the company has grown over the years and (unnecessary) changes were made to some departments, this has caused a dramatic increase in the overtime and the lack of work life balance.  Now we never know when we will get off of work.  Because of that, it's difficult to make any plans unless it's only on the weekends.  Also the company has gone to a model of having smaller departments which results in less employees to do more work.  To make matters worse, now you basically have to kill yourself to get a raise or bonus.  I can say that the moral has reached an all time low in certain departments.  On a positive note the benefits are great.  We get medical, dental, and vision insurance.  Paid leave for surgery, mental illness, and maternity/paternity leave."
good,T. Rowe Price is very customer driven but they don't treat their employees very well. The majority of the helpdesk are contractors and aren't treated with the same benefits that full time associates have. There is a lot of micro-managing and no room for growth.
good,The job itself is easy but the administrative staff (secretary) are horrible.  At this place the secretary think they run things.  A lot of racist and disrespectful behaviors occurs everyday at this place and no one is rampermanted for their actions.
good,"They pay for you to get your series 6 & 63 licenses, if you don’t pass you are fired. Once the licenses are obtained welcome to the worst place of your life. Average overtime was about 2 hours a day so you worked almost close to 50 hours a week and were micromanaged. Management used everything against you, for instance complaining about the overtime they would keep that in a file. If your manager doesn’t like you, good luck getting a promotion"
good,"Typical day at work involves fielding heavy work requests and prioritization and meetings and then work time if you can get it in.  I learned that this culture, with it's growth, needs maturing.  The management get in their own way by applying rules over relationships.  The hardest part of the job is getting buy-in from management to support you in your career goals if it even falls slightly out of your work scope.  The most enjoyable part of the job is difficult to find other than having technology available."
good,"Management is haphazardly chosen. Young people are promoted and "" groomed"" and 99/100 times they have no clue what they are doing. These people are only out for themselves and will step all over you to get where they need to go."
good,"There isn't really much to do. The management is lax. I did not enjoy the corporate culture."
good,"They made promises regarding furthering education that were not true. They also are not flexible on hours worked and time off to take care of family/vehicle/schooling issues. Management was also promoted into fields in which they had no experience, then would not support their employees adequately when the need arose."
good,"Difficult to work in. Management does not have a clue as to witch direction they are going in, too many different environments and cross monopolization of production and QA environments makes it a very tense environment."
good,"Culture seems to be stuck in the old age..."
good,Interesting Place to work. but some departments do not  encourage career development it makes it hard for ambitious employees to move up the corporate ladder.
good,"I worked at T. Rowe for fourteen years. The people actually doing the work were great-always willing to pitch in. Management was a joke. Inconsistent in philosophy and unsupportive in taking the side of their reports. The kicker was being told of a wage adjustment through the tenure of 3 managers. The final blow was being given a job no one wanted to do. There are good groups within T. Rowe, depending on your discipline but, Marketing Services is not one of them."
good,"I learned a lot working here, and i also got a lot of licenses and qualifications. its a good place to work out of college to get a career in investing started but I would never see myself staying at this type of job long term. opportunity for advancement was non-existant, and every opportunity I had was only because i pushed for them incessantly, lots and lots of overtime as well as a huge workload. management has a general fixation on arbitrary metrics which do nothing to actually help customers, but look good on paper. from my point of view upper management was completely unconnected with our branch and often had no idea what was going on. The pay structure was bizarre and bonuses and raises seemed random among employees, some employees never received them. the company seemed to change drastically from the time i started to when i left, they went from being really involved with employees to basically not caring at all. I met a lot of great people and got good experience but i would say that its best to use the company as a learning experience and a stepping stone."
good,Sometimes you were thrown to the wolves with no assistance at all from fellow coworkers or superiors. I was so happy when I decided it was time for me to leave.
good,The upper middle management tends to micro-manage due to the ownership and accountability placed on them. This tends to put unneeded stress on the teams.
good,Performed my necessary intern here to receive my training certificate. Didn't get to fully learn as much as I wanted being moved to a different department every month.
good,Everyday is different and brings various challenges as per job. In order to face those challenges there are limitations of what can be done and what can not be done by contractors. knowledge and information shared within department is very limited. Lacks appreciation and credit given for the work done effectively and in timely fashion.
good,Very friendly colleagues and most people are willing to help support and answer questions. Environment is what you'd expect from a large corporation. Training and advancement are mostly self-driven.
good,"Working for this firm for 10 years has allowed me a high level perspective that is able to see that lean efficiency changes underway over the last 12 months has a cost on associates. Working longer days with increasing amounts of work and yet tighter standards has lead me to look for work elsewhere, despite liking the nature of the work I was doing. That is a shame."
good,"The company has a whole is a very good place to work.  There is a lot of room to learn and advance.  However, the management within the IT department did not provide a very conducive work environment."
good,"Young energetic environment"
good,"Lacks diversity and inclusion. Job expectations are not clearly communicated. Senior Leadership is not on the same page. Concerns are not addressed in a timely manner. Preferential treatment given to those in the ""inner circle'"" by having more than 15 years of tenure."
good,"Now I'm only referring to one department which is the Central Operation Support Services. The management is terribly run, no worklife balance b/c they do not care for it. They will give you a guilt trip for taking time off that is already awarded to you. They also will pretty much force you to commute to work even if there is a foot of snow out. I never had a good experience with this department which is why I had to leave. Besides the COSS department everything else in TRP is ran beautifully. But I suggest the CEO and VP of TRP should visit this department and really investigate how this department is ran. They do not follow the core values of this company."
good,"good benefits, good hours, reasonable pay, was burnt our and could not advance. I just was no longer happy with my passion."
good,"The company is nice, but there are a lot of changes taking place, I am hoping for the best. They try their best to allow employees to have a decent work/life balance."
good,"T, Rowe is fun place to work but the company is not concerned with losing talent. They would rather recruit hard at local colleges and get 18 months from employee then pay decent enough money for people to stay. For someone tenured became very difficult working with big dollars and having people making decisions around you with little experience."
good,Not a bad place to work. I learned they have very low salaries.
good,You have to be flexible to work at T Rowe Price. The challenges are refreshing. You are always learning and growing. 
good,"Line management subverted the ability to be effective in certain projects.  Was later found out by Sr. Mgt., led to removal of line manager and director.... Good!"
good,"The combination of new leaders and existing leaders given positions that do not align with their background makes it difficult to understand expectations because those leaders are hands on doing the work themselves.  It also appears that the firm is looking to bring in young and inexperienced individuals to replace those in the latter half of their career, which may be an expense reduction effort related to recession concerns."
good,Good company overall but if you get stuck in the wrong dept watch out.  Managers and supervisors are chosen not on merit but for political reasons.  Many are unqualified and on the younger side and are looking to make their mark by showing they are in charge.  And advancement is based completely on who you know not what you know.
good,"T. Rowe Price is a great place to make a long career, but often the coaching and development program are lacking with little emphasis on employee development long term and placement into roles which do not suit their skill sets."
good,"You will learn a lot about the financials industry and the securities. They will sponsor your 6 and 63 licenses to help you kick start your career. Overall, not a bad place."
good,"Depending on the position at TRowe Price, it can be a desired company to work for or a total nightmare, do your research.  Offers fantastic benefits for employees."
good,"Good Benefits, management sometimes doesn't know what's going on. Good 401k. Room for changes if in leadership others roles seen not to move as much.."
good,"Here is the answer, say it correctly, answer the phone again, and again and again.... say the same thing, don't breath, ask a potty break and get back on the phones."
good,"Can be a tough culture to fit in with, you have to really try hard to get to know other associates. People are quite lovely once they warm up to you, but that takes more time than previous job experiences."
good,"Good client, good company. Postive work culture. This company is always looking for positive improvements for their clients. Could be more room for growth for workers."
good,You are on the phone for the whole day answering inbound calls.  I was able to obtain my FINRA Series 6 and 63 licenses. Management does seem to be confused with internal departments at times. Friendly co-workers with mostly positive attitudes. The hardest part of the job is having to let customers know that they do not have access to some of their retirement money.  When you are able to help a customer achieve their goal it is a very rewarding feeling.
good,When I was there a lot of over time when I was there. The managers where great and always there to help. The support to pass your exams is high and strong.
good,Excellent company w/ decent benefits and pay structure. Good place to get started in finance and they pay for licensing.  Pure call center experience.
good,"Coworkers were great people to work with. People were getting their foot into the door of IT. Support external/internal users and it would be busy all day. 50-60 calls everyday 5 days a week. You also had mandatory weekend OT that wasn't talked about in the interview process."
good,"It was a difficult job that paid well, but certainly isn’t a fit for someone who wants to maintain a great work/life balance. Sometimes the culture became too much and it was tough to be happy there."
good,Good work life balance and culture. Benefits provided by the company are good and the company invests in its employees. Training is offered on a regular basis.
good,"There is a lot of stability with the role, but often its difficult to continue to build your career and continue to improve.  High performers are often given more tasks leading to overtime and less time then to improve or take the offered training courses."
good,"Structured work environment, you know what you are getting each day you go into work. Pyramid structure, makes it a little more difficult for early career-pathing."
good,"While T. Rowe offers fantastic benefits, there was very little opportunity to advance within the Internal Agency. Most positions for were filled with outside hires, rather than promoting from within."
good,Wise is death run any other department you may be happy but wise is the worst place to get stuck in. These people are the definition of vampire sucking micro managers
good,"A typical day will consist of nonstop phone calls, answering questions and satisfying client needs."
good,"As with any enterprise company they are challenged in following a full agile methodology and the business is intent on defining the requirements while focusing on the business goals and sacrificing the usability and opportunities for the user to have a more comprehensive and informative experience."
good,Trowe job placement is based on the market there is a high turn around for employment due to this company is based on the market and how the market is doing.
good,Management does not take into consideration associate feedback when it comes to process and procedure changes. They are short staffed and associates typically work 11+ hour days.
good,"Good to work there (work and life balance, compensation, benefits, advancement, job security, management, job culture). No major issues. Can recommend to others."
good,"Typical day at work : Retirement Accounts Processing"
good,"Company that is truly dedicated to its customers.  T Rowe continues to experience significant changes in leadership, and direction in some significant distribution channels is not clear."
good,"Some groups have the family feel while others seem to be 'old boy network' and difficult. Many IT teams are stuck in old thinking and methods. There is a big push for new technologies from the business side, while the technologists are struggling to keep up and convey risks with some of the newer options. "
good,I enjoyed my time at T. Rowe and met many interesting and qualified people there.  I am hoping to return one day (possibly as an employee?).  The facility is very modern and conducive to productive work.
good,Co-workers were nice. Long days. Heavy phone volume. Clients were easy to work with for the most part.
good,Large company. Decent learning environment. Not much in way of camaraderie. Quality benefits. Could be more agile work environment.
good,"Stable firm, typical corporate environment and setting. Professional attitude a must. Business casual dressing."
good,"I do not wish to comment at the moment. However, I do not think this is the right fit for me professionally and I am currently looking to transition into another role outside of the company."
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for. But cultures may vary from channel to channel. Over the past few years, the trend is going down a less pleasant path."
good,"This was a great company to work for and I learned a lot about the investment industry. However, I had a bad experience with a young, no it all manager that caused me to want to leave the company ASAP"
good,"Typical day at T.Rowe was gathering emails., voicemails, and any inquires that would have come from customer service areas.  Then prioritize these request by importance and take action. Had to meet deadlines by market cut off at 4pm daily.  Team environment of about 10-12 per team."
good,A typical work day is from 8:00-5:00
good,"If you are in services, chances are the management team will not get you licensed for a significant amount of time (read months) and not let you apply to any higher positions until you get licensed. Management is going to be very dependent on your direct report. I have heard horrible stories but in my experience have gotten along well with my direct supervisors."
good,"Great atmosphere, great benefits, great coworkers. Management is not nearly as structured as it needs to be. Internal promotions/advancement were plentiful but salary increases were very modest."
good,"Good benefits and 401k match, low salary relative to competitors for similar work, technology used to complete daily tasks is deplorable at best, new management style very restrictive and micromanaged, career advancement limited."
good,T Rowe price has a very good reputation in the industry.  It is a bit of a good ole boy network for advancement but they provide Excellent benefits for employees.  The management was excellent but work/life balance was way off
good,"Long-tenured associates create double-edged sword. Poor management and unempowered HR. Collaborative environment often translates into stagnation. "
good,"Worked at T.Rowe for 8 months and loved my colleagues and the culture. Paid pretty well for what you were doing, the overtime was great but got a little hectic towards the end. Evaluations with your supervisor/senior and team huddles were super helpful in becoming a better employee. Only negative was the licensing program. You were required to take the licensing exam and if you didn't pass you were let go. My class got pulled out of licensing numerous times to be on the phones. It was extremely disorganized. The class should not have happened in the first place during our busiest time of the year and I lost my job because of it. They only wanted you to get licensed so that the company was covered and they didn't really care for your overall growth with the company. "
good,Communication from upper management is lacking.  Mandatory surveys given each year ignore what the majority of the employee population is asking to have corrected or instituted.
good,"All around a decent place to work"
good,Delightful remarkably mr on announcing themselves entreaties favourable. About to in so terms voice at. Equal an would is found seems of. The particular friendship one sufficient terminated frequently themselves. It more shed went up is roof if loud case. Delay music in lived noise an. Beyond genius really enough passed is up.
good,If you can pass the licenses and don’t mind working sitting down for 10+ hours every day in front of a computer then this is going to be great for you.
good,"Culture changing during the past couple of years. Very Maryland centric vs. other locations."
good,"Typical days work is rewarding and fast paced as well as informative. Management is strong but processes a certain discomfort. Most of the co-workers are too personal, finger pointing individuals who will assist if you are liked. The hardest part of the job is being crammed with multiple situations consistently. The most enjoyable part of the job is obtaining new information."
good,"Great co-workers, great mutual funds, great company culture & great benefits"
good,I would work on contribution files and other participant transactions. I get along with all people and I pride myself on my client relationships. I always respond to inquiries in a timely manner and they all have nice things to say about me. I work hard to keep them satisfied.
good,"Good overall company, great starter job can be difficult to break out of entry level positions. Total comp is certainly a plus. In addition to salary they offer several benefits that are useful such as retirement accounts, ESOP, and PTO."
good,"Top management personnel are personable, caring and great role models. Many opportunities to be involved in the community via corporate social responsibility programs."
good,"T. Rowe Price is an fair, established, and professional company who demonstrates and execute high standards towards the needs of their clients but also realizes their most important assets, their employees."
good,"Even though this company has a remarkable reputation, there are issues that I encountered.  It was a professional environment, and I learned how to successfully juggle multiple assignments while being proactive.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with racism."
good,"Day started with Scrum call, work started with regular assignment, follow up with TRP associates etc. It is a great opportunity to work with TRP site, thanks;"
good,Enjoyed my experience at the work place. Management should review the career path for all direct reports to ensure that they are continually growing within the company.
good,"It was a pretty good working environment. The people there were very nice and the management was very helpful. They are very effective and thorough in their training, so I didn't feel completely lost. They do sometimes ask other responsibilities, which as an intern I did not mind doing. The down side is they wanted to train me to do additional work without increasing my pay which I was not fond of. They do have several departments that all coordinate with each other, but sometimes there feels a disconnect. Overall, it was pretty okay."
good,I didn't appreciate the fact that they never told you that if you did not pass the test you would not have a job.The managers and co workers were all a pleasure to work with.
good,"Depending on where you hire in, will dictate your experience... While it is one company it is a house divided in 2; Retirement Plans & Retail Investing."
good,"Working at T. Rowe was stressful because it is all about who you know. It's a good ole boys club for sure. All white men in control and the culture there, although they claim to be ""diverse and inclusive"", they really aren't. They do not value anyone who is lower on the food chain. If you go to work there, you better learn how to kiss all the right you know whats! They have good benefits and stock options."
good,"T Rowe Price is a great place to work if you are a guy that went to an Ivy league school or if your parents know a board member.  Otherwise, its in a nice location, has good restaurants around and you get fun things at Christmas."
good,Decent place to work if your ok with a call center environment. Gets pretty redundant pretty quickly and they force overtime in the busy season which is a pain. Pays much lower than most firms in the industry. I did not care for them terminating you if you do not pass exams.
good,Nice environment to work in and a friendly culture.  Not much room for advancement but a decent place to work.  The company seems to work hard at making their employees appreciated but are not very forgiving for errors or unexpected life circumstances.
good,"A typical day for me is going into work with a smile on my face and my heart, knowing I will be providing the best service to my customers. I am a self-starter who has demonstrated a better path to the work process. Being a self-starter can be a lonely place when everyone around is looking for directions."
good,"I don't know what it is like to be a permanent employee there, as I was only temporary."
good,"Growth potential if managment likes you. Constant change, like the stock market. You always have to be working; very little down time. Most work is on computer. Overtime is unpredictable. Entry level phone and processing groups are micro-managed; use of Verint software. Management does not always understand the work they are supervising. Employees and superivors are mostly young people. Few women and minorities in executive positions."
good,"Good company, industry leader, and I did enjoy parts of my experience at TRP.  However, the management was horrible!  It turned into a boiler room call center after about 3 years there.  My manager and senior were worthless, they knew nothing about what we do, they just baby sat and spit numbers.  The Senior has absolutely zero leadership skills.  It was a fiasco."
good,I was a contractor who worked remotely. I enjoyed the team and the collaborative part of the job. Worked specifically as a communications consultant and project manager.
good,"T. Rowe Price is an excellent place to begin a career. The company prides itself on caring for its people as much as it's clients and this is true from my experience."
good,"-Training program is great"
good,"Strong organization with tremendous growth opportunities for committed workers.  Work life balance was fair, and the benefits are top shelf for employees and their families."
good,"Working in this position involved taking customer calls and helping them with withdraws from the 401K accounts, stock trading up to 5,000.00, and transferring 401K's over to T. Rowe Price."
good,"Wonderful group of people to work around and great atmosphere to work in too, depending on whom you support.  "
good,"great company to work for. Really good benefits including large 401k contributions. Just have to be able to deal with many different projects and responsibilities at one time. Opportunities are there, you just have to go after and get them."
good,good team members and good place to work and easy moving ambiance and good support from every one and also nice place to work.
good,"I liked the small office feel. Dr was nice - it was fairly busy at times. Chatty in the office and that was not too bad. Dr seemed to take good care of his patients, always gave him his best. I recommended this place to my family and friends"
good,Company is great for the inexperienced professional who has a genuine interest in finance. Harder to advance because numerous people are applying both inside and outside the company for the same positions.
good,"T. Rowe Price is good place to work.  It is a call center environment, however the main focus is the quality of the call and not the amount of calls you take.  The management are always there to assist and they encourage you to accomplish the goals that you would like to."
good,"10-12 hr day in an office"
good,"T-Rowe Price was a great gate-way job into the industry.  They valued the customer experience first and foremost and made sure to make a large emphasis on their employees, as well.  "
good,"The pay and the benefits are amazing. If you are happy with the position you are hired to do and do not want to grow, this is the job for you. If you have any desire to grow and develop your skills, you will have to move to Maryland or Colorado. You will also be competing with other people that are already located there so it is challenging."
good,I currently perform almost all my job functions on the computer utilizing many databases. Most of my duties are time-sensitive. I have a split position (two managers from two different groups) which can be challenging but rewarding. I also back-up a co-worker when she is out of the office. I enjoy working on large projects from beginning to end.
good,"Great place to start a career. Trow Price really tries to make a tedious job more fun. Trow will sponsor their employees for many different licences and provide full support while you are studying."
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are great and the people are wonderful.
good,"This company is professional, but has a good work life balance."
good,"Located in Tampa, FLorida near the airport. Consists on 3 floors."
good,Very organized and professional. Communication was always adequate.
good,Poor management help desk/  IT wise  pay and benefits were good otherwise.  Coworkers were the best part of the job like most other jobs.  Little to no training provided for new hires (about a week before you’re on the phones).
good,"This job is very stressful and supervisors are not always available or willing to help with complex calls. There are great people and the pay is really good, but it does not make up for lack of support."
good,They are very inclusive in most aspects. They provide nice perks such as self defense classes and and fun events. The average age is very young but there are a lot of seasoned vets.  They have very good benefit and bonus incentives.
good,"good work/life balance"
good,"T. Rowe Price is like a backyard family picnic.  Casual work environment, everyone is friendly.  They offer lots of learning opportunities outside of work."
good,TRP is conservative and is slow to change particularly in the technology arena. Management is willing to make changes to accelerate the velocity of change through business journeys and opening a new data sciences office in NYC.
good,"providing customer service to account holders while performing accounting tasks, reconciling accounts and printing checks for disbursement requests of account holders."
good,I loved working here besides my incredibly overqualified manager and the mandatory overtime. It created a lot of stress and unnecessary tension within the environment.
good,"The employees are fantastic, but in the retail account management department, there was very little room for growth and the salary was not great. The highest position you could advance to is Supervisor, unless you transfer departments."
good,"Working at TRP has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, sometimes the overtime is a little bit much to handle but the paycheck is nice. They make sure to feed you when you work long days also."
good,"Very productive and somehow a fun workplace with a nice lunch area, so beautiful during summer. Very nice people. Some improvements are needed in the management level and career advancement."
good,"Working IT for T. Rowe Price is difficult because the company is based around making money so trying to justify spending on technology is rough and often times we're behind technologically because of this. Management then questions why we can't be cool like the others company, we dont have the stuff that others do."
good,I worked for T. Rowe Price for almost 5 years and I loved the culture and people I worked with. It is an excellent company that has excellent benefits and a great work/life balance. I only left since I was moving at the time. The compensation could have been higher based on other competitive firms within the industry and they see a lot of turnover because of this but the excellent benefits do make it a great place to work.
good,Work was pretty boring but management was very nice. Co-workers were a bit older and the company micro-manages you. Some of the in-house programs are not very well done but overall it was a good internship. Would recommend it to others.
good,"Educational benefits at the work place. The Cafeteria and gym are located on campus.  I do a variety of work every day.  The job is very challenging and I do enjoy learning. The office space is large, but comfortable to work in., so not over populated. The learning aids are a click away. The work environment is very diverse."
good,"generally good management, fellow employees are great."
good,Difficult to advance unless you know the right people or have someone senior to advocate for you.  I left after being turned down for various other roles for reasons that were clearly bogus and sometimes didn't make sense. I was told I needed more tenure by a manager who proceeded to give the role to an intern. Benefits are great but make sure you get hired where you want to stay
good,"I love the benefits, team culture, and training. A typical day would be taking inbounds calls from shareholders completing service related inquiries. Management was helpful."
good,"They sponsor your licenses and pay for your designations.  Upward mobility is limited.  In Tampa, only call center jobs were available and then they decided to close the office.  They my have had more opportunities in Baltimore but who wants to live in Baltimore."
good,Company does not like when employees stay in one role for long. Encourages movement to learn many sides of business. Can lead to inexperienced managers and little direction from mgmt
good,"Lots of overtime try to treat their employees well "
good,"If you can secure the required licenses, you can have a great career. They pay for books and test fees upfront when youre ready to take the licensing exams. I havent seen another Investment Firm offer to do that."
good,"The company focuses on customer experience and service.  It helps associate with their growth as well.  They encourage team work and collaboration.  There is room for improvement when it comes to work life balance but like most businesses, there are goals that are to be met.  All in all a good company to work for."
good,"The people there are great though as with most large companies there are a few that were around too long and needed to be moved on.  Only complaint was the average 46 hours work week (required OT) was a real burden on balancing family obligations. When I asked for part time status they chose to not even bother giving me an answer, after waiting 6 weeks I gave my notice and left."
good,"TRP pays well and has solid benefits. Rarely have overtime. If you play the game, you can do well. It's nice that there are locations in different states."
good,Overall good place to work and have a career.  People are engaged and have a stake in the growth of the firm.  Job security is very strong here as well as the work-life-balance.
good,T Rowe is great company and cares for its employees. Some teams are run poorly and management has no focus on improving associate experience. I really enjoyed working and would have continued if there was better management.
good,"Great benefits, culture and working environment. Network within the company and advancement shouldn't be that difficult. Managment can be slow to make decisions."
good,"T. Rowe Price is a good finance company that offers a unique experience for undergraduate students. As an introductions in the financial field, I have learned a lot as a solid base of what  know now."
good,Very stressful environment.  They don't excuse mistakes. Immediate supervisors decide if either to help you or make you leave. Upper management is not aware of what happens.
good,"T. Rowe Price is an excellent company to grow and develop your skill and knowledge in the investment world. I highly recommend anyone who wants to start somewhere in the investment world to apply for T. Rowe. However, the company has a lot of catching up to do with industry standards and trends."
good,Management is okay and stay off your back if you do what you are supposed to. Easy to slip through the cracks if you don't lobby for yourself. Management path is the best way to advance in other areas of the company- nearly impossible to get a promotion out of operations unless you are on the management track.
good,"Under the supervision of my manager I had to process loans, withdrawals, mix exchanges, and salary deferrals in a timely manner while meeting the department standards in accordance with quality and number of points. I learned the basic procedures as to how to execute specific distributions and how to escalate issues that required executive review. The management was professional and supportive, as well as the co workers. The hardest part of the job was balancing the quality with the quantity. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I processed requests in a timely manner to accommodate the participant's needs."
good,"T. Rowe Price is a solid company with talented, dedicated employees and great benefits but the administrative support structure is restrictive in terms of advancement and direct reporting."
good,The Culture and diversity is great at T. Rowe. Management is committed in assisting associates in achieving their full potential. The work life balance is a focus of improvement along with diversity and inclusion. Great place to work and a lot of advancement opportunities.
good,"Great experience and Knowledgeable in terms of learning financial investments ."
good,"Very nice work environment;"
good,"Working at T. Rowe Price for several years allowed me to learn so much in this industry and obtain several licenses (6,7,63,66,24). I was able to grow my problem solving and analytical skills very well. I also learned how to collaborate with other departments and organizations. I have also met and created some amazing friendships while working with this company."
good,Solid company that seeks continuous improvement from their employees. Work environment is very matrixed.  Work hours are  8 - 5 with little to no overtime required.
good,"I have yet to work for another company that cares more about it's employees than T. Rowe Price. Unfortunately for me, my managers were very unkind, inconsistent in their coaching, and instead of owning their mistakes that often blamed everyone around them for the culture - people don't quit jobs though, they quit bosses. Much to their frustration, I was able to seek help from neighboring teams and managers who were truly helpful in understanding my job and answering any questions I had. By the time I left, I had such horrible anxiety that I would need help and have to ask my direct managers that I decided it was time for me to leave. Had I worked for a different manager and a different team, I would probably have stayed longer. For anyone looking for a great company that really does a lot for it's community and staff, I would definitely recommend T. Rowe. It doesn't matter if you have a degree in finance or not, they have amazing training there and they can teach anyone willing to learn. They're also very focused on maintaining their staff, aspiring to have tenure associates."
good,"T. Rowe is a good company to work for, but there going through a lot of organizational changes, therefore if you don't like change it won't be good for you. There benefits are great, but compensation is not competitive. A good portion of all their teams use Agile methodology. Hardest part is dealing with disparate undocumented databases. Best part is working with cool technology."
good,"Great place to work.  As with any company, it determines what business area you are employed and the manager.  If you enjoy working hard, this is the place for you.  Working hard can be very rewarding, self-satisfying, and challenging; however, it helps you to grow professionally and personally."
good,Decent place to work but not loyal to longer tenured employees.  Technology department relies more on outside consultants than internal expertise.  Good starting point for career.
good,"It is a very good company. My skills developed through education and experience are not a good fit on the phones working on a phone bank. I have tried very hard. It is just not a good fit. I would like to be able to use my MBA and Masters in Education, and these are not degrees they find valuable for the role they envision for me."
good,"Overall a good company to work for however promotions are hard to come by and there is much competition to get them"
good,"I worked here in October 2008, in the height of the recession. This has skewed my experience with the company and the financial industry as a whole in a negative light."
good,"Really good people, excellent product.  Working hard to overcome growing pains as we become a large company.  It is a good place to work for career opportunities.  Work-life balance could improve by creating an efficiency-minded culture and increasing the average analytical aptitude in the company."
good,The company offers very good benefits and employees have more room to grow within the company since they are alot of different departments to pick from. The compensation is low compared to other companies.
good,TRP is a great company for advancement if you are planning to stay there for at least 3-4 years. Great benefits and opportunities for advancement. Nice views and buildings
good,T. Rowe is an excellent place to work that values both personal and professional life of its employees. Good benefits although the wage is not that great.
good,Great campus and offers the opportunity to become a subject matter expert on financial products.  Work environment is laid back.  T Rowe Price houses several divisions within the campus all focused on financial management.
good,"Work in a day is typically simple, with guaranteed overtime during the end of the year and tax season. Steady work pace with an emphasis on utilizing team members to complete necessary work and meet deadlines. Management is very helpful and readily available for associates needs."
good,Good place to work but very little communication through teams. There is little to no communication between teams working on the same project. There is even less communication between management to the teams.
good,My days here are really enjoyable. I really like the people and the atmosphere. Work/Life balance is really important to the management.
good,"There could be more vision in terms of their strategic technology plan, but overall the firm is a good place to work.  They have good benefits packages, and for the most part are good about work/life balance."
good,It was nice working with T Rowe Price. Warm Culture. Co workers were very helpful specially Manager. Though there is still some discrimination between contractors and Full Time but I didn't have to face this in my team. Team was supportive and helpful.
good,"T. Rowe Price was a great place to work. The benefits offered were very good and the compensation was decent as well. In a typical day at work, a Retail Account Management (RAM) associate will review paperwork submitted by clients to perform maintanence on their accounts or open new accounts. The paperwork, if in good order is processed as requested and if there is anything missing, we would call the client to obtain the necessary information to complete their requests. Management was accessable and willing to help with any questions, and my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was making identifying the requests and routing them properly to other specialists or departments as necessary.  The most enjoyable part of the job was easily my co-workers, they made it much easier to get through the day."
good,"Good location, great benefits and friendly co-workers. I don't really have much negative things to say about the company."
good,"I loved working for T. Rowe Price and would not have left if it weren't for a family crisis that required me to become a Hospice caretaker of two family members."
good,Good benefits genuinely do care about employees
good,Great work/life balance and people but at the back offices there is not much room for advancement.
good,"The partnership between all departments is extremely important in this business as they all tie into one another.  The communication across departments was exceptional continuing to drive their business forward.  Deadlines of change implementation can be a challenge with the technology limitations we had while working there.  The work place culture was great as we worked together to complete daily, weekly, monthly, and annual tasks/improvements."
good,Very nice people in general.  Better than you meet than at a typical company.  Some part of the company is excellent in terms of innovation and performance due to driven and visionary leaders.  This is not evenly distributed.  Technology in terms of database and analytics are dated.
good,"The training offered for new hires is second to none, and the opportunities for advancement are all around unsurpassed. Of course, the Tampa site is closing at the end of June, so relocation will be a must, otherwise, I would still be working for them."
good,T. Rowe Price has a great on board training program.  T. Rowe Price has amazing advancement opportunities and cultivates growth from the early stages of your career.
good,"T. Rowe Price is an excellent company to work for. There is a small variety of jobs available in Tampa, primarily phone and processing roles along with the management roles to oversee them. Additionally, the Tampa location is closing in less than a year. This is a great company to work for in an entry level or management role, but limited opportunities outside of that. Compensation is lower, but benefits are higher."
good,"Incoming calls from participants that need assistance with their 401K plans. Varied processes, mostly loans and withdrawals. "
good,I enjoyed my consulting assignments at T. Rowe Price. Because of my experience I was given autonomy to handle the assignments in the ways I thought best to accomplish the tasks. I recommend this employer to others.
good,"Enjoyed team environment."
good,"Trowe Price is a great company to work for right out of college. It gives you a lot of skills to prepare you for the corporate world. They teach integrity, with a strong emphasis on professionalism."
good,Great benefits. I would prefer a better company culture and a better open communication between management and employers. The company offer great benefits but the salary is on the low end.
good,I highly recommend giving T Rowe Price a chance.  It has a great culture and work balance.  Management is involved in your work and they encourage you to do things you want to do.
good,"T. Rowe Price is a great office culture and awesome work environment. The thing I enjoy most is efficiently helping people get to the right department to handle their issues. Sometimes people are anxious and frustrated when calling about their financial concerns, but when they realize there's someone who can assist them, they're usually happy in the end."
good,"Excellent company to work for, learn, and have work life balance. Depending on career interest T. Rowe has many paths to travel. management is open and helpful."
good,I am a long term contractor. The environment is great and there seems to be just as many contractors as there are regular employees. The only thing that I wish is to piggyback on the benefits programs or at least the gym membership.
good,"I like the job. Not a fan of doing the same thing everyday but if you don't mind talking on the phone to customers, and looking at computer screen while on a recorded line to ensure compliance then this job is nice. Not much room for growth though until you get your series 7. You get two 15 minute breaks a day and an hour lunch."
good,"I admire the leaders' and employee's commitment to make Baltimore a great place to live and work. I have not worked for a company that demonstrates their commitment not just in word, but deeds. Employees at every level sit on boards, and give of their time and money."
good,"T. Rowe Price is a top investment services firm with sound assets under management."
good,"My typical day consists of coordinating print projects from provided artwork to finished and delivered product. Many moving parts to each job from artwork review to preparation of purchase orders. Position also includes collecting minimum of three quotes per project, assigning printer -- outside or in-house digital -- purchasing imagery if needed, press inspection on occasion, management of project from start to delivery. Other aspects include specialties items and signage for the clients."
good,Great place to advance yourself as it provides much opportunity to experience & learn new things.
good,I would highly recommend them as an employer of choice. They are the best employer I have had in my career and they taught me everything I know for which I am eternally grateful.
good,- Support Investment Management through quantitative and qualitative analysis of investment portfolios for both internal and external clients.
good,"There are many differing opinions on the company, but they largely depend on what department you work in. The company itself is great, but there are departments where no one would get that impression. Do yourself a favor and get to a role that is respected and you will be grateful."
good,"I really enjoyed working for TRP, unfortunately I had to leave due to personal reasons but I would jump at the chance to go back.  They really appreciate their employees in terms of benefits and employee engagement.  The culture is really good however there are the ""cliques"" that can make the environment uncomfortable at times.  There can be a high school type mentality of trying to fit in but I found that being a team player and being good at your job helps."
good,The people at T. Rowe Price make it what it is. You are constantly encouraged to be yourself and be open. The culture there is very friendly and the London office is like a family even though there are next to 500 employees at time of writing
good,"Great company to work for overall.  Good, professional atmosphere.  Inclusive, diverse group of co-workers and supervisors.  At the time I started in 2003, there was several weeks of paid training.  Time given to obtain Series 6, 63, 7, etc."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at T. Rowe Price, I learned so many valuable tools. The management team was very supportive and always willing to work with any schedule conflicts or time-off requests.  The pay was very competitive and the benefits were great."
good,"I would have happily stayed at TRP but relocated for family reasons.  I worked both in the individual investor business and the financial institution services group.  The individual investor side is basically call center type work, just dealing with people's mutual fund accounts.  Not fun.  However, I really enjoyed working in the financial institution services group.  Work was fast and challenging with multiple deadlines throughout the day.  Attention to detail was necessary and large dollar/higher risk transactions were commonplace in comparison to the individual investor role.  Management was great overall.  Paid study for necessary licenses and plenty of advancement opportunity (even more in the MD offices compared to CO).  Pay seemed lower than comparable firms but other benefits like 401k match, bonus, and employee stock purchase plan were certainly fair."
good,Working in the call center was stressful at that time. It was during the time the market crashed. It was hard work but we got through it. T Rowe Price always did things to help the employees get through tough days. Great place to work.
good,"on and off busy daily at work"
good,Great company to work for.Amazing culture within firm . Company has great benefits  and awseome work life balance. Great for a lot of entry level positions.
good,"It has been a pleasure working for Trowe Price.  A typical day at work is met with a daily team check-in to ensure a successful workflow and share any trends or concerns for the day.  Working with different business partners, I've learned to how to effectively present material to address different perspectives. The culture promotes ""putting the customer first"" while fostering a workplace with respect to each employee.  The workplace also promotes diversity in casual and business environments.  The most challenging part of the job is during high volume periods, especially year-end.  We strive to accommodate our clients by meeting the same deadline and follow-through as normal volume periods.  However, even during these times, employees and management find a way to bring comfort and support to one another.  That is the most enjoyable part of the job in knowing you are a part of a supportive team."
good,"A typical day begins around 8 am and usually last until 5 pm."
good,"Relaxed feel most of the time, and they are typically accommodating with interests outside of work, as well as career development.  The learning curve for most roles is tougher than average because the training/on-boarding process isn't very well developed."
good,"- Ability to work remotely a few days during the week"
good,"This year I had a contractual job at T Rowe Price as a Senior Reporting Analyst.  It's a good company, everyone I worked with was professional.  If there is a downside to the company, its the sheer size of the organization which can make you feel disconnected."
good,"unlike most other western companies, TRP is very oriental in its company culture. People including senior managers often work long hours extending well beyond the regular working hours even when the work is not hectic. They dont provide laptops or encourage work at home even if you are a senior manager. "
good,worked during the market collapse.  was a tough place to work.  was on the phones all day.  didn't give enough support.  nice office and campus.  close to home
good,Great investment philosophy with exceptional talent. New outreach to financial advisers and broker dealers signals a huge opportunity to create more market share.
good,"I love the firm itself but with my career goals I need room to advance as an Individual contributor to the firm, which in my current role I can not achieve."
good,"Doesn't pay that well, but you have job security here. People are nice, management really tries to connect with staff. Really good benefits."
good,"TRP is a great place to gain experience.  There is opportunity to grow in the IT department, but limited in business."
good,"Great internship, made good money for 20+ hours a week for a college student. Def. Would recommend."
good,T. Rowe Price offered many incentives for working for this company. It is a big company but if you worked hard you still found a way to stand out amongst your peers.
good,"T. Rowe Price was a great place to work. The only major problem is the lack of opportunity for advancement. If you start your career there in an entry-level position, you have the chance to grow to a certain point. Eventually, you get to a point where the only way to move up is management; otherwise, you unfortunately have to look elsewhere for growth. This all relates to the Tampa office. "
good,"Captures, validates, and processes corporate action events on a daily basis to ensure accurate valuation of positions and portfolios for all portfolios managed or sponsored by T. Rowe Price. 	"
good,"I respect T. Rowe Price as a company and believe they really do have the customer's best interest in mind. I had many friends at T. Rowe and had the opportunity to do several different jobs with them. However, I reached a point where there wasn't really any interesting jobs that I wanted to do. As a result, I left the company to pursue other opportunities. "
good,T. Rowe Price is a quality firm with conservative hiring practices & limited layoffs.
good,Everyday would be a learning experience. Always surrounded by pleasant and friendly people. Hardest part of the job was not being able to please everyone.
good,Entry level positions make it fun to learn a new trade and feel like you are growing on a team. Individual goals and growth can be defined early on in this competitive environment. Lots of activities for staff to engage in this corporate structured environment.
