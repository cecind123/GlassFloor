rating,review
bad,Great company but there was to much micromanaging and you could not do an effective performance.  You are judged by accuracy in reports that are submitted to upper management.
bad,"Where to even begin? This company has gone downhill so fast. Every single new director position is being filled with outside Google employees. They've recently just laid off a good and hard working team of 15 people to afford these new Google people and started parading them around the office like the Macy's Thanksgiving parade. Talk about tone deaf and callous. This company rewards hard work and dedication with bonus cuts and lay offs! When you're no longer needed in your role, instead of being shifted to a new role, they just get rid of you. They don't treat employees like people, just numbers and figures in terms of how you're costing the company. They don't even spare a budget for paper cups and snacks! LOL what a joke! If you want to be treated as subhuman and a liability, by all means, apply. Your manager will be some wet behind the ears newbie who will need his hand held through every tough business decision. Live an hour away and need to work from home during a thunderstorm? TOUGH LUCK. We need everyone in the office to promote a nonexistent culture! Need help from HR to address sexual harassment? DON'T BOTHER. They'll sweep it all under the rug and pretend it didn't happen. Crown Castle is lucky it's not a publicly known company or it would have been rightfully torn to pieces in the media. What a terrible, unethical company."
bad,"Work life balance is terrible, managers encourage you to be working constantly at all hours.  Culture has degraded drastically over the last couple years, our reputation is bad."
bad,"I worked on the T-Mobile project in Sunrise Florida.  the project was corrupt,  the team was not following any protocol. Building sites without approval from customer or landlord."
bad,"They acquire cell towers from telecommunication companies that no longer want to manage those assets.  You have to manage those towers once they are loaded into your system and sell space to other telecommunications companies.  Crown Castle does not train you and they expect you to fully understand all issues that come up with those towers.  The little bit of training I received was visiting other AE's in the USA and seeing how they do there job."
bad,"If the tenure employees don't like you. You will be fired"
bad,"Crown Castle is decorated with disconnected leadership, poor management, favoritism, dysfunctional work groups, poor communication, and a bottom-line focus (not focused on the employee or the customer).  Crown pretends to foster, one company, one voice, but it is really 3 companies â€“ towers, small cell and fiber.  None of these divisions play nice in the sandbox.  In addition, the senior executives have no idea what really happens at the field level or in front of the customer.  In my opinion, they are probably too busy trying to figure out ways to spend their annual bonuses or sell their company stock."
bad,I left a great job due to being recruited by Crown fiber and after 4 and  days they let me go for no reason or explanation.They want you at office at 0800 even if you have construction GC's waiting for you on the other side of town. They also want you to be at office at five before you drive back home even if your home is ten minutes from job site. There were several occasions I was on a job site and I had to drive in traffic one hour to the office just to turn around and drive back in traffic to get home. They use key cards on doors to track your time. That is why they do this. This makes it impossible to be a CM especially if you are only allowed to work 40 hours. I expected more from Crown. It has been a company I have dreamed of working for my entire career and i am just disappointment.. Too bad. Moving on to better things! Their loss.
bad,They like to pretend they care about you but that is a lie.  Very hard to move up unless you are someone's buddy.  They just hire more contractors instead of giving their current employees as real chance to move up.
bad,"Stay away from the Shared services department located at the Canonsburg HQ's. Worst management experience ever. Such a great company, but unfortunately, it takes a few bad apples to ruin it for everyone!"
bad,Quiet & friendly work-environment but no advancement opportunities were ever given. They said that I was doing a great job and then they let me go because I was absent for one week after becoming ill with pneumonia. After working 50 hr weeks for eight months as a contract worker they just let me go for being sick/ absent for one week eight months into my one year contract.
bad,CC has very great potential outside of the senior management team.  There is a lot of nepotism that happens in the Richmond office.  When ever local offices can implant true leaders company at every employee level will be very successful-
bad,most of the management was from lightower they have no care about employees they try their hardest not to give any overtime do the manger can get better bonuses they make the shifts 9hrs even is you dont eat lunch
bad,"Worked hard for over a year and kept on getting passed up on permanent positions to other temps who work less efficiently than me.  They keep on piling up more and more work for you and expect you to finish it all.  Management is very poor.  Hard work is not rewarded.  The only way to move up is to be a ditz. Even if you save the company hundreds of thousands and work way more efficient than your co-workers who like to chit chat, you will get passed up many times for permanent positions because you do enough small talk."
bad,"Company is focused not on our customers as they claim, nor on their employees. B3 culture is gone, except when they want to talk about it. So many hollow words from the EMT. The only thing they care about is the Street View. Now due to company changes they are reaching into our pockets and reducing our AI. Run!"
bad,"You start with a productive plan from day to day and it gets diverted by unplanned so-called ""All Hands"" meetings, or meetings called to help habitual under-performing staff get up to speed.  You often leave these meetings wondering ""What was the purpose? What did it resolve?""  I learned how local and corporate management did not know how to manage change nor control the rate of change, especially as a result of acquiring other companies.  The workplace culture revolved around 3B Values - Be Accountable, Be an Owner, and Be Real.  There were countless examples from non-management employees up to local management staff that showed the 3B values to be clearly ignored.  At best, I can describe it as 80 percent of the employees showing up to do just enough to get by (or less) for bringing a paycheck home.  The remaining 20 percent robbed themselves of the balance needed to enjoy the fullness of personal life for the sake of the company meeting its objectives.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting positive individual feedback from many of the small sub tier suppliers after struggling to ensure that they were financially compensated for their goods and services.  I hope the company changes for the better for future employees who have hopes of making it a place of a career."
bad,Good place to work if you want to be underpaid. Office politics will dictate your job performance. Employee turn over rate is high. Must enjoy drama..
bad,"CCI isn't for everyone, if you need a job and don't mind stretching the truth it's not that bad. There are good managers and there are good people, I just didn't work with any of them during my time there. This is just my personal opinion, you may experience something completely different."
bad,"Amazing opportunities and had a ball working for crown castle.."
bad,"If you are a tech, dont ever expect to advance.  Dead end job.  They love to talk about advancing your career but that is just talk.  They also abuse their contractors and lie to them."
bad,"I felt like this is where my career went to die.  You have to be in the 'click' to get advanced, otherwise you are a pawn for the management to play with for their amusement and political power.  Your experience here will depend greatly by what your position is in this company and who you report to, but I wont risk it taking a job here in hope you win that lottery."
bad,"Why? Because the business model is so good, the Company can't lose money....but they can make it allot slower than their competition, which doesn't impact compensation. "
bad,"The culture when I started was amazing, they treated their employees well however with significant growth and unclear direction of how the company/ employees should build the business the culture quickly declined and the changes in the management positions on doing business are making for a counter-culture that is very negative with no direction or support from management for the day-to-day activities of the employees."
bad,"Management is a mess!!  Glad to be gone, don't be fooled, you are hired as a temp and you will never become full tile"
bad,"The culture has changed significantly over the last year. Employees are promoted based on VP favoritism and not most qualified or best fit. Perks have been taken away. Males earn more than females for same work. Worst of all, there is insufficient headcount while the company continues to be profitable. Entry and mid level employees are overloaded and morale is low."
bad,"The company B3s are a guideline that are not followed by most. Peoples perception of others is very ""blind"" and is the driving force behind their success. Because of this, growth is inhibited. Unconcious Bias is allowed to exist."
bad,"They were not family orientated like they push and say they are. Its all about them,  really enjoyed working with my fellow employees to this day i would do anything for those guys. MGT is not well balanced and does not believe in their employees. They will throw you under the bus quick"
good,"Will review upon request......................................., management needs training courses on how to deal with projects, personnel, and tasks."
good,The department I worked in wasn't the greatest in regards to team collaboration nor were they very good with communication within the team. Management weren't as forth-right on what their expectations were and at times it felt like I was supposed to be a mind-reader.
good,"Not much room for growth. Seem to promote it well but prefer to hire vendors over their loyal employees. Perks of gym and cellphone reimbursement, Lots of training that does not pertain to role."
good,There is no work/life balance. The workload is too heavy to get done within 40 hours. The motivation is overtime is paid which does offset the fact that all you're doing is working 5-7 days per week. There is no mandatory overtime but if you don't meet deadlines your performance suffers. There is no temp to perm path. The company uses a large amount of contractors to avoid paying benefits. Contractors are usually left out of token gifts or giveaways. Contractors are allowed to attend onsite parties. I believe that it would be difficult to not invite contractors as they're at east 50% of the office.
good,"Strong company financials in a competitive market or real estate for telecom. Slow to react to industry trends due to size and status as REIT. Flexible working hours and autonomy on a daily basis, until such time as an ultimate decision must be made; autonomy can be a farce."
good,"Low level management and employees were not connected, and most of the time management had no idea what it takes to perform our day to day duties."
good,"Ever changing, fast paced, heavy workload, always needed additional staffing resources. I enjoyed the Team I worked with, highly professional group of people dedicated to excellence. Written company culture and day to day company culture not in sync."
good,"Not much room for advancement. Also, contractors are treated very poorly. Different departments have different management styles, so you're experience as an employee will vary based on that."
good,"Started as Senior Technician with Crown Communications and grew to many other positions.  Prior to merger, place was like family.  After merger and IPO, turned into typical large over managed, inefficient major corporation."
good,"The company is perpetually unable to hire permanent employees in spite of a need to. They keep hiring temps, but they're in need of permanent employees."
good,The amount of hours I worked was not inline with the compensation I was receiving.
good,"In my department PEP the lower level managers hired mostly their friends and neighbors."
good,The culture promoted by senior leadership wasn't felt in my department.  My direct manager was difficult to work for and induced a lot of stress on her direct reports.  Unfortunately this has colored my view of the company.  As the company has grown it's become a more stressful environment.
good,Company is very profitable but that is not trickling down to the employees. Work load becomes greater while compensation stays the same. Hard to advance unless you're a brown noser or willing to relocate. The benefits are good and the culture is okay but has gotten worse since in the time I've been there.
good,It was fun and I learned a lot. Things did get a bit weird and the company became very corporate. The changes made were in my opinion for the worst.Hopefully things get better.
good,Great place and great people.  Learned a lot from this job.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and the flexibility there.  Wished they would hire more permanent folks instead of contractors.
good,They hire temps and lie to you about your timeframe. I was told I would be brought on full-time within 6 months. I worked for there for a year until I relized they were dragging me on so I found a new position. The management also is a problem. They micro-manage like no tomorrow. Pay is below average for positions
good,Alright place to work but the office is silent and its a very fast paced job. People are coming and going and shifting who they work with a lot during the year.
good,if you know how to play the game.  Not much room for advancement unless you're part of the departmental power circles. The overall company culture is a breath of fresh air but please be aware of specific management practices that don't fairly provide advancement opportunities.
good,There is not enough resources to do my job accurately.  I normally do all the testing which is hard at times because of the limited resources.  Way to much drama which spreads quickly throughout the company.  They have a lot to learn and not many are open to change.
good,"The benefits are decent, better than most places, however there is limited room for advancement and often positions are granted based on nepotism rather than merit."
good,Laid back work environment.  Co-workers overall are friendly.  Flexible schedule.  Everyone starts as a contractor.  Learned a lot about telecom.
good,Crown Castle is a strong company to work for. The biggest positive is that they are a growing company in their industry and continue to look for advancement.
good,"Great people , lack of accounts do to long tenured people. Smaller footprint than that I was used too. otherwise, great company. Recent management shakeup."
good,"Great opportunity to learn.  If you donâ€™t mind working holidays, overnights, evenings, holidays, and 45-60 hours a week itâ€™s a great job.  The people on site are wonderful, including management, and are very helpful when they can be.  The biggest downside is thereâ€™s really nowhere to go within the company once you are here, so you want to climb the ladder you will have to look outside and the  come back once you have more experience."
good,Crown Castle has a very exciting business type and is in an engaging industry. This internship allowed for exposure to a range of actors within the company.
good,The disparity of the work load is very demeaning.  Some are expected to work 50 hours and others only work 20 hours.  Advancement is based on who your friends are and not how hard you work.
good,"I worked in the field as the Crown Castle representative on job sites. I learned that most Vendors hired have personal relationships with Crown upper management. This made it difficult to manage field relationships to high quality standards. As a US Marine I practice great attention to detail, which sometimes strains relationships- (in a good and productive way.) Crown Castle could be great if they properly utilized all management to provide great value to the shareholders."
good,"The last decade has completely transformed the way we interact with the worldâ€”from the smartphone in your hand to the watch on your wrist. And with emerging developments like 5G and smart city technologies, the next decade promises even more change. These exciting innovations all have one thing in commonâ€”our unique portfolio of towers, small cells, and fiber that keeps everything connected. As we prepare for the next generation of transformative technologies, you have the opportunity to help us lead the way."
good,Management hires people who have no idea how to people manage and they act like you should know everything and offer no training on the position that you are in.
good,Crown castle has a fast paced environment.  The culture is starting to be hindered by the fast growth but management is expressing more interest in improving the culture.
good,Good work/life balance.  Opportuities to advance your career.  Company is acquisition hungry; acquired 4+ companies in the past four years. Culture can be challenging at times.
good,"I loved my position with Crown Castle. However, the management was weak and unorganized, along with extreme sexism & favoritism. Excuse these downfalls and it is an amazing place to learn and work, with great coworkers and the insurance is absolutely BEYOND incredible."
good,"Crown is a great place to work at unless your a contractor then your work environment will not be in your favor. Some of the employees treat a contractor like they are less than human and do what they can to make you want to leave by all means possible, Overall everyone else is very nice and willing to give you what support you need on the project your'e working on. Contractors at Crown are the buffer for when the company needs lay people off at the end of the quarter. Overall a great place to work. Free lunches, snacks and coffee."
good,"yes it is a company.  lots of people know this, but some people dont know. It is in fact a company. They also serve lunch sometimes. I like lunch. Lunch is fun"
good,Overall a good place to work.  Extremely busy with conference calls and daily updates to SLT.  Several tracking forms of communication via spreadsheets and on line portals.
good,I learned the basics of Telecommunication companies. Along with the company has a very social and friendly atmosphere.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Crown Castle for the most part, but it's not for everyone. I prefer a more relaxed work culture, more like what you'd find at a startup. I ultimately left to join a legal tech startup, but CC is a great place for someone looking to work up the corporate ladder based on tenure and merit. Cubicles and white noise machines aren't my thing, but the managers I worked with were fantastic and I would jump at the opportunity to work with them again in a new environment."
good,"Working at Crown Castle includes an amazing culture and great people. They are working on the diversity of the company, especially in the management category. However, there is a bias that is inherent in the culture of Crown Castle. Certain types of people are the only ones considered for management positions or they are given positions even without experience or the skills. Basically, everyone is not treated equally at this company. Overall however, this is a good company and they are working on their down points. They do listen to the employee."
good,"Crown is probably one of the best companies I have worked for, but being in sales is very limited on advancement.  Every day is different, dealing with the customer is the best part of my job.  Managment has changed, Don't really have a hard part of my job, most days are good."
good,Culture is great - B3 Values are upheld for the most part but there is a good amount of favoritism towards men. Flexibility is horrible - need more work from home options.
good,A typical day at Crown was very busy and I enjoy staying busy.  I learned that some companies say one thing but do totally the opposite.  The management team is not concerned with the other employees.  I however did enjoy my co-workers.
good,"Supervise different site of work"
good,Not a lot of opportunities for advancement and internal IT systems are not well developed.
good,Good learning environment/ learned on a need-to-know basis; not much chance for advancement or to go  from contract to permanent employee. Work environment and tasks were fun to complete with a friendly environment.
good,"Services Department is a fairly new unit. Things are constantly changing. For the main part, activities driven by projects. I work in a 3 person team where each person being accountable to at least one project. My typical day starts with cataloging and answering emails. Then creating a list of activities that approaching deadlines. Then, I run through and complete my daily routine activities (e.a. follow up on permits in process)."
good,"Day starts at 8am goes through to 6pm usually. Sometimes it gets longer. go out to job location to do inspections, punch walks, "
good,"Company has a great work/life balance and really cares about employees.  Management is great.  The hardest part is that they rely on contractors for 40% of workforce and you need to have ""connections"" to obtain a permanent job regardless of how well you do.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working closely with your own group and good team activities contractors could partake in."
good,"I worked mostly from home and was expected to provide excellent customer service 100% of the time which is what I did. I knew that every morning I had to get up to ensure that I represented the company in a professional way so that all OSHA and construction policies were met according to the company guidelines. I have the initiative to take it upon myself to ensure that customers are installed correctly and that the general contractors doing the work abide by the company directives. I completed pre-construction walks with the contractors, verified construction drawings and approved them if correct or sent them back when there were issues. During construction I looked over the crews to make sure they were within the guidelines of the construction drawings or structural analysis while emphasizing the importance of the customer RFDS. Management had allowed us to do our work as necessary and could see in the systems how we were progressing. The hardest part of the job was when multiple customer expected installs within a small time period which caused long days because we wanted to make sure the customers expectations were met. The most enjoyable part was knowing that we were part of a team and that we met the customer expectations."
good,"Great company to work for! The only downfall is that they don't work well with relocations and working from home, which is the nature of the future of tech companies."
good,Prefer to decline additional comments.  Great place to work under certain management/divisions. I was in a heavy travel position and we were extremely under staffed.
good,I haven't worked at this company for 14 years so my work experience will not be very useful for anyone that is currently looking to get an honest perspective of this establishment.
good,Bad direct management in Irvine Ops unfair treatment mangers hand pick new employees regardless of experience if you know them and they like you your in. Out with the old and in with the new
good,I learn new things everyday about the telecom industry and how the structural asset side of the company is run. It challenges me to be better at my job every day.
good,"Crown Castle is a growth company that offers great benefits and stock options; however, since the company is flat, there isn't a lot of room for upward movement and when there is an opening, there are several candidates waiting for the position.  If you are willing to move out of the current state you live for a new / better role, you will be fine."
good,"Great support system and everyone worked well together. "
good,Crown Castle is a large corporation that owns and operates wireless infrastructure.
good,"Lots of innovative projects, a great story of how Crown Castle grew into the Fiber to the Enterprise verticle, everyone is willing to help. Health benefits are beyond amazing, HSA is like nothing I have received before, and stock shares is exceptional!"
good,The company has grown and still has a good company culture. The company was very good to me. I would recommend Crown Castle for anyone looking for a new job.
good,"Good place to work, ability to grow with a great culture. Hardest part would be the growth and sometimes the constant change can become stressful. Awesome!"
good,Great Company recently going through some challenging expansion and integration challenges. After several years of acquisitions the process of integrating and aligning the various business units has presented some management challenges but also opens up new opportunities for legacy employees.
good,"I loved working at Crown.  The work was engaging and I was very well compensated.  I was on a contract - supposed to be 6 - 12 months, and suddenly my contract was terminated, with no warning, no explanation.  My work product was excellent, and my rate was middle-high for the team."
good,"My superiors cared about work and personnel.  Work/life balance seems to be lacking on the side of more work than ""life"" to meet deadlines.  Communication breakdowns seem to happen too often via not enough people making themselves available for each other, though morale is generally good and the people work hard."
good,Departments vary in consistency for management and training. Great benefits with lots of recent changes in upper management. Good outlook for company results.
good,Management tends to hire referrals and people they know but overall good company.  Advancement opportunities are available when you have the required experience.
good,"Great company, just with that there was job security and advancement opportunities for everyone, not just the favored few. No complaints about the company."
good,"The job was 80+ hrs per week, administrative in nature, using computers ""Microsoft Office Suite"", and very challenging.  I increased my ability to communicate with people more effectively, and to juggle multiple projects with an ever increasing work load.  The executive management team and upper management are phoenominal.  The overall team were great people with a diverse skill set.  The hardest part of the job was overcoming continual and ongoing partner rejection.  The position I held was critical, and sales is in my opinion the most challenging position on the planet.  The most enjoyable part of the job was building and often repairing relationships with business partners."
good,The company seems to be very transparent and willing to work with the employees
good,"Put in the work and the telecommunications world is yours!"
good,Good benefits great place to work for but very difficult to advance with in company. If your content with slow paced work this is the way to go but if your ambitious about advancing your career it will be very hard to move up unless your willing to relocate across the country.
good,"This is a large company with lots of growth opportunities.  However, it can be very stressful and overwhelming.  Typical work day 10-14 hours.  Forget about lunch or any breaks."
good,"I was treated well at Crown Castle."
good,"mgmt. is tough  Mgmt is very set in their ways.  Not very open to new ideas or concepts.  Employee atmosphere is amazing though, and there are a lot of great people that work there."
good,"I have really enjoyed my time with Crown Castle.  My only reason for seeking new opportunities is that as a remote worker, opportunities to advance are few."
good,CCI is a great company that is winning a lot of business.  Would have accepted extension to continue working had the daily commute not exceeded 120  miles.
good,"ok place to work. learned alot, various tools to monitor and troubleshoot issues on numerous equip types. worked with splicers and field techs on fiber trouble issues"
good,Crown Castle gives it's employees ample training and is a good place to work. Their benefits are on par for the industry as is the compensation. Overall 4 out of 5 stars.
good,"Fun place, only hiring externally.  Hard to move up if you don't have previous experience at another company.  Great pay and good benefits.  Recommend for people with previous experience."
good,"This is a great company to work for and they do treat employees well as do contractors however, it would be ideally to work under proper management as at times those who are in management position aren't familiar with the tasks required."
good,"Best company I've ever worked for.  Hard work but fun, challenging, and best database in the USA.  Crown Castle is a company still on the rise and anyone would would be lucky to join their family.  If they invite me back the company I'm with will have to be extra special, or I'm outta there!"
good,"as a project coordinator I spend most of my time tracking purchase orders we receive from our customer, purchase orders I create for our vendors and invoices I issue."
good,A great company to work for. Offers advancement opportunities and many roles within the company. Innovative and moving in a direction to become a leader in fiber networks and project management.
good,Crown Castle is great company. They have great benefits and a work/life balance. The company values their employees by investing time and money into furthering education to insure each employee's knowledge will help them to succeed in their role. The pay is very competitive per each market.
good,"Great company to work for. Allow you to take ownership of your work and make decisions. True believer in B3 values.Allow you to make decisions about quality of work, vendors and no finger pointing."
good,The opportunities for career and educational advancement were instrumental in the successful career I enjoyed for over 25 years. The trust and faith that was given me propelled me to give my all to any projects I was in charge to execute.
good,Enjoyable place to work with challenging assignments.  Spent a lot of time commuting between the office & the job site on a daily basis to manage a 6-month DAS upgrade project. Many project-specific teams consisted of employees physically located at multiple offices throughout the country.
good,Good work life balance. Very flexible hours. Very supportive to go and visit other offices to network within the company. Everyone was willing to help each other.
good,Fast paced environment. Received excellent direction and communication from management. Lists were reviewed on daily basis for work and special instructions for certain requests from manager.
good,Good people to work with. Typical day had many challenges. Learned much about the wireless industry. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked and associated with.
good,wireless is a growing industry so there are many opportunities for learning and development. everyone is generally friendly and willing to help. good benefits and pay.
good,"Excellent workplace. Friendly people. Make sure you are too. Limited opportunity for advancement unless you are free to regularly relocate. Great work life balance. Culture is a big deal for them. You have to be able to fit in to the culture otherwise it will not be a good long term fit. Base salaries are much lower than the industry average, but arguably the benefits make up the difference."
good,While working there i found  there were things i could do that i did not know i had the knowledge to do. I grew a lot there. Most days were fairly easy. The only tough times were when we were on a deadline.
good,"Most management personnel are very professional, almost to a fault. As a large employer, CCI has several departments performing similar tasks and they are not aware or haven't attempted to minimize the cross functions.  The staff &co-workers were always pleasant to work with as was management, but urgency was a one way street so it was hard to ""manage up"" due to slow responses. Coming from a small business environment this was hard to accept. That was as much a function of overworked or undisciplined management as it was the need to streamline processes & procedures and departments.  The least responsive of all was HR and anyone involved with benefits........as poorly devised and managed a department I've ever encountered."
good,Growing company that pays well. I am in search of a full time permanent position because it has a promising future here.
good,You can't beat working for this company if you need a work-life balance. There is respect from Management that you need time with your family and time to exercise.
good,Crown Castle is a good company with projected growth and opportunity.  Work life balance and shift work was available with overtime when hourly.  Bonus structure was for direct employees only.
good,Fantastic place to join as company is diversifying their business - plenty of opportunities coming in the years ahead.  Locations throughout the US. Stable company environment
good,"Good work life balance and coworkers. "
good,"Very nice place to work.  Very employee oriented company.  Chance at regular pay increases and plenty of overtime.  Many, many employee benefits offered such as they payed for your gym expenses while you were on the road traveling as a consequence of work."
good,"Crown Castle owns, operates, and leases towers and other communication structures for wireless communications. Crown Castle offers significant wireless communications coverage to 91 of the top 100 US markets and to substantially all of the Australian population. Crown Castle owns, operates and manages over 22,000 and approximately 1,600 wireless communication sites in the US and Australia, respectively."
good,"Overall, my experience with Crown Castle has been great. Our office is diverse, but very close. A typical day involves emailing, attending and/or leading meetings, and working on projects. I learned a lot about permitting and business financials. Management is great. You have autonomy, but they are there to answer questions. It's a large company, with a small company feel. Our office is very family-oriented. The hardest part of the job is having to coordinate with other people outside of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is collaborating with other employees."
good,"Management is not good, he smile all the time, but watch out your back."
good,"Great place to work, as they feed you catered lunch every Friday. But my manager had favorites and although a group of us had worked there longer and she told us we did excellent work with NO complaints. She didnâ€™t promote us like she did other people. I really liked working there but had to move on since my Worth was not taken seriously."
good,"typical work day would be preparing for upcoming projects"
good,Crown Castle is a great company to work for. Very family oriented and enjoyable environment. Lots of hard work is required but they take care of their employees.
good,"Great place to work! good work-life balance and collaborative culture, you have the opportunity to work with the best talent and Crown Castle has amazing benefits and perks."
good,"Supportive, tech savvy estoppel and land acquisitions work in a contract setting on a large telecommunications merger assignment."
good,Nice Company to work for. Great experience. Learn about RF engineering and management.
good,"Crown Castle is a great company to work for.  It is a fast paced environment, but worth the effort.  Crown Castle strives to ensure its employees are treated fairly.  I have never worked at another company like Crown Castle who goes out of their way to support their employees morale with their off site Kickoff meetings and training courses.  Crown Castle consistently focuses on uplifting services for their Customers with happy employees, because they care about their employees!"
good,I worked for Crown Castle as a contractor and I came to find that they do most of their hiring on a contract basis so many employees are not even full time Crown employees.  I find this method not only does not promote trust between employee and employer but it drives contractors away from the company in search of full time work.
good,Growing at a fast rate. And getting bigger. Not a lot of advancement. I needed a change of environment. But I would recommend it.
