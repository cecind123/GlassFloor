rating,review
bad,"Preferential treatment, unnecessary org changes resulting in layoffs, overpaid-under-qualified leadership, lack of direction, no brand cohesion, no cross division employee engagement"
bad,"I’ve worked for several companies, but this was my worse experience by far. My manager had no respect for her team members. I don’t recommend working for PL in their life insurance division in Aliso Viejo. I hear that the location in Newport has a different culture."
bad,"Worst company to work for."
bad,"I was hired on in October 2010 and went through a very extensive training stint that lasted 4 weeks to pass the series 6 license with a class of 12 people.  Once we all passed the series 6, two people were forced out.  ( I think they over hired thinking that some wouldn't pass the series 6) "
bad,"Everything seems OK when you first get there… Until it’s time for you to advance. Management claims that they want to promote from within, however when the time comes they never want to promote internal employees. They would rather bring in someone from the outside and have the fully capable people inside train the outside people. There are a select few who do care about you however they have no power to make any executive decisions. If you do not kiss butt,you will not get anywhere."
bad,"This company is a very risky option if you are thinking about working with them.  I had 4 interviews with them and they demonstrated a great deal of shady behavior during the interview process.  I was constantly provided conflicting information from different people. I was asked the same questions multiple times and they were non-responsive. It just felt very unorganized and unprofessional.  Just be careful, pay attention to the signs and proceed with caution."
bad,Management cared more about profits than their employees. The first three years our office was busy and when the market dropped in 2008 the customer service focus and contract processing accuracy declined. Management was more concerned about the benchmark numbers than their employees.
bad,"Pacific Life as a company is really amazing. The Minneapolis office is not representative of the company. Ineffective management, aggressive micromanagement, and constant tension made me move to another life carrier."
bad,It is hard to advance unless you are a part of the inner circle. Hard work sometimes pays off. They provide fun learning opportunities and participate in lots of charitable events.
bad,"Pacific Life should change their name to Petty Life. The employees constantly tattle tale on one another. The managers walk around with a chip on their should like their kings and queens and their employees are peasants. The culture at this company is just terrible. You're treated like a CHILD!! In order to advance with this company, you have to be really good at kissing butt."
bad,"The managers on my floor did not know what they were doing. They tried to create a team atmosphere but in the end they only worried about their own personal success.  Constantly tried to tell you that you would move on to a new role or to a different department, yet they put a stop to any chance you had once they found out you applied to another team. They do not communicate to you clearly and do not know the process they supposedly ""manage."" "
bad,"Great company, not so great people to work with. People have Passive Aggressive attitude which is quite hard to work with. Very quite and the walls of the cubicle are so big you could hardly see any one."
bad,"This employer offers great benefits, as a single mom with three children, take full advantage of what they offer to their employees. the management will make you feel like a slave."
bad,If you like sitting in a cubicle being micromanaged this is the place for you.
bad,People either do not want to leave their position because they have been here forever or they don't see a point in moving up a level. Management is partial to long term employees and gives step treatment to Contractors.
bad,Definitely not the greatest company to work for in Orange County. There is not much room for advancement and the pay is below industry standards.
bad,Local boys club mentality for any promotions or opportunities that opened up. Miserable micromanagement and yearly commission pay cuts based on rising goals
bad,Never believe what management tells you.  Upper Management in IT believes they are better than the people who report to them.  The culture is a save yourself at the expense of others.
bad,Company dynamic has shifted to a win at all costs environment.   managers lead by fear and threats.  very unethical in the RSD department. The money is not worth the stress.
bad,"The cloud transformation program is a rudderless ship, with little hope of reaching shore any time soon.  Unclear objectives, chronic waste on endless vendor engagements, and misleading management round things out."
bad,"If you work outside of sales management, this is the worst corporate meat grinder around. No matter how qualified you are for a position their human resources department will find something to deem you under qualified for any position and low ball their offer. No one except for national sales managers or VP's and above will have the opportunity to make enough to live within 10 miles of the corporate head quarters. If you really have to accept a position here, expect about a 2% raise every year for good work. Be prepared to train yourself as no department I've seen makes on boarding and training a priority for non sales positions, and the old technology will stress you out if the managers talking to you like they are robots doesn't first."
bad,The Company has many issues with employees being happy because management is unaware of the job they were hired to do.  The Supervisors who conduct the one on one employee meetings are texting on their cell phones.  The Supervisors also will not help help in the daily work queues because they state that they are only hired to provide coaching and not assistance with the work.  The Supervisors are not knowledgeable on the work items that are completed day-by-day by the staff.  If you are lucky enough to get another job in the Company you are still required to help your old department if you are low on work. This is without additional pay.
bad,"Not a lot of opportunity to move up within the organization.  Very little flexibility.  Penalties for being 5-10 minutes late were routine.  I found this extremely challening.  Lots of expectations that were ""unwritten and poorly communicated"".  Not a culture of mentorship."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of answering phone calls and customer service regarding claims. I learned the value of dedication and active listening.
bad,The days go by fast at this company. Months soon turn into years as the work makes time fly. The weekends were too short and the weekdays too long to work the same duties over and over. The company manages risk and they do not take any. Temporary workers are a big part of the company.
bad,The job is very challenging and constantly changing the way you process the work weekly. There are so many cases you receive and it is impossible to be trained accurately on the job. You have weekly meetings with your supervisor discussing your performance which puts you under a lot of pressure and makes the job even more challenging and stressful. With so many different job procedures you have to follow it is very easy to make errors. The job is very stressful and mentally exhausting.
bad,"Like a lot of companies doing well, and flush with new tax cuts, they are using this windfall to find ways to reduce staff. Since COO take over of IT, they have started bringing in management types who share the ""employees are a burden"" mentality, and who conveniently work on the other side of the country so they don't have to deal with the staff they're dealing with. So now the company is in the beginning phase of outsourcing as many as possible (as most companies are bringing staff back in-house). "
bad,Management structure and support lacking. PMO formal structure lacking. they have no concept of planning for future projects. Projects would initiate without warning with the expectation of assigning resources that were already allocated to other projects.
good,"Company is a great place to work if you are in the right department. Sadly, they allow their management to create empires with their own family and friends as opposed to hiring real talent."
good,"It is not a great place to work, the setup of the cubicles keeps employees very isolated. Managers do not have daily interaction with employees and employees that have been working there for longer time do not accept new employees in their circle. Excellent environment for people that only goes to work for a paycheck."
good,I am very grateful I worked for this organization.  I met a lot talented smart people in which we all collaborated to meet with the organizational's goals
good,The company needs to work on adherence to policy and appropriate action to violations of hippa and overall treatment of contractors by employees some employees are not very accepting of contractors
good,"Management did not care about their employees. They only cared about those that were their ""favorites"" & if you weren't among that group, you were just a number to them. Corporate did take care of us by way of benefits to an extent, but in afterthought, the benefits we were provided came at a fairly high price for individuals that worked there. I learned to do as I'm told, when I'm told, be seen & not heard...yes, they treated us like kindergartners. & if we bucked the system at all, were were reprimanded & humiliated. I'm very surprised that I survived there as long as I did with how unhappy I was."
good,"Had an amazing time with my peers (team) they helped so much whenever I had questions. "
good,"Company is downsizing and outsourcing to India. Very fast paced work environment. Micromanaged. Some Supervisors are great, others not so much. Job culture going through changes"
good,"A typical day at Pacific Life was to manage my assigned projects. Since the project environment is forever changing, this made the job both interesting and challenging. But I would adapt new methods for managing my projects, and my team consistently worked their project assignments and work well together."
good,"Nothing special, typical cubicle workplace. Management lacks the necessary tools to lead by example.  The higher you're promoted, the less responsibilities you have"
good,"Good place to work at depending on department and manager you work for. For some departments, morale is very bad and employees feel their recommendations go to deaf years by management."
good,"The management is old-school typical corporate groupthink. Unfortunately, politics abounds and innovative thinking does not seem to be valued. However, salary and benefits are decent. I was weirded out by the fact that they had Fox News playing nonstop in the company cafeteria.  Can you get any more overtly political than that?"
good,"A friendly environment, and a very collegial.  Deadlines are pretty flexible.  Birthdays are celebrated each month within department/group, and employees or department provide cake, breakfast or lunch."
good,A typical day at work involved regulatory review and updating various divisions on requirements as applicable to them. I learned more about the insurance industry had professional relationships with my co-workers. The job was not hard.
good,It was alright working here at this company. Good benefits overall. Lots of office politics just like any other company. Worked with many talented people.
good,"As a customer service representative the work was extremely fast paced and demanding which was fine. Within the company the men who worked there were appropriate in their behavior towards and around women, the clients and financial advisors were not. I was continuously sexually harassed by financial advisors and made to listen to crude jokes and inappropriate comments from them with little to no recourse for me as they were the customer that I needed to serve."
good,A typical day at the office is basically sitting in front of a computer in a cubicle either taking phone calls or processing work items depending on your job duties.  Upper management are friendly and personable.  A very structured and micromanaged workplace culture. Very challenging and requires a lot of learning which is good.  Most enjoyable part of the job are the friends you find along the way.
good,"Pacific Life's people are the best part of the job. I enjoyed working with many of the co-workers and management. Due to recent changes in the industry, job security is not a guarantee."
good,"Good Benefits, Good learning experience, good location and great cafe at the facility. No Coffee/Tea for the employees."
good,"I feel the management could have been better. They really treated some employees poorly. As an outsider looking in, it was really uncomfortable to watch."
good,Great place for a temp job to learn the industry. Communication and training were top notch
good,"There's certain positions that require the SIE, Series 6 & 7 licensing. If you don't pass after two tries, you're terminated. That being said - make sure you're a good test taker or complete the exams before applying. "
good,"Pacific Life has deemed it necessary to get rid of IT employees, to be replaced with a consulting agency.  Never did they hold it's current employees accountable, and it created a complacent environment.  Very silo'd departments.  Unfortunate, because I want to work for the Whale, not a consulting agency."
good,the company was great been there for over  20 years good benefits great employees. Management shukd have taken better care of their employess especialy rhe ones that have been there for over 20 years
good,The hardest part of the job is that you have to work overtime to get your work done at quarterend.  Management keep pushing you to take more responsibility which is more than you can handle.
good,"Manage application development project, coordinate meetings, communicate to stakeholders and champions, check status with development team and manage project budget."
good,"Productivity, drive, and innovation lack due to employees who have been there for decades, some in same positions/departments. Many ""old school minded"" are not receptive to new blood and ideas on efficiency and improvements."
good,"Overall culture is solid, but the training and onboarding process is not optimal.  Also, job resources are not up to date, which makes finding correct information difficult."
good,Good first job out of school. Nothing too difficult. Management are life time employees with no outside work experience which might be there down fall
good,"PL as a whole is a wonderful and good company. When you drill down and take a closer look inside each department; that’s when the disturbing differences start to appear. Appearances are deceiving and there are directors and managers who will form an alliance to cover each other’s backs against those who work hard all year are picked on, scrutinized, belittled, and micromanaged to each minute. Rules get broken among middle management."
good,I was always impressed with the desire to keep in front of new technology.  This can also become an obstacle. It can lead to the desires of a view become declared as policy.
good,Despite growing pains with creating a new division the company takes care of its employees with an exceptional benefits package.Time is provided to balance work life and home life.
good,"Even though I’m a contractor this has been an excellent assignment with Pacific Life. I’ve been apart of a ServiceNow upgrade, Office365 migration and getting current in a lot of newer applications I wasn’t familiar with and build up my resume/experience a bit. "
good,it a very easy job. And management encourages growth. A lot of the people that work here have been here for years. Opportunity to move up within the company is great! Depending on what department you're looking for.
good,I served as an Advisor and assisted the Branch manager with Securities based products and the training of independent brokers and agents. I operated my practice in investments and insurance.
good,"Pacific Life provides commercial real estate finance and investment expertise in support of its life insurance, investment and retirement solutions businesses as well as for its private party and securitized servicing clients."
good,I learned a lot of technology and was paid to do it.  It is easy to stay onsite for lunch because the cafe is in the building.  A chance to work with some really great people.
good,"Pacific Life was a fun and motivating, always had hands on thing/ activities to do. A lot of learning online. People their were generally nice and easy to work with."
good,My husband and I have decided to relocate to the Pacific Northwest.  I enjoy working for Pacific Life and would probably not be leaving if there was an opportnuity for transfer to a position in the Pacific Northwest.
good,A very fast paced environment with continua changes. Management is very intuitive and always looking for ways to improve the organization.
good,Company has good benefits and a relaxed dress code. Enjoying your experience here truly depends on the department you end up in. They let you leave early on days before major holidays and most locations have a subsidized cafeteria. 
good,"I like my job, and I believe that management is doing their best at keeping up with caring for subordinates while balancing their busy schedule."
good,There is a some issue with non managerial career growth. Company is working to make work environment more millennial friendly. Lots of long tenured employees
good,"The company as a whole is good. The pay is good and the benefits are great. It all depends on your department. In the department I was in, there supervisors were friends with the manager. You couldn't trust saying something in a 1-1 that would be repeated and would come back to you. No one soaks up on real issues for fear of retaliation."
good,"Great people, but as the company got bigger we started to lose the ""get the job done"" culture that had been there when I first started.  Became more structured and obstructive."
good,A typical day for me at Pacific Life was establishing and maintaining relationships with Life Insurance Producers through calls and sales campaigns. Prospected through cold calls and provided leads to the Territory Regional Vice President. Scheduled meetings and follow-up for the Regional Vice President with Life Insurance producers.
good,"Pay and work is decent. Would not pay for additional training. Trained myself up, am about to leave. Bosses have been discussing growing our data field. I found a program to learn more, work didn't cover any. I am taking what I learned and want to go to a place that values what I value."
good,"Friendly collaborative environment, supportive management, accountable people.  The hardest part of the job is the manual processes coupled with tight deadlines."
good,"I liked working for PL.  I liked the location and the folks I met there.  I want to go back.  To me, working there, and with 90% of the people I did work with, it was like one BIG family and I miss that environment or feeling."
good,"I enjoyed reaching out to and collaborating with multiple departments on several different high priority projects. However, recent changes in the financial services industry coupled with reduced sales ultimately made the work environment much more stressful and much less flexible."
good,"Assisted underwriters with the evaluation of applications to determine degree of risk of an individual. Helped evaluate client's medical history, acting as the intermediary between underwriters and producers."
good,Great structure to the life division with separate areas working in unison to meet the business need.
good,People you work with are amazing.   The core values and culture is a direct reflection of the people.  I enjoy the extra fun activities.  Some room for growth.
good,This is a great place to work.  Lacks training in some areas that can make the job stressful. Room for advancement. Co-workers were great and so was the manager.
good,Company is innovative with new software and procedures to keep up to date with the current trends.  Environment is professional and fast paced.  Encourages volunteering for charitable events.
good,"The title pretty much says it all. The Annuity Product Specialist role is actually a Customer Service role. You're on the phone 8 hours a day, constantly criticized for how you could do better on the calls through reviews and not really given an opportunity to grow, with 0 flexibility or control over your own schedule. The division is currently under new management, which is terrible. Maybe things will go back to being normal, but the company's been going through non-stop restructuring for about 2 years now with no signs of slowing down."
good,The management has a lot of bureaucracy. It is difficult to get things done because most people that work there are complacent and have very low sense of urgency
good,A typical day was running non-stop all day.  We cared about our clients and worked hard to deliver good results.  The hardest part of my job was being laid-off and being concerned about our sales force moving forward and the support provided to their clients.
good,"I enjoyed the beautiful building, location, on-site cafeteria. Professional workmates. Business casual. They have a host of learning opportunities (classroom and on-line)."
good,Plenty of chances for advancement. Fast pace inviroment.  Employees work as a team.  The benefits are with employees needs taken into consideration. The company is community involved.
good,"Great people; lack data, clear communications, and processes.  Leadership is gaining traction, but processes and accountability needs improvement.  Emphasis on work life balance."
good,"Pacific Life has great benefits and training opportunities."
good,My typical work days at PL has been relaxing. Low stress environment with plenty of time to finish work. However this may be different depending on who the manager is.
good,"Typical Day at Work:"
good,"Due to technology departments being merged, I was put into a position (in July, 2013) for which I was not a good fit."
good,Outbound Sales calls throughout the day. Meetings with Brokers on business travel once a month.
good,Working at Pacific Life is a really great experience. Lots of opportunities and very friendly work environment. There are also plenty of lunch options conveniently located at walking distance downtown.
good,"Long term employee who has made valuable contributions (at least i think so).  Have learned many things over my tenure, led great teams and delivered quality solutions.  The people and talent have always been paramount but that seems to be changing.  With management decision to increase offshoring the staff will be minimized and the company may lose the entrepreneurial spirit it once had."
good,Culture is client orientated and Management is always willing to assist on growth and opportunities.  Company goes the extra mile when it comes to training their associates and implement the latest technologies and software to insure learning is efficient and innovative.
good,My 18 years working experience at Pacific Life was overall good. The benefits are very good. The employees are well educated and good to work with.  Management has of course changed over the years and has continued to be good to employees.  There is considerable pressure on employees to produce at required levels.  There is often overtime needed. Management could use managing continuing education.
good,"- Great culture"
good,"I had a good time at Pacific Life Re."
good,"Coffee is available for $$ at the cafeteria. Really? Doesn't management know that caffeine fuels Information Technology? Also, expect a lot of meetings."
good,Pacific Life is very team oriented with team members always willing to lend a hand and always willing to help you learn. Communicated with team members very well and nobody ever felt left out. Management made sure we remained on task without spying and hovering over us. Environment was very positive and uplifting.
good,"Pacific Life is a solid company that is slowly moving forward to be more progressive with the work life balance.  "
good,Workplace culture is relaxed collaborative and competitive.  Company participates in plenty of volunteer projects.  Very good about work life balance.
good,Absolutely amazing place to work! Learned a lot and gained great experience! Would recommend definitely for people who wants to be bright and visible at their positions.
good,"A good stable company with several employees working for over 20 years, even retired from it. Good work life balance. good benefits, decent pay, cafeteria on site."
good,"Friendly, good atmosphere. Follows mission and vision, puts customers first. Building is in a great location, and co-workers are not only nice, but there is an excellent team dynamic."
good,Good place to work. Fast paced environment. People are friendly. Office space is modern and updated. Room for advancement within the company. Benefits are good.
good,A company with strong management that embraced their employees and assured that everyone was properly trained/competent in every task.
good,Great Work Life Balance - slow to adapt to new technology. Most people have stayed in the company for 10+ years. People are wonderful.
good,Friendly family oriented secure work place with low employee turnover ratio.
good,"Never a typical day. Resolve server issues."
good,"Poised to contribute unique blend of sales, project-management, and exemplary customer-support skills, along with commitment to excellence, to your firm’s value by ensuring that projects support strategic mission and objectives within scope, budget, and schedule."
good,"This was a great place to work, with wonderful benefits and great managers.  They are trying to save money so I am not sure about the job security in the Omaha area they have already removed the life department."
good,Able to learn a lot from AVPs and senior corporate actuary. Good office culture. Often has events to celebrate and take good care of their employees. Appreciate feedbacks from employees.
good,Pacific Life is a collaborative culture that has long-tenured employees that are enjoyable to work with. It is a very ethical company. They often feel slow to change and bureaucratic at times. The work-life balance here is excellent. I have had plenty of opportunities to grow within my role and advance my career.
good,I loved working at Pacific Life for over 15 years in two locations and 2 different Departments within the RSD Division. I leave behind many friends and professional colleagues that I will miss.
good,"The work day involved reviewing over-payment reports from outside recovery vendors, adjusted the claims identified and forwarding the results to our home office. "
good,"People here are very social and approachable. Employees will help anyway that they can and if they can't then they will send you to somebody that will. You can depend on everybody to help and provide you feedback if you ask. "
good,"Held several different positions while working for PL. Great company, lot's of opportunity."
good,I received outstanding training and support from this company. They recently purchased an office building in Aliso Viejo. Most people have been with this organization for many years.
good,"Pacific Life offers a positive and professional corporate environment.  It helped me learn a lot about working for a Fortune 500 company and also understanding the complexities of the financial services industry."
good,"Good company, great benefits, you need to be comfortable in an office/call center environment.  Most of the jobs are phone related so it’s a bit of a grind.  Their new building though is amazing and they do allow quite a bit of freedom."
good,I liked my manager and daily meeting. good culture. We met every morning as triage and went over the daily tasks and it did help a lot with productivity.
good,Great place to work. It is my second home. People work as a team.
good,Working at Pacific Life was a different experience for me. The work was easy and rewarding. If I had it to do over I probably should have stayed because I could be a VP by now.
good,"It was obvious that the small group health insurance was about to be eliminated with the emergence of HIPP and ACC, we were still held accountable even though the company was about to sell out or drop all policies."
good,I was very sad to go. My husband was relocated to Phoenix Arizona in 2006. I was hoping to retire from Pacific Life. When I worked in the warehouse it was fun and productive. Then I was moved upstairs to perform customer service duties. I started at the bottom I moved my way up. I would recommend Pacific Life to anyone who is interested stop. I loved the job.
good,Assisted with collating files and organizing events. Recorded and transferred confidential information for those who attended these events.
good,"Great company to work for.  Values ethics, culture, and work/home balance.  Competitive pay and fair benefits.  Not many companies like this left."
good,Great opportunity to build from in the financial industry. The training is great and most of the people are great and opening.
good,"great benefits,  good advancement opportunities,"
good,I truly enjoyed starting at the mail desk and moving up thru the administration department and then training co-workers in the department functions.
good,"Typical day included supporting end users on systems, processes, procedures, etc."
good,"Pacific Life believes in developing their employees. They seek to provide excellent customer service to both internal and external customers. It's fast paced and you must be quick on your feet with a smile on your face. If you can handle that, they pay well and it's possible to move between departments."
good,"Pacific Life is a great, 150-year old company with long-term thinking upper management.  The overall work culture is very employee centric."
good,"While wholesaling at Pacific Life my duties included wholesaling annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and long term care. I have experience and relationships in all channels of distribution, primarily in the Pacific Northwest."
good,Better management needed! Co-workers great to work with and the hardest part of the job were the micro managers.
good,Everything is paper still. You do it on the computer and print it for authorization. It has been a couple years so they may have moved to electronic records by now. They are old and slow but stable. There isn't a lot of excitement but that leave a pretty relaxed mentality. You don't take work home and you aren't stressed out. Advancement is hard as they aren't growing quickly and so you have to wait for your leaders to retire or leave to move up. Play your hand right and you can do it.
good,Solid company with great long term benefits.  People are nice and team players.  Company always trying to stay ahead of the times and keep up with technology.
good,"This company has great benefits, but opportunities for advancement are non-existient. The ability to work remote is non-existient, the company needs to get into the 21st century."
good,A great place to work! Working to change an older culture and making strives to do so. There are many people who care and have been there for a long time. Management has recently changed and is heading in the right direction.
good,"Pacific Life is a good company with options for advancement.  The benefits package is one of the best parts of working for the company.  The management is good and there is a decent amount of focus on individual goals and advancement with support from management. The company is very open to department changes if it aligns better with your overall career goals. Overall, the employees are friendly and helpful."
good,"A typical day would involve following up on cases, communicating with agents and staff, telephone calls and data entry."
good,"Great place to work. Good benefits, pursuing excellence in leadership, employee engagement, focusing on goal setting and meaningful conversations between management and employees."
good,"Systems Analyst job was steady, but not the most exciting. Did get to learn a lot about Excel and VBA. Difficult sometimes to translate documents from other departments, as there was a bit of a disconnect between what they wanted and what we could do within our system limitations. Loved the people I worked with."
good,"The day would start off with receiving phone calls from either providers or the insured.  I also processed medical insurance claims by either paying or denying those claims.  The management was overall functional.  I made several friends and still keep in contact with one of them when I moved back up north.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the needs of the providers in a timely manner due to insurance companies not paying claims on time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my other co-workers, and the company woud host celebrations at ball parks, restaraunts."
good,Pacific Life is a good company to work for. They work with your schedule if you have family items
good,Pacific Life is a great company that takes good care of its people. Great benefits and amenities in the facility. They are also very involved in the community.
good,"Projects are the best part of this job.  We do proof of concept with many products before purchasing products.  It is great to be able to test out products before implementation.  This company also has Test, Model and Production environments so all updates and new products can be tested before going into a Production environment.  I have grown tremendously with this company.  I love that I can work on all the different areas of Systems and Network Administration.   On all sides of Windows, Linux, VMware and NetApp Storage.  Never a boring or mundane day."
good,"A typical day at work started with opening all programs including state websites. Reading all emails and listening to messages. Working on follow up with customers and representatives. Processing all licensing and appointments for representatives to sell Pacific Life products. Insure that all licenses and appointments for reps were up to date. Obtained outstanding  paperwork to complete appoints for reps. Made all necessary payments and adjustments to representatives commission payments. Consulted with Broker Dealers and representatives to gather information and answer questions. Trained fellow employees when required. Updated job aids and shared ideas for improving processes within the department. Work to meet deadlines that coincide with the market. I did feel after 10 years that I was ready to move on and start a new chapter. To be honest I did get a bit burned out and wanted to something new. The culture at Pacific life was terrific. You felt like you were family, especially after being there so long. I miss everyone of them."
good,People come to Pacific Life to work and end up finding a life and family.  The work is rewarding and beneficial.
good,Great business to work with.
good,The company is positioned for growth and the leadership at the top levels is fantastic.  Wonderful company to work for as many people have been with the company for many years.
good,A good company to work for. Employees have been around for over 15-20 years. Management is appreciative. Work life balance is good. Work environment is supportive and encourages learning.
good,"Honestly, super good company to work for. Good benefits, and mostly the compensation is seen through that. Pay is not the greatest, I know people that have recieved only 3$ in raises over 5 years. Consistent and reliable company. Culture is incredibly supportive and friendly."
good,"I've only ever worked here and have enjoyed its people and culture immensely. I have learned everything from here and have seen it grow culturally, as well as it become very adaptive based on the market and its own product offerings. It does have red tape and politics."
good,"I am self motivated and very productive at work I am self driven towards learning. My strong accounting skills are AP, AR, journal entries, month end, bank reconciliation and account reconciliation-revenue, expense, accrued, prepaid and asset accounts. I have internal audit experience of 3 years."
good,"I can't say enough good things about my time with Hatch Labs. Management is extremely flexible with school schedules, personal needs, etc. Pay is great, for an internship. There are no comparable full time positions at Pacific Life, but management is happy to write letters of recommendation and allow time off for job interviews. An awesome experience!"
good,"I worked at Pacific Life for almost a year and it was a great company to work for. I felt job security, supported by my coworkers and supervisors and enjoyed learning the foundations of life insurance. This company cares about their impact on their employees, customers, and community. I gained a new and deeper level of operations and quality experience and loved being able to problem solve on a daily basis."
good,I can't say enough great things about this Company and it's leadership. I'm blessed to have had my time with such an amazing group to professionals.  The best in the business!
good,"Great place to work. High standards as a company to be proud of. They really promote within and encourage employee development."
