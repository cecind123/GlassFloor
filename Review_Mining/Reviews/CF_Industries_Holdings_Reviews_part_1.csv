rating,review
bad,This company Not recommended in its present management style. last ceo did a very good job of improving the company. the company went down as soon he left.
bad,"poor management, high pace for low dollars. worst company to work for. the only thing good about this company is profit sharing, sadly that's it. what did I learn NOTHING! very stressful, didn't get trained for anything it was a sink or swim job. no room to advance anywhere."
bad,"The culture at CF is very bad, no humanity, management is very difficult to work with.  The workload is impossible, the hours are 12-14 hours and there is no work/life balance"
bad,Management would not direct or set any daily plans in place.  New employees were left to just follow around other employees.  No direction from management.
bad,"It was the worst company I ever worked for in my 28 years of career experience.  I walked into a layoff in the first week of January, without any explanation, after completing my last project a month ahead of schedule and within budget."
bad,"zero work life balance"
bad,"Very bad company to work for.  They are constantly looking for people because they don't stay after the find out work/employment environment. Procurement Manager is a Black Widow, man hater and will stab you in the back if you don't grovel at her feet.  She doesn't tolerate others opinion or questions."
bad,Employee morale is low and many employees are looking to move elsewhere. Management makes employees work short staffed and the workload keeps building along with the pressure to perform. Management is also inexperienced
bad,"Probably too laid back, as there was no guidance in prioritization of work and no training in legacy work processes.  Good bonus program, good benefits, very good safety culture, but you need to find somebody who is willing to help you figure out the unique work processes."
bad,"It could be so good, but really isn't. I've come to believe that people only really stay here for the money and benefits, which are quite good. Diversity here is an abhorrent joke. Extreme favoritism and judgement are rampant."
bad,"Do it Right is the slogan. It should be “Do it right now, with no money or resources”. Some of the shadiest, most unethical things I’ve seen in my career."
bad,The company needs more diversity and needs more training. There is no training. They rely on new people to train new hires. Managers don't know how to properly manage and can be extremely rude.
bad,"There was no such thing as a ""typical day"" being a security guard. It was impossible to predict what could happen or what routine work would get interrupted. Management and chain of command was extremely structured but hard to figure out which orders to follow. The hardest part of the job was that because I was trying to be completely alert throughout my entire shift was mentally draining."
bad,Training for new hires needs to be better. Management just throws you out to the wolves and its not that safe. Have to always go out searching for help because it will not be given to you.
good,"Depending on who you work for determines the opportunities you have in the future.  CF has changed philosohies over the years.  Their are not as many benefits to work at CF anymore.  The biggest beyond the pay check benefits are: Pension, Health Insuracnce, and savings matching."
good,"CF Industries offers exceptional benefits and pay for employees, however, the stress level at manufacturing facilities is very high due to the constant turnover in site leadership."
good,"Work life balance is off with growing pains of organization. Management is aware, but progress is slow to do anything about it. Benefits are good and pay is competitive."
good,My experience there can’t speak for the entire company I was singled out for several small things that everyone else was able to to and not be brought up
good,"I decided that I no longer wanted to work full time, so I seeked part time employment.  I truly enjoyed the actual work that was required of me..  A majority of the time I felt like I was working in an adult male day care.  Lots of talking, and joking, and playing tricks and jokes on each other.  I prefer a quieter working environment with less unnecessary interruptions that had nothing to do with the job."
good,Great day at work 
good,Job wasnt bad and id work there again if im needed. I worked 84 hours a week. Lots of down time. My welds there was all stainless steel and carbon steel..
good,"Turnover has been higher than the norm for CF.  Culture has changed in the past 5 years, with management changes from the CEO downwards. There are good people working at CF, depending on your management team."
good,Start at 7:30am - Leave at 6:00/6:30pm. People are great. Cafeteria on site. Gym benefits a plus. Highly intelligent management team who strives for all to excel.
good,It's a slow paced environment. The work isn't all that challenging. It just wasn't my cup of tea.  Some would find the environment very relaxed but be prepared to be a small fish in a big sea.
good,The benefits are great and the pay scale is tops for the area. But they over hire and you compete to stay on board. Safety department is small but they do a great job. A safe and clean place to work.
good,"Pays great but doesn't encourage innovation. Everything is reviewed multiple times. It's as though employees are not trusted to do it right, which is their motto."
good,"challenging, constant change, stressfull , well compensated,"
good,Great benefits. Kind group of people.  Great location. Hours work well with my schedule.  Great opportunity to learn. There is plenty of work to keep you busy and plenty to learn.
good,I go to work and help workers fit pipes and get tools for workers.I learned how to fit pipes. The management is alright. My co-workers are friendly and good workers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the people who don't follow the rules and guidelines. The most enjoyable part of my job is just being out there and making money.
good,"CF is a still a bottom-up run company.  Corporate has not established expectations and let’s each plant run themselves.  The plants want direction, but they don’t get it from Corporate."
good,"Working for this company was extremely difficult. No one wanted to train you or even try and help, it was more of a ""you do what I tell you and figure it out."" Was placed into high level meetings with little to no knowledge of what to say because my manager went to Italy."
good,"if you like doing the same thing day in day out... advancement is foreseeable, bonuses were ok, people were the best apart until they either retired  or quit. all new hires were not as friendly....."
good,"The office environment was largely pleasant; the people there were excellent to work with, people would talk to each other regularly, and events would occur with a fairly regular basis that people could partake in, providing free food and snacks.  The cafeteria attached between several of the buildings was excellent, and the office provided a healthy discount there, making it extremely reasonable."
good,"manager and team members are cooperated in work and very cooperative in critical time of work. "
good,CF Industries Provided me with lots of hands-on experience in the ammonia process.  I was able to work with Hysys as well as other design software. I was also able to work on safety projects that would better the facility.
good,CF Industries is a great place to work with safety being your number one goal. My unit does everything as a team. You qualified on every job until you became a board operator. Operations got involved with every aspect of the job.
good,My experience with the company was fairly positive. There is a large emphasis on safety and plenty of training opportunities.
good,CF Industries is a fair employer with a good work life balance. Local management had clear expectations and created a family atmosphere.  Being able to contribute and respected was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,The company is a very fast paced demanding IPO company. CF Industries is on top of the pile when it comes to the producers of fertilizers. Be prepared for an extremely busy life style.
good,A company like CF doesn't come knocking at your door often. It is a great company to work for and the company takes care of its employees. All in all very pleased.
good,"CF is well organized. Truly is safety conscious. Other major plants in Sarnia say they are, but CF walks the talk. Unfortunately,  permanent positions are hard to come by and corporate cutbacks make jib security as bad as anywhere else."
good,"It was not a hard job, but I worked in a lab and I really didn't enjoy being stuck in the lab all day. It is a pretty good company to work for. They are your average publicly traded corporation."
good,The people at the Medicine Hat plant are awesome. Many of the operators and maintenance personnel have been here for their entire careers. The workload and work-life balance are great but there is limited opportunities to advance.
good,"When I worked for CF I spent my time checking the perimiter of a 15 acre complex to watch for trespasser, Line leakages, power outages. And when require cleared driveways and sidewalks.. The company was always fair in their treatment of me."
good,The pay and benefits are top of the line. Shift work is 4 days on an 4 days off which you will be required to work OT if necessary then you work 4 nights an 4 days off.  People you work with daily are some of the best.
good,I left due to a forced relocation to Chicago IL.  I was part of the Terra Industries purchase and survived the initial layoffs.  Eventually was asked to move.
good,"Admiration of products/services"
good,This company helped me learn the professional communication skills and basic excel skills needed to be successful in an corporate environment.  As a producer/manufacturer they are at top of the industry food-chain.
good,I have had a great time working on projects with CF Industries my bosses a great people who care about your success. I really love the flexiable hours.
good,Enjoyed working there and sorry I left without investigation of area I moved to. Terrific associates and vendors with most having a good attitude. Worked together to obtain our tasks at hand.
good,CF Industries is a place to learn and grow. Different areas of work with great leaders to teach you. It was great to work around people from other countries.
good,"I really admire this company, which few people even in the area know about but has a fiercely loyal workforce and ambitious management. In the decade since it has gone public, this company has grown to become one of the biggest, most profitable companies in the country and one of the largest producers of Nitrogen fertilizer in the world. It is also full of people who have worked there for many, many years, and who love it so much they do not want to retire. I have worked many places, but few instill the passion amongst its employees that this one does."
good,"Excellent job, many co-workers willing to help train.  Friendly atmosphere with management.  Lots of job related material to train with.  Enjoyed camaraderie and friendship of other coworkers."
good,"A lot of people who work at CF are from the same area which led to a great camaraderie between everyone at the plant.  Everyone is always willing to help another out.  Very friendly atmosphere whether you're dealing with engineering, operations, or management."
good,"Typical day:"
good,"Excellent workplace environment with a continual focus on technical learning, improvement, and a culture that demands excellence in all aspects of technical oversight."
good,I enjoyed working at CF industries.  The workplace culture was the best part of this job.  They made you feel like you were part of a family.  The hardest part of the job was the location for me.
good,"Productive safe work environment, excellent pay...Great Job!!!"
good,A lot of responsibility overseeing over 8500 personnel.  Safety was extremely important going from inert to a live plant.  General knowledge of all aspects of the construction process is vital.
good,"Family feel, yet corporate layout.  Very good company to work for and a pleasure.  They have facilities across the US and are one of the best nitrogen products companies in the world."
good,I really enjoy working closely with other departments.  Everyone is eager to work together to ensure the company succeeds.
good,"I was contracted to CF as a Mechanical Consultant working through an agency at the largest project undertaken in the state of Iowa and answered what I could and left questions unanswered that I had no knowledge of., as I was not a direct hire working for CF."
good,"CF is a great company if you can manage to work here. The people are great to work with, the tasks are manageable and the work itself is great if you have experience with what you're doing."
good,Exelente place to work a little to hot in summer but overall was a good experience. Pay was no tto bad art all weekend sometimes. But overall good place for work.
good,"It has the true 'Southern Hospitality' feeling in the office I was a part of.  The pay is enough to live in areas the employee is working in and they treat their contractors like they are full time employees as much as they are able."
good,"This was my first plant job. New to the environment and lifestyle. It was great experience getting to work there, but it was only a temporary job. Eventually moved into pipe fitting, then to load operating and ended in a plant operator position."
good,The objective was clear and the management trusted that we were going to complete the task assigned to us. Management relationship with employees was good.
good,Good company. Largest Ammonia plant in the world. Just recently expanded. Big for the community and area. Employs a ton of people from the area. Viable for the economic growth of the Donaldsonville area.
good,"Was hired as temporary to do various filing for the company.  Then moved to accounts payable to help out with entering invoices and sorting mail.  Job was only going to be temporary, and although I was laid off the first time when all the filing was finished ( catch up on year end) , I was called back to help out again.  Worked here through La. Staffing."
good,Was a very good company had a nice chance to explore about Large  company in detail about how does it work and different types of procedures and safety related issues
good,"Seriously safety oriented company. Not just an act, they do actually care about the safety of their employees. The encourage you to move up and support continueing education. Great place to work!!"
good,"Great company, I would retire from CF industries but I am tired of shift work. If I had normal hours I wouldn't leave. Great benefits and pay is VERY good for what I do."
good,"CF Industries, particularly at Medicine Hat Nitrogen Complex is the best work place I ever had. The people and culture I worked are very nice and professional. I can only wish corporate office had move me back to my home site, than being let go from other site's cancelled or on hold projects."
good,"Resolve trouble tickets, take calls form local and remote users, troubleshoot software applications, troubleshoot printers, image and repair desktops and laptops. I learned about Outlook troubleshooting and browser settings. Management could communicate better with certain departments. Culture was relaxed in my department. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with multiple issues at the same time with people asking you to juggle more. Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to remote sites."
good,Great place to work with good people. Benefits are great. I enjoyed developing applications that actually impacted the productivity of the plant(s). Culture is very supportive.
good,"Work was a slow shift, 12 hr days/nights first few hrs not much is done until maintenance come it with a work order. Great people to work with."
good,Private company so the culture was more personable between upper management and employees. Everyone worked as a team and interacted teamwork between departments.
good,"Great place to work. Friendly and outgoing atmosphere. Unreal benefits for people with family ex: Christmas party, summer party. "
good,"CF Industries has a storied history and is more than 50 years old. Most of that time was as a cooperative as it has only been public since 2005. Most employees have been there more than 10 years and there are more than a dozen (in an office of 250) with tenure greater than 30 years (which says something all by its self). Their flex-time schedule allows you to start your day between 8:30 and 9:30 and end between 4:30 and 5:30, very few stay late. Generally, the attitude is that as long as you get your work done well, you don't have to stay a second past the end of the day, which is excellent. Management is fair, I never hear of someone getting yelled at with raised voices and everyone is nice and cordial to each other. The HR department could be better, but since its such a nice place to work, that's a small complaint. all that said, you need to work really hard to advance within the organization. there's a tendency to hire from the outside, however this is slowly changing. compensation is fair, not great, a typical raise is between 1 and 3 percent annually."
good,Great company morale within departments. Advancement is possible and likely and encouraged. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,CF Industries developed a family type culture.  Company stability was a definite priority.  Employees were encouraged to develop their skill sets and rewarded with increased responsibility and compensation.  The people were friendly and supported one another.  An enjoyable place to work
good,"Gook working environment. Lots of smart people, and mostly good management. It can  be difficult to get things done as it requires a lot of approval and talking to people who are never around/ always in meetings. Overall a great experience though."
good,Great Company and Great Environment! The staff is friendly and management is flexible. I have enjoyed my experience thus far!
good,"Work with maintenance on small projects and with outside engineering firms on projects above 500K. Typical work day includes meeting with management to prioritize work, working with process to help define improvements, and meeting with firms about work and scope definition. Hardest part is realizing there is work that you can not complete. The plant is always in need of improvements. Most enjoyable part is a new challenge every day."
good,"Great Place to Intern. Learned A LOT, very knowledgeable operations staff always willing to teach you about the process and or equipment."
good,I enjoy my time there getting to know my co-workers and learning as much about instrumentation as I possibly can. I typical day consist of being paired with an Instrument technician and observing and assisting the work being done throughout the day.
good,"i learned alot working at cf industries , i was alwasy on my feet working and nevr had time to relax but that was what made the job even funner n the day pass by fast."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Loud , a lot of machines going off at once , very stress free job , just a repetitive career , I learned to manage a small team , strip and wax floors ,   mix floor care chemicals . the hardest part of my job was if we had people call out , because we were under staffed , but the most enjoyable was the people i worked with."
good,"Good people, good salary, good working hour, 60+, good communication, knowlageble people, outanding workers, good safty futures, good care, good per diem,"
good,"A typical day at work consists of placing orders for customers and making sure customer needs are met.  I was given the opportunity to learn about the logistics of rail/truck transportation while collaborating with other departments such as credit, supply chain and sales."
good,awesome place to work the weather was horrible for the fact job was located in Iowa but would defnty recommend the job for anyone will to work had and at a fast pace
good,.I was onsite contractor at CF. I was the HR point of contact from field to corporate office. I was over the Hr functions and helped new hire on boarding as well as assisted safety with any admin needs.
good,I enjoyed my time spent with CF Industries. It was an amazing company to work for. Everyone there was extremely welcoming and friendly with a very talented crew ready to help you with anything you were ready to learn.
good,"Very busy days in timekeeping"
good,"Friendly and helpful staff, great environment, would highly recommend working there! Encouraged educating junior staff."
good,"I installed instruments/gauges, found the most efficient route, measuring and bending tubing, fabricating support, tubing trays and tubing clips. Be aware of my surroundings and the safety of everyone"
good,It was a good experience/knowledge that was shared/taught to me by people I worked with (their is always a lot to learn).
good,CF industries is a horrible company.  I did not enjoy working for them. The work is very slow. i do not want to work for CF again.
good,safety was the number one key while working with CF. It gives you opportunities as well as safety . CF requires that you work efficient and at a normal paste
good,I learned a lot and grew so much working here. This was a large phosphate plant . They produced fertilizer from digging and mining the ground to loading raw fertilizer in railcars and trucks to be shipped around the world. I learned how to work safe too.
good,"A typical day at work and what I learned was how to operate valves and/or instrument to adjust fluid levels, flow, temperature, pressures, speed of equipment, and starting/stopping of mechanical equipment.  Lubricates and properly operate equipment.  Used troubleshooting skills to find and report problems.  "
good,"I've learn more about carpentry itself, from forms to rebar and actually building things. The management is well kept up. The co-worker are like family. The hardest part of the job is to keep from getting injured. The most enjoyable part of the job it to get it done without injuries and leaving safe."
good,My day starts with a safety meeting in the morning with the crew.Followed by passing out any PPE that may be needed. Afterwards I would walk around different job sites observing crews working and also filling out SOS audits due for the day. I usually learn something different everyday about which policy and procedures different companies work by. Crews are usually informative and helpful when asking questions. While on turnaround status the hardest part of my day is working with other companies to figure whose job is priority and setting aside tasks. Management usually gets along with each other so we can the most production done in a day. I can say that I enjoy meeting the new people with different companies and learning the different procedures by which they follow. It helps me to be better at my job when trying to ensure safety is being followed on the jobsite.
good,"Work usually begins at 6 am "
good,Great people to work for and with. Everyone trying to make the internship a positive learning experience. Would love to be employed permently with this Co.
