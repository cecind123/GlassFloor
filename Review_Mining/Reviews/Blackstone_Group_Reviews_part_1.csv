bad,"Just an plain bad co to work for. Long hours, low pay, several bounced paychecks. There os no more to say. They suck and I would not recomend them to ANYONE."
bad,Worked there for 16years an never received a raise.They don't want to pay you what your worth.Suppose to work around your schedule but neva did.Neva had hours always want to send you further than whats expected.
bad,Blackstone was a very unhappy place to work. Blackstone did provide hours as needed but when ask to be remove from a client that may have been a risk to my life I was told I won't have any hours instead of trying to work with me and place me with someone else. The scheduler had an attitude overall Blackstone is just ok.
bad,"The job is easy the workers make it hard. You do not feel like you are wanted. Not enough pay, tips are never fair, and people who do not work get special treatment."
bad,this job was my fist long term job but when i got sick and tried to return they came up with some excuse not for me to return and this was actually to me none of their business why i went into the hospital but when i came out i was better  in other words they were very discriminatory.
bad,I didn't really like this job because i had to work in harsh weather conditions with inadequate equipment. I mentally gag when i think about going back
bad,This place is a nightmare. You are expected to work 12 hour days without leaving the building. They justify this by buying you a $15 lunch that you have to eat at your desk. There is zero training and no support. Everyone is overworked and miserable in the support staff and fearful of loosing their jobs.
bad,"The technology side was awful. Management does not care about your ideas, unless they're really good ideas, but you wont' get rewarded for them or even credited for them. No work/life balance, you're expected to be on call 24/7. No sort of advancement path in place. No respect for employee personal life."
bad,Nothing has change with this company but the location!! They are hiring all these aides with 32 hrs avaiable they have no clients they mess up ur pay ..i have worked for this company twice once i see aint nothing change i did a whole 360 they need to stop lieing to people about hrs !!! They dont have

bad,"â€¢	a typical day at work"
bad,"MDs and SMDs engage workplace harassment with impunity. HR is powerless. During 8 years I saw numberous women and men experience extended periods of harrasment only to be fired. Typically a package is paid to keep this quiet. Almost seems like some bizarre sport. Fortunately I left on great terms however I would never recomment Blackstone to anyone, hopefully as they get bigger more light is shed on this culture."
bad,"Blackstone is a great place to work for, but it is difficult to have consistent clients. I am always needing more hours, however clients always cancel."
bad,A bunch of crazy Scientologists....you better be one if you expect to advance or make money. The worst supervisor ever. Unfair in every way. Run away from there...run far away
bad,"Poorly managed, even for a security company."
bad,Communication between employees and management could improve. Salary is at the low end. A good place to work if a person does not want to work very much.

bad,I really didn't like the job because there was no job securty and they people off al the time.
bad,"Pay was excellent. They over work the young people. I saw many who stayed everyday till midnight. There was no work balance.. They only chose people from top universitys. I worked as a consultant, in which co worker look down upon me and was very rude in training and did not want to show me all aspects of the position"
bad,"I was an intern going into Blackstone and was not treated nice there at all. I was learning a lot and I did meet a lot of important people, but I did not fit into the corporate culture Blackstone had to offer. It was very team oriented and I rarely had any interaction with my manager. I would get a lot of heat from my teammates for little things and felt very uncomfortable. I took my leave in June of 2019."
bad,"Blackstone is an great agency to work for, I love all my clients and it's now going on 2yrs. My only issue with them is that I feel I deserve pto time or an vacation after ALL this time & they said I'm not eligible.. Which I feel is sad after being with them this long.. I started off fulltime & I'm now by choice part-time."

good,"Best part of the job is the friendships and companions you meet there, worst part is easily the favoritism and inconsistent management that comes with opening / closing / throughout the day work."
good,"I was very disappointed in the lack for OSHA safety regulations.  Very unorthodox.  Very hard to communicate with the trades.  Most of the trades are piece workers, so they don't show up everyday.  Management was pleasant to work with and very helpful. They offer an open door policy to everyone."

good,"There's no career advancement if you are not a money maker. They don't offer training, opportunities to learn and acquire new skills, or incentives to move around to different departments. There's no team collaboration and you have to watch your back."
good,"I worked for the retention department of the company, where the object was to try to make our customers happy & convince them to stay with our services whether it was one of our prepaid calling card machines or our merchant service."

good,I really loved working here until I was going through something personal and management  didn't even bother to care what I was going through.

I asked the HR manager if there was anyway possible if I can miss like a week or 2 of work just so I can get myself situated again but said she couldn't grant me that.

Always get to work with new and different people."
good,"There are a lot of very talented and smart people at Blackstone.  The one area where there could be significant improvement is management's ability to recognize, develop, and promote talent from within the organization.
