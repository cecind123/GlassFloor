rating,review
bad,"ADT,"
bad,Overall distrust and lack of loyalty of the company to all employees. Employees are underpaid and overworked.  Little or no chance for advancement unless you pucker up.
bad,"I worked for ADT for 3yrs. Started out great until the changes came in 2017. Stock and company slowly going down so they are cutting corners. Cut people's pay in 2019 and started getting rid of old veterans so they could bring new hires in on a lower pay scale to save money. Turnover rate is ridiculous. Management is not on the same pagels you to do it this way and another says that way, you probably will get written up for no reason but following instructions. If you make a complaint to hr it finds it way back to the floor and you will be fired within the next 3mths more than likely."
bad,"When I started working here it waS great then our office split so we could pick more territory , in my opinion this wAs managed very poorly as the work got slim after the split and the management didn’t take a lot of responsibility to change anything cause they were still getting compensated for just being there"
bad,No respect given if you wish to be degraded treated like dirt and berated daily this is your dream job they will threaten you berate you and create non achievable goals all the while telling you you’re worthless
bad,"I worked for ADT in Jacksonville, FL in Loyalty Account Management, Retention, whatever you wanna call it and ADT is an awful company. Really low pay and the company doesn’t care about employees. I guess it’s a okay temporary job but I wouldn’t recommend it, look harder for a better job/company."
bad,Like the government you dont do exactly what your told you fet the boot no questions asked jeanie should have been gone years ago but I guess she does “favors” for the managers
bad,"Its a company that is going under."
bad,It took me 3  years to relaize that this is not the place for me. It started off good and then a huge down spirl from that point on. I would only recommend ADT if you are just looking for something to carry you over into your next blessing. Not to retire here!!! NOPE!
bad,"The location in Torrance had to be one of the most hostile environments of my entire career. The manager had been placed in the position and had no formal training on managing people. I sat across from a woman who cried almost daily from the humiliation of the manager. When a job was sold it would take twice as long to process since the tec’s had no Parts on the trucks. I did ride alongs and Training before I was able to sell this was in my 90 day probationary period of which the training took 60 daysmandatory tru"
bad,New branch manager has no people skills.  Promises to conduct meetings and follow up with sales results only to deliver nothing. Enjoys intimidating employees.  Commission only position that relies heavily on company driven sales leads but Company fails to deliver.  They do not care about customers or customer issues after they’ve sold them their system.
bad,"The ranking system at ADT is designed for a sales floor mindset. Which is fine for a sales floor, but they treat customers and employees like numbers. You literally have a rank against your peer when it comes to customer service. Its also based off of shifts. So, you could have better numbers than someone in night shift, but because they are in night shift, they can be ranked higher than you."
bad,When I initially started at ADT I was thrilled. Management was great. Employees were valued. Management was awesome. Within the last 4-5 years there has been so many changes within the company employees feel they don’t know what their job descriptions are. There’s no consistency.
bad,"Stay away from this old company that hires managers that are very good at cheerleading - but nothing esle!!"
bad,Snakes in the grass and they try to teach you to be. Don't do it just go find a better job. If you don't drink the cool aid you won't make it. It's a fake environment and full of false positivity. You don't land $1000+ sales every time you are treated poorly and put outside the circle until you sell. No one wants the old tech ADT has either. Horrible ethics and people only looking after themselves.
bad,"I've NEVER worked at a more discombobulated company in my life!  Their training is horrible; management lies to you all the time.  Very aggressive atmosphere...it's like working for a circus or carnival.  They take their sweet time paying you for your ""Paid-time-off"" let alone your regular pay-check."
bad,"The ADT Irving TX location is awful. I was terminated due to a narcissistic unit manager that had it in for me. She only liked reps she thought was beneath her. If she knows your intelligent, and you don’t kiss her butt, she will give you just enough rope to let you hang yourself. And the team managers, i feel bad for them, it’s like the blind leading the blind at ADT Irving location. ADT Irving is very ghetto."
bad,Great if you want to do minimum in your future. Some fun people but managers are clueless. Asking for more than what's told to you in the interview. Very stressful.
bad,"Competing with authorized dealers and ADT's own call center made it difficult to complete sales.  Local management is laughable at best.  If you like working a lot and not seeing your family, then this is the place to go"
bad,Horrible management and dysfunctional or complete lack of organization. No support and sandbagged without management actually knowing my abilities.  Never given a chance to succeed.
bad,"Adt was my first call center job and I did great. The employees have a high standard to keep, yet, are not appreciated. The customers are important and so are the employees that serve the customers. I was a four star agent after only being there a little over 4 months. One bad call in which a habitual calling and complaining customer called in to complain on me and I was given the death penalty. It was a weekend so my supervisor was not there. There was a weekend supervisor that put in to terminate me over the call which could’ve been a teachable moment, if I had done something wrong. Once that supervisor found out who I was due to a mutual friend we have she said how bad she then felt and that I could get her personal info from the friend to use her as a reference being that she had already submitted the termination request.  To know that things would’ve been different had she known my character I was the good agent our mutual friend had been speaking so highly of, things would’ve been different . There are so many managers and not enough"
bad,They lack management skills they want you to be a One-Stop shop so you're doing billing technical service and everything in between they come out with a new product and we don't need to have the opportunity to train on it the first call with getting is our training pay was not good and there is no up training
bad,Just a Really bad unfair experience. Management changes weekly. Firings and hirings constantly.  Really bad work circumstances.  Beware. Things always changing.    Very bad place ti work. Beware
bad,"To be aware of your surroundings, I have learned a lot in the industry over the 12 years, this isn’t a job you take lightly, need to be able to pick up to 20 kgs. Everyone is friendly here, management have a lot to answer for."
bad,"Back to back calls all day where metrics where tailored just to make you take more calls smh. I have never heard of the stat utilization until I worked here. Don't know if they gave u paid time off because the company would never let u apply for the time off, and even worse if u call out the manager would threaten your job if u didn't come in for the day. I heard a adt manager (Lamar) threatened to go-to one of her agents house if they called in sick. They also did not let u use the restroom in there either,.angers and floorwalkers would come into the restroom and make u go back to the floor  "
bad,"The workload was extreme considering it was a commission only position. Minimum 100 phone calls per day, visit 30-50 homes or businesses daily and run appointments"
bad,Traning Manager extremely snobby and shows favoritism. I received a write up just because I didn't meet expectations in Training! They also gave me a time limit to learn all this stuff and basically said if I didn't I would be terminated Just because I didn't learn everything at the pace they wanted me too!Although I tried my best if your not a technical person this job is not for you. Also some of the managers in training can be so rude when asking for help for God's sake do your job that's what your there for!Not speaking for all but some! Horrible experience and embarrassing!
bad,"Nasty inexperienced managers who don’t have any fire and security industry knowledge , They don’t care about customers , just profits ,make a buck at any cost , They don’t value the engineering departments because they don’t have any idea what they do. The turn over of staff is high but they just don’t get it."
bad,"Not happy with work this people "
bad,"No Productivity"
bad,"Never make a mistake, even if they can’t verify it, because they will fire you immediately without verbal or written warning. No matter how long you have been there or wether you have ever done anything before or not. They will not believe you. They will side against you. Don’t count on your supervisor to back you up either. They’re scared of management. Be warned."
bad,"it was a call center with various shifts/schedules. they were open on weekends also. i worked a mid day shift, which we were told in training they  would have shift bids, and we would be able to change. but that never happen."
bad,"You have to work 24/7 to make any real money. God forbid you take a day off and risk not getting a payout at all or less than $100. They don’t give raises. $11. An hour is it. "
bad,"Very nice company with many years experience, However very bad management and I was actually fired based on Race and skin color. "
bad,"I worked for ADT for over 15 years and when I started, it was a fun place to work and the staff were treated with respect. "
bad,"cliquey colleagues who talk about you as soon as your back is turned. 12 long hours answering faults more than genuine alarms. Having to wake people in the dead of night to tell them there is a fault with the internet but you can only tell them if they remember their password, if not you have woken them for no reason and will now go on to wake 1 of their key holders. Worst job I've ever had and cannot wait to get a new job."
bad,Adt has Poor management. The management does have favoritism towards certain employees. Advance is by whether they like you and not by your skills or numbers. Very poorly managed company.
bad,"Lack of correct training for sales and techs culture has become increasingly all about numbers."
bad,"Very uncomfortable workplace, nice at first hire last about 1-2 weeks and then the atmosphere of all managers, office workers very cold very unbelievable hostile workplace. Very large turn over with employees.  Their culture at this company is  what manager can be the most condescending to all others.  Very hostile and never appreciated no matter how hard you work.  Sad!  Beware!!!"
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone.  The management is dysfunctional and the workplace culture is terrible.  There is no part of this employment that I enjoyed.
bad,i'm not commenting until i speak with the CEO. I am now seeking mental health because this job was so toxic it put me in a depression.  I'm no longer the person i was before.
bad,"Avoid ADT at all costs, terrible place to work. Promised training you'll never get and phone sales are encouraged to take sales in process or being finalized."
bad,"Retention vs. “Account Management”"
bad,"They start of being positive and supportive and after a while when  you are not of the small 1% geniuses that move up to higher positions you are eventually fired or quit from the stress and pressure Some of them will make false claims in your employee record. There are a lot of employees who are cheating the system to keep their job and its very stressful if you have integrity and are not  a snitch. I was dismissed because i had been in the hospital for major health issues and they said i missed to many hours and i had paperwork from the hospital to show i was hospitalized. 80 hours max allowed. Another hard part of this job is if  a customer is cussing and screaming you get lower points on that call. f you are able to hack this place like very few are able to my hats off to you. i am glad to not work for those backstabbers anymore. Bait and switch.  The culture is diverse, suzy homemaker, alternative, lgbt. The only thing i ever enjoyed was the fun days when they would have pajama day and the like, they stopped doing it suddenly and moral went down. i heard since they let me go its just gotten worse and  ppl are quitting or getting fired left and right and a new heard of people are hired in. Its like  a revolving door . The health insurance isnt anything to miss either. my office visits were never covered. just most of the medications were. also watch out when you have a review, they want you to sign it on the computer and not read everything they write"
bad,"excessive hours and traveling, micromanagement, install teams that do not want to do the work assigned causing loss of sales, incompetence, laziness, frustration, and horrendous mismanagement."
bad,"Not a place Id like to go back to work.  Its a place where the boss is always right regardless of circumstances.  They don't promote from within, they always higher from outside the company."
bad,Managers are lazy and dont know how system works. Often they benefit from an unfair matrix that's why they become managers. There are ppl who work for many years and work hard everyday and they bring someone from outside with no experience to be their manager. Very unfair place. You have to be a fav of a manager to get promoted but really there is no room for advancement.
bad,"This job was a in field door to door sales job commission only.  It wasn't for me.  Some days you don't sell, and if you don't sell you don't eat.  Be prepared to put a lot of miles on your car riding in your assigned territory."
bad,As long as they keep the managers at Lexington KY that office will shut down. People quit without notice because of the old ways. This company has great potential but not a fair place.
bad,"Went into security work because of previous employment.  Manager that hired me was fired before training due to personal issues with other management.  New manager micromanaged and had demanding expectations.  To be fair, he would travel to a job site to help with designing a system but was a little two faced in the office environment.  Hours and goals were higher than the product was worth, installers were lazy and cost company too much money and sales was being blamed, union ruins techs by allowing them to be lazy and unproductive.  Some techs were good and got things done without issue but they were prioritized for special sales personnel."
bad,Don't go there. It is a modern-day sweatshop that will suck the life out of you. Products are ok but the competition comes from multiple internal and external fronts.
bad,"The old ADT was an OK company to work for but since they break away from Tyco it been going downhill ever since. Protection one security purchased them, but they keep the same business model, now Protection one also struggle"
bad,"Poor work enviroment, stressful job  no room for advancement. Turnaround rate is horrible, my dedication to the company means nothing to them. Tired of working for a company and being just another number"
bad,"ADT has changed for the worst since it separated from Tyco and gotten even more worse under Apollo Global Management. ADT is more concerned about making money than caring about their employees. Atmosphere has become very ""zero tolerance"" from management when it comes to making mistakes. One mistake (even if they can't prove it) and you're gone, regardless of how long you have been there. Being a loyal (working there 10+ years) employee makes no difference in their decision making if you make even one mistake. Be warned."
bad,Terrible Management. Want you to work for free. Not enough training. Payong attention to other things instead of sales. Treat you like a little kid. Don't allow you to your work. Too many hours not being productive. Too much drama at work place.......
bad,"Beware of this place from the very beginning there were problems."
bad,I hated my life when I worked here. Management is not there to manage but to keep their jobs safe. Culture is terrible. Hardest part of my day was getting the strength to come into work
bad,"ADT where dreams go to die.  Back to back calls - work actions in between calls?    They care about their employees? - The fire alarm did not work for over a year in Irving.  Employee recognition - Hope you like balloons and stickers.  Skill sets required; submissive, compliant and rear kissing.  The culture for employees is the walking dead, for management it is power corrupts all.   I know you need a job but do not sacrifice your dignity."
bad,"Very controlled no time to do anything all calls reviewed and any error strictly criticized  No breaks they encourage you to keep a urinal by your station and all you have to do are raise your hand, and someone will empty it for you. If you gotta take a dump wait till lunch or dinner.  they do have bedpans for number 2 and for the ladies but no privacy"
bad,7.5 hours of listening to customer complaints. Very negative experience. Low pay and lots of responsibilities. Training is inadequate. Company has a high turnover rate. Customers are not satisfied. Employee morale is at an all time low and it shows. You can feel the toxic environment the second.you walk into the building. Stress level is through the roof
bad,as protection one in ADT merged employees at protection one we're told that the merged company would follow protection one policies that however did not come to fruition at all and as a matter of fact they changed the employee alarm system benefit wear as a protection one employee when we left the company we were given an option to keep the alarm system under contract or to cancel the service and not worry about the contract and or early termination fees I left ATT and August of 2017 and I am still fighting them to let me out of my contract with them as I no longer work there and I don't want their product.  there became an an an air of nervousness among employees the they didn't want to offer training to get us on quote unquote the ADT procedure it just it became very unprofessional and very stressful
bad,If you don't have a life work for ADT.  Training is poor.  It lasts two weeks and then you are thrown into the field without support.  Paper is extensive and you have to do it on your phone.  You are required to work ungodly hours.  They scheduled back to back jobs with a 2 hour install window.   These installs take longer than two hours.  In addition you are required to upsell.  They say you can make 100k.  That's if you don't die from exhaustion first. In addition having a manager that manages by insulting you doest help. Jobs are often scheduled 1.5 hours away from your home.  And if you have two installs in one day they could be 50 miles from each other.   ADT makes money by having Sales and Install Techs work for FREE.  If you average the hours you work and the pay you get its $5.00 an hour.  In addition you will drive your car into the ground.  This is the new American Company.
bad,ADT is one of the top ten worse companies to work for. The believe they can treat their employees the same way they treat their customers anyway they want to and that they will stay with them.
bad,"The morale at this place is so beyond ridiculous I cant even take it. I was there for a long while and watched this company go straight into the trash when the merger happened. Its all about cutting costs, cutting jobs, cutting raises, all to benefit the person sitting on top. No advancement! at all! Management sits around and does nothing to support their teams."
bad,Run. Don't even fill out the app.you wanna be treated like a number. wanna be treated like robot . less than human that gets scolded for bathroom breaks . work here
bad,I can't really provide any current information about the company. It has been quite a few years since I have been employed there. There was not any room for advancement. I would recommended to find a different employer.
bad,the company has vending machines that you are able to use if you can afford the prices of the items that on display they are great healthy selections that you can choose from.
bad,"Bad management, bad decisions, expensive products, they treat their employees very badly. I do not recommend working here at all. Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,This company has poor management with miscommunication all across the board. I worked there almost 2 yrs and with 2 different centers within. Not worth the trauma I endured.
bad,"The company base pay sucks, same people (favorites) month after month on top if the commissin rankings. Dress code so laxed borderline come to work in my pajamas, dont care how appearances are so  unprofessional. "
bad,constantly fighting losing their customer base from lack of customer service and poorly trained technicians make it hard to find new customers and on top of that the need for revenue is so high anyone who doesn't know will be taken advantage of and deliberately mis-communicated to for the purpose of yeilding high profits for little work provided and cheap electronics to do the job.
bad,"Busy days are Monday's, overall the culture and environment I just didn't like. It was a job and I needed to pay bills however outside of that I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"I obtained this job because I was laid off permanently from my present job due to a plant closing. I thought this was a good place to work, but found out management cared less about your being or personal welfare. The pay was bad, no benefits, no set hours to work, they changed daily so rest was a major problem."
bad,"Pushy, unreasonable management. Management got commission from other employee sales. No room for advancement. Rude branch owner who had no people skills. This led to the demise of the office."
bad,"Poor management, they hire anybody under the sun. Pay is low. Location is in the middle of no where. Product is horrible. Training was useless. And a lot of management lie on employees."
bad,Absolutely terrible experience from the beginning to the end.  I will never work for them again for as long as I live.  Nobody should ever work for this co.
bad,"its a call center, if you have a pulse it sucks. you'll never make bouns, the managers are jerks and your never e happy there. this jo was the worst, but it paid well for the time."
bad,ADT was only interested in you signing up your friends and family and then they dried you up after 6 months. The mangers were no help when you need them and they generally had a poor attitude.
bad,"this is the worst job i have had in my career. Horrible leadership with no direction. all goals and needs were based on meeting manager goals, not a benefit to the company"
bad,"Run, zero communication, blame passed to everyone but the person responsible. Bad, just show up and stay under radar and you'll be gold. Every man for themselves."
bad,"I was called for a face to face interview for 3x, all went well and said that they would get back to me except that they never did! after calling and leaving them text message i heard nothing. absolute time waster. very unprofessional management hence poor rating."
bad,Leaving ADT was the best decision I ever made. I worked there a year and a half and nothing I did was enough. There were always changes that made no sense and things put in place to set you up for failure. ADT cares nothing about their employees.
bad,"The management in San Diego is not good. You may have better luck in other areas of the US. Overall the company is great and offers a great service, BUT can leave their customers in the wind."
bad,This is the worst place i have ever worked for. This company is so unorganized and unprofessional. They do not care about their employees and do not take care of them. I would definitely NOT recommend working for this company
bad,Dreadful culture/no culture.  Disconnect between management and remote offices. On call 7 days a week. Endless micromanagement. Unrealistic expectations. Compensation changes often and never in employees favor.
bad,"work environment is poor, no support, wages are poor, very high turn over rate. waste of time burning gas drive all over the state for absolutely nothing at all"
bad,"This company is terrible, managers don't care about employees, there is no advancement, really low wages, you get good shifts as you go and basically sit on your ass and do nothing, really disorganized"
bad,The design team is responsible to support the entire organization therefore there is a lot of opportunity to design different products and services and impact the UX.
bad,"Satisfaction from clients after your visit.  working with team members,    enjoying trips with wife on the Co to the finest HOtels  Sorry job closed at short notice"
bad,"dont get paid enough , i found out that someone gets paid more than me and we  do the exact same thing , management sucks, work enviorment id sull and boring no windows in my building"
bad,no good pay commission sucks. job changed for the worse..bad place to work.. dont care about employees only the best for the company...selfish stingy and use to making money until new vice president got in and walks around all day like he high off coke.. never involve with employees. selfish company
bad,"As a security patrol officer, ADT, kept increasing our beats, yet minimizing our equipment, poor radio quality, vehicles not suited for 24/7 patrol,missing charger for Nextel, forms not supplied by managers, poor upkeep on vehicles, dispatch poorly trained, management have no concern for patrol officers safety, only company liability,often no breaks or lunch breaks."
bad,The business midel here is to give $750 in salary total in an attempt to get you to sign up family and friends. You will be sent to the same address over and over many will be vacant you can not make a living doing this unless your spouse supports you and you are after pocket change
bad,They claim to need you to save lives but they could care less if anything were to happen in your personal life. Most jobs teach and coach not them either you learn or get fired
bad,"Typical call center environment. EXTREMELY high attrition rate; right before leaving in 2016 it was well over 50%. The managers are not promoted based on actual qualifications, but based on popularity, and until recently, no women were promoted within the advanced technical support department (and that's only because the supervisor was replaced)."
bad,"- A typical day you can  a lot of phone calls"
bad,"Adt is far behind the curve in terms of just about everything. They have no structure, upper management is very disconnected from the sales reps, and they change what they want you to do on the fly. I worked at ADT almost 2 years and was placed on 4 different pay plans with each one got worse, also each plan had a totally different way to max pay each requiring you to completely over haul your daily approach."
bad,"ADT started out as a good company to work for. Over the years, it has become a very unprofessional and unfair work environment. I assume because they no longer care who they hire. Management shows favoritism. I've NEVER been in a company that shows so much favoritism as ADT. Managers talk to you rudely and with little respect. No one there seems to be really concerned and management is so unprofessional, you could pass them in the hallway and they look down to avoid speaking.  A lot of times when you need assistance with something, they act as if you are getting on their nerves when it's their job to assist. The health insurance is not good. This would be a great company again if they got a new leadership team."
bad,This company makes you work 12-14 hours a day and you only get paid by commission. You could be sweating to death in hot weather and they drop you off in a neighborhood and forget about you
bad,"Leadership was a joke and failed to live up to promises made at employment. "
bad,"Worst company I have worked for in many years. The people were ok but the customer base was very unforgiving and quite rude most of the time. Managers were there to help themselves get a big bonus but it was on ""opportunity"" to work weekends..."
bad,"The coordinators all talk about each other and try to get everyone fired. The managers don’t do anything about it, the OKC Office is ran terribly. One coordinator is the managers favorite so they do no wrong and get zero discipline."
bad,Look at this as a temp job until you find something else.. high pressure sales to consumers and small business.. I would look at this profession as a last resort
bad,They work you like dogs. Schedule is awful if you have kids or a family. No two days off in a row. must not be out of your seat more than 2% of your work day.
bad,"My advice to anyone who think joining this company to think twice , not for nothing but just it’s a waste of time if you are looking for a stable job . They recruit at first then after the first probation period they will call you and say your performance is not at the expectation of the company goals , so if you are lucky they will say we are going to extend your probation for three month more and by that time they will call you again and say we are sorry your contract is terminated you did not meet the expectation we thought you will do. The people in their are not really bad their is some nice persons but still always their is some bad apples. To be brief it’s an unhealthy place and enviroment and you will see a lot of people come in and go every month dozens of them never stay and those who get in their and work hard they get lay off after a certain period of time easily ."
bad,It was a good company when I first started they used to care about employees but that has gotten lost in all the changes they have made over the years
bad,"THis is a call center job and a very bad one.  THere is always so much gossip and immaturity , they watch you all the time and can barley take breakss"
bad,"Working for adt  in phoenix was a great experience. Got pay well"
bad,Management was paid on stick count versus the rep who was paid on dollars sold. Had management sneaking around selling accounts for basically free. Was a stop gap. No way to make any real money when youre selling pennies.
bad,"Alarm installations are troublesome . The systems they use at ADT weren't state of the art, therefore it had a lot of faults. The management required upselling of equipment where none was needed."
bad,Way too much labor not enough pay. Crawling through attics in the desert in the summer. Be ready yo handle 130 plus degrees and when you're not in attics you're outside in the heat installing cameras.
bad,The environment is less than business casusual little to  non dress code enforcement not consistent. Lack of qualified managers and team leaders. Unrealistic expectations for those that are employeed. No reqards for single parent and childcare issues.
bad,"Schlechte Bezahlung "
bad,"Numbers driven"
bad,"Lack of leadership, to many pay changes, benefits garbage, training is terrible, not competitive, They want you to drive 80 to 100 miles for 10cents a mile"
bad,I would never work for this company again.  Going door to door in 100+ degree weather is unhealthy and is an outdated method of business.  micro management at its best.  Leads are cut off if you are not closing any deals.  You are forced to close at least 4 self gens monthly in order to keep your job or even acquire leads from company.
bad,mangers are always complain that they work never gets done and we have to many go backs on tickets but what they dont tell you is that you have 7 to 8 calls aday to catch and if you have to work over thats okay with them.Until Friday comes around and they send you home to knock you out of your over time.There is no place to move up in the company unless you no somebody
bad,This is the worst place i have ever worked for this is pitiful they have absolutely no concern for employees people who continue to stay with them i feel sorry for they have no idea what the world could offer
bad,"working for this ""company"" was a big mistake and horrible experience. Nothing was accurate or consistent. Pay was horrendous! I would never recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Calls are horrible, very rude customers. Managers are no help. Assist line sucks. Managers complain about everything you do. They have issues with bugs."
bad,worst place i ever worked in my life. Micromanaging. no salary. everything is complete commission. manager treats employees like garbage. i would recommend this company to anyone unless i hated them.
bad,I started  with  Idt  only  been  paid  commission. I really  enjoyed  working  with  the  clients and  marketing  the  product  of ADT  alarm  system's  and  their services.
bad,Since the merger ADT cares nothing about maintaining the Protection one processes Tim Whall needs to take notice. Why do you think Tyco separated from these leaches in Charlotte NC.
bad,Every since the company was taken over by Protection One  the fun and morale went out the window. It's a  haven for stress and inconsistency and I could never recommend anyone to work there
bad,this is the most dysfunctional management and company to work for. during my 8 years we had gone through over 100 other sales people in the small business division alone. absolutely the worst company in the country to work for.
bad,loud obnoxious joke talk to people like animals and don't care about you making money. This company is for fools to work while spending your own money to survive.
bad,"i was bullied by my supervisor because i did better than her, when i told HR about it they promptly fired me the next day. i also spoke to another sup for help and was told if it came down to it he would side with my sup because he is a sup and i dont matter."
bad,This was an outbound sales position.               Sales experience is preferred however not required.                The environment was comfortable.
bad,"This place was worse than any HIGH school any place I've worked before.  You have to work 3 times to get paid what you worked for, management lies and if you aren't willing to do drugs sell drugs or sleep with management you'll be bullied harassed and fired."
bad,There has always been insecurity of our jobs since fidelity takes over ADT.  The management give more provision to fidelity employees than ADT employees. There are too many changes at same time without proper replacement or given enough time to adapt to change.
bad,mangers were young and unprofessional.  Very long days with little compensation.  Too many times my paycheck was not correct and payment was pushed to the next pay.
bad,workplace was not enjoyable at all. I rather not comment about this company period. It did not feel like they cared for you or the customer at all. No time taking out to hear people out.
bad,this company is going away from sales reps and going to phone sales and dealers. I don't believe anyone who does not have contacts should not get in it
bad,"if an alarm went off we would contact the customer to verify if they needed fire,medical, or police, then we would contact them and stay on the phone til the services showed up.."
bad,"Manager has a good old boys mentality and was admittedly hired and promoted by a friend. nepotism rules here. If you don't like loud music, ping pong or sports you are an outsider. no communication or training to speak of. Arrogant management. sexist to the hilt. just bad behavior. Encouraged to lie and mislead customers. Little support and demoralizing."
bad,"Company never fired the small business mgr but instead told him to stay away from me.  He used foul, sexually-suggestive language to me when accusing me of obtaining an account that should've been  his. The company terminated me 2 months after I reported this horrible experience.  Just a horrible, horrible experience that still haunts me."
bad,also very high risk and boring. I never grew in this company. very stress full. also underpaid and. working times was very odd. and no family life and you work shifts which messes up your routine.
bad,"I live in oklahoma city. When i first started working here I was promised I would make good money. Told sky was the limit on getting customers. That six figures was easy... well problem is rates are too high, seriously people are not willing to spend 55 dollars for a security system, its easy easier to sell internet at that rate. I had such a difficult time finding customers, they gave me the worst leads ever. even by following their sales process word to word, I even lost customers to ADT authorized dealers all the time who charged much lower rates. .. I did see other agents make good money yet I suspect they were lying to their customers. Training was fun in Denver at least. I knew agents from other cities like Austin, and even Seattle who had a much easier time making money as they have access to people with more disposable income."
bad,Don't do it its a scam. Commission only jobs that's door to door always are. Someone even threaten to call cops if I didn't leave area. Also dogs run loose their.
bad,This company is in a transition and should not be hiring new sales people until they know which direction they are going. In house sales training was not organized or structured
bad,Buen ambiente laboral el salario y las comisiones eran muy escasas
bad,They have become too large of a company to care about anyone that works for them. Everyone has their own set of rules that they invent. Customers are treated ok but employees are treated horrible.
bad,Was more concerned with making money than providing a quality product.  Laid off senior employees to widen profit margin.  No job security.  Benefits were horrible.
bad,Very workable shirts and they help you pay for school.  Very high call volume and striped so you may great bored easy. Its just a little work factory you don't even get the some desk everyday
bad,"Company does not care about their sales force. constant direction change , High turnover, low pay, no growth, morale is low. management unskilled. not a place to learn or grow"
bad,Catch and release program get your friends and your family to buy a system  then  turn you over. Like going to Barbershop next. Leadership motivates through negatives.
bad,This company had the worse manager I have ever encountered and could not believe they would even hire this person. They did however quickly get rid of.
bad,no real room for growth people get hired then leave within months then adt hires from outside instead of inside so your stuck seeing new employees that got a position you applied for from within
bad,"Everybody needs to start somewherr to get somewhere,joining them was a good step to take. Its very transparent company that takes care of its employees but being a security was very risky job I ever did."
bad,"100% commission and no training, poor management.they start you with a small salary plus commission. clearly not enough money. manager was never in town except for the interview."
bad,Minimum wage phone sales sell custom home security instead sending leads to the custom home team.  Now the team is just sent out for add-on's.  The pay has been changed as-well
bad,"Sale team would send you out to do installs and had never been to the job and sometimes you could not even install the systems because their would be solid wood walls or the customer had no electric outlets available to power up the system. And then they would tell you to tell the customer you can install a wireless unit, but that is against the law and is called BAIT and SWITCH. And when you would return to the office you would be reprimanded because you didn't install the unit."
bad,This is stressful environment.  Production is very high and the turn over rate is also high.  Call center environment for those who like this type of work.
bad,"ADT compensation package is very very bad. It's competitors have a better one. ADT sales micromanagement style is counterproductive at best. ADT managed to hire highly incompetent area sales managers that are supposed to lead region's sales efforts without proper product knowledge."
bad,"If you're looking for a great opportunity, great pay look elsewhere. Any other job in world is better then working here.!"
bad,"the management sucked. They barely trained you .It was an horrible experience  and a waste of time .  Overall , i just feel they need to do better and have a better way of doing their job ."
bad,"Amazing experience"
bad,The work is fast paste and you dont get the opportunity to appreciate the things you do for the customers without it being frowned upon by management of course there is plenty of repeated calls that should be one call resolutions but because of the way customers are handled they hang up and call back because the previous rep did not take the time with them. When you walk in the door in the morning you want to walk right back out.
bad,"I was brought on to facilitate lead flow with ancillary procspecting.  After working with the company for a few months, the lead flow was taken away without notice and I had to change my role within the company."
bad,Constant policy changes 30days to adhere dock you for mistakes change policy again. No one knows an answer. Poor customer and employee service. Have to call multiple departments for simply answers
bad,No one likes working for ADT. The positive ratings are lies. The company lies about everything and will stress you completely out. Nothing you do is ever good enough and the customers hate having to call in because they know how greedy this company really is. Good luck if you start working here. I've contemplated suicide at the thought of this being my career but thank God I came to my senses and decided to go back to school for my CPA. You've been warned..
bad,The job is bad no paid per hour paid per installation piece dont like this job no recoment working from this company that's the same from directv
bad,"Job is great and challenging but the management is poor."
bad,"Management is awful.   After your ramp is over, you will not generate enough to pay your bills in Honolulu.  Too much micro managing."
bad,low wage low structure unprofessional. highly dissatisfied with experience. money was being stolen from my commision adn nothing was done about it inside adt. i had to use the dept of labor to get my funds back.
bad,"bad management, don't care about employees or customers, only profit. very negative environment. over 100% turn over in sales reps. under appreciated at every turn."
bad,"They make lots of promises, but keep none. Management is the worst I have seen in 30 years of working. The compensation structure breaks federal law, but don't tell them, they will fire you. Unethical selling methods are practiced daily. They play favorites with who gets daily leads, and allow multiple reps into your already tiny territory. STAY AS FAR AWAY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE!"
bad,"There is no appreciation on retaining the exceptional talented work force who deliver directly to organization top line and bottom line. "
bad,Training is poor due to changes constantly made and little warning or training. You are tied to your chair and cannot talk while you work. Logging in out of a phone to keep up when and how many times you leave your desk.
bad,large corporation. a huge money machine with little care for workers. compensation plan is not worth the head aches associated with the business
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone!  My co-workers were great but management and the whole environment was toxic. They promise one thing and deliver something else, before accepting a position with them I would do your research."
bad,"Worked there for week. Was laid off, they promised to send my cheque but never did."
bad,Not family oriented. The company didn't appreciate its workers in my eyes. The ones that were there to work were penalized.
bad,"there is no communication between installation, sales, and permits.  The permit woman doesn't do her job, installs cant go in, people get mad and cancel the contract.  WORST JOB EVER"
bad,I worked here because it was close to my house and convenient for me on a daily basis. Thats about it. No comment. I can not remember much about this job.
bad,The job was required to handle hazardous materials all day on a daily basis which on most cases was not done properly.  Was able to learn a lot about the car industry.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, no help on appointment, completely self generated and you have to deal with some very interesting characters. No training or product knowledge given to you and no support from management."
bad,"all was based on commission you could be there for months and you will still not make any money, they lie and tell you you can make money but in reality your wasting your time for nothing."
bad,"I interviewed with this company for nearly 12 weeks...and was ultimately offered a job at their corporate office which I turned down."
bad,A company that boasts how much money you can potentially bring home.  What they don't tell you is how your call routing can impact this.
bad,I didn't like the work environment and everything was unorganized. I will recommend to work there. I am looking forward to starting my career.
bad,the management is the worst. they constantly have employees doing complaints on them. hen u need help or a manger cal they push back. i would only recommend this job for someone fresh out of high school or someone whom is attending college
bad,Very difficult company to work for as a sales rep.  Straight commission with no salary.  Commissions are paid upon job completion which can sometimes take several weeks.  The bonus that a sales rep would receive for monthly production was also changed to jobs that were closed out during the month vs. what was actually sold during the month.  This resulted in the loss of monthly bonus for a lot of reps and took their bonus out of their control and put it solely on the installation department and their ability to quickly get all installations done in a timely manner.  The auto allowance was also changed and resulted in a pay cut for many reps including myself.  Regular commission adjustments were also required with my position and it often took weeks for me to get paid my adjustments.  To say that ADT makes it difficult to earn a living would be a huge understatement.  I worked for the company for many years until recently and it is not even close to being the same company that I started with.  They are also experiencing mass defections in my district with sales reps and managers alike.  More than 8 managers have either quit or been let go in the last 2 years.  They are also experiencing lots of customer service issues/billing issues.  I would not recommend to anyone at this point to work for ADT in a sales capacity.
bad,"Where do I begin, there is so much to dislike about working for this company..Let's start with the office conditions. There were not enough computers for all of the employees when all of the employees were in the office at the same time (call nights). Every computer station did not have a WORKING PHONE next to It.? I had to scavenge around the office to find a working phone to set up next to my computer. I had to settle for a phone that had a short in it. When I was on this particular phone and it started to go out I had to tap the receiver to make it work. This happened right in front of the manger on call night. He did nothing (Willie Wynn) about getting new phones. The network is so slooow in the office it makes doing anything on the computer in the office such a chore because it takes five minutes just to log in! I told the manager that IT needs to increase the bandwidth on the network. He stated that IT was aware of the situation, but nothing ever gets resolved.  I wondered why I was not receiving any telmar leads for about two weeks. I got an email one day from my manager (Willie Wynn) and it stated that I was just put back into telmar. Why was I out of telmar for two weeks? When I was in telmar and going on appointments they were faulty appointments, meaning the name I was given for the appointment did not match the resident in the address I went to. This happened about six times. My manager (Willie Wynn) forgot to submit my expense reports for my cell phone bill numerous times. I had to remind him every time to do it. Maybe because he was managing two sales teams at"
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Many unfulfilled promises and deceitful teaching to make sales.  No ability to make an income.  Led our group in sales, yet never paid commissions due to jobs being rescheduled, and cancelled due to poor service, outside of my control.  Paid 10 cents per mile for travel, which doesn't cover even tires for my vehicle.  I have actually lost money working for this company."
bad,I wish I would have looked first...... I think they are 6 or 7. The products and service are great.... but the company doesn't take care of their employees. I have watched great sales people leave because they couldn't afford to work there due to the poor pay. In the sales department there is 100 % turnover in a year.
bad,"They hook you with a proposed position and hourly wage between $11-$12, the training is hands on and somewhat beneficial if you have a photogenic memory. I realized that I learned more after training that during training, which was kind of frustrating. Overall this company lacked integrity, honesty, and compassion for its customers."
bad,"ADT has very bad management. lame implementation of modern business methods - ie, LEAN and 6-Sigma are merely window-dressing in this company at the branch level. "
bad,"typical work day is first shift 8 to 430. The management is very distant from the co workers, the job in itself is easy yet redundant, there is not really an enjoyable part of this job or position"
bad,"training is horrible and rushed into workload, unable to receive any guidance from management. the workload and pay from this company do not equal out. very low paying. will hire from outside instead of hiring from within. not a place to have a career"
bad,"ADT was deceitful from beginning to end. When I was contacted I was interviewed for a customer service position.  I specifically asked was this a call center position because I wasn't interested in sales. I was assured it was customer service no sales involved. "
bad,"Had to travel entire state running leads from corporate. You can drive 200 miles per day. The leads they have you run are responding to the  cheapest system they sell, which most people don't want. If you actually do sell an ADT system, you get charged back your commission if the customer stops paying for service anytime during the first year. So, if they get ticked off because of a service issue and stop paying, they take the money back from you even though you had absolutely nothing to do with it. You are required to come in once a week and telemarket from a new movers list and you are not paid for this. If you set an appointment, (all companies are using the same list), you get to run it. This keeps ADT from having to spend money providing you leads. You also are expected to set your own self generated appointments too. You pay for your own gas, car repair, cell phone."
bad,Do yourself a favor DONT DO IT. this company does not allow Vetrans to take off for Memorial day  or Veterans day. If you have a family member that passes away  dont plan on attending  the services.They set rules even the managers dont follow.. They allow drug transactions. ... Just think this company has your credit card numbers
bad,awful experience.  HR department is a joke.  trainers are awful don't control their classes.  turnover rate is so high because of these factors.  do yourself Favor and look elsewhere.
bad,"Pay is below average, benefits are okay/ standard"
bad,"The management is never available to help. If you ask to many questions they look down on you. They want you to follow policy to the letter and then turn around and say everything is not black and white. "
bad,Avoid at all cost. Everything about this company is terrible.
bad,"I applied for what was posted as a CSR position with ADT. I received a call from the Ashland Virginia office to interview. I specifically asked was this a call center position not involving sales, because I had no interest in sales. I was assured it wasn't by the manager."
bad,working as a telemarketer for ADT was fun to learn experience and new techniques but when it comes to being professional i give this company a 1 . Ran by a male who only selected females to work for him me and my brother applied both didnt have telemarketing experince but he called me back for a interview and not him wierd right
bad,"Answered the inbound and outbound phone calls to technicians at business sites."
bad,"the worst I've ever been treated by an employer "
bad,"Pay is sub-par at best.  Management only cares about their own pockets by way of bonus money, which means customers have to wait 1, 2 or even more weeks for service.  Used to be 2 1/2 day back log, now it's whenever we get there and you'll like it because we're ADT and were NUMBER 1"
bad,"work with customers and armed response,day to day fleet maitenance"
bad,"It's funny because I read these reviews before I got hired here.....I should have listened....I just seen a review on here that I know is a supervisor or someone in a high position. It a was fake review which made me write this...... Adt does not care about their customers so they sure as heck don't care about their employees! Everyday is stressful and my job isn't even hard but they make it hard. They act like they pay us good, like we should grateful! ! They don't give raises and they don't let you advance.... So you're working like a slave to keep your job. I promise you I could go on and on about how bad adt is but I'll just say this.... If you have to work here then do what you have to do but don't come here thinking it is going to be a place to stay! Adt is the worst company for customers and employees!  #6 On the list of worst places to work for, look it up."
bad,"*The typical day consists of constant threats regarding every word said on calls in Rochester's call center in NY. This bombardment of micromanagement causes a robotic effect in customer service agents who fear the Quality Assurance evaluators more than the customers' reactions. Literally, every phrase and sentence spoken is evaluated with a harsh evaluation. "
bad,"A day at ADT home security consisted of, selling security systems via phone with horrible leads, management was horrible. the hardest part of this job was remaining motivated and encouraged."
bad,"This company is little more than a scam. The interview is nothing but lies. I was told that the sales would be by appointment only - it's knocking on doors in bad neighborhoods that the police escort you out of due to the risk being classed as too great. You're told you're guaranteed $600 a week? You're solely commission working super long hours. If you don't sell, you don't eat. Oh, and when you do sell? That $500 your boss tells you your check will be? Try $108. And that boss? When you try to file a complaint against him? He doesn't exist on corporate record until you speak with an HR manager. This place is a laugh. The training manager himself informed us that they are INSTRUCTED BY ADT to LIE to prospective employees. Because otherwise? ""No one will give us a chance."" I wonder why? Also that B score that they supposedly have with the BBB? Might wanna check that again."
bad,great pay . not very flex hoursm but over all a very goo company
bad,"No aprendí mucho ya que estuve poco tiempo. El trabajo era en negro y lo necesitaba en su momento hasta que entre en ""tym""."
bad,NO BASE PAY AT ALL! ONLY COMMISSION THAT YOU NEVER SEE! waste of time
bad,"First, the on boarding process is beyond frustrating. The training is lackluster and your salary is comparable to that of a fast food worker."
bad,Company needs to change its overall sales structure from a terrible 100%  commission pay to a formal  base pay and high commission pay.
bad,"Management is reactive, not proactive. They threaten to write you up when they drop the ball. "
bad,Terrible company fire you without cause even when you are the best at your job they take advantage  of AtWill Law.
bad,"Horrible company to work for, pathetic ineffectual management, bait and switch tactics in hiring, dishonest behavior for management starting at the top"
bad,"teléfonos sonando a cada rato que te rompe la cabeza y te queres ir, como comenzar una venta y como finalizarla, mis colegas no llegue a conocerlos ya que no estuve mucho tiempo trabajando en atd, la parte mas dificil del trabajo era finalizar una venta, lo que mas me gusto fue que me aprendi a desallorarme mas rapido en el tema de ventas "
bad,this was the worst job ever. i would not recomend it to anyone. 
bad,The job was extremely stressful. Not really any support from management who were themselves stressed over the stress of their employees.
bad,"With ADT being a big company, I came in with high expectations."
bad,First and last door to door sales job i had it was great if you can sell if not dont bother with it
bad,The company has a high turnover rate due to:
bad,This company had no values what so ever. A learning experience that I will never forget.
bad,Its very un-organized. Management could definitely do better.
bad,very un-organized. and the training could definitely use better options
bad,"Don't care about employees, short everybody on commissions on a commission only job. I submitted commission adjustment 5 times for $980 that I was owed was kicked back each time for a different reason. I resigned and was going to go to the labor board and the IRS and guess what I received my money. The company is a meat grinder on employees."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Worked in all 5 boroughs. Learned how to interact with people and develop a conversational and interactive skills. Management was subpar. The hardest part of the job was that it was a door to door job rain, sleet, snow, wind and sale a product that many people do not want."
bad,"80-hour weeks spent driving all over the state to visit with prospects who are not properly pre-screened. After the initial paid training period, the position is 100% commission. The company provides a car allowance of $ 85 per week, which does not begin to cover the expense of gasoline and wear and tear on one's personal vehicle. If, after having spent 80 hours driving all over the state, one has not sold enough to satisfy management, management demands that one go door-to-door to attempt to make more sales. This is a classic ""churn and burn"" operation. They constantly train new people to replace the sales people who come to their senses and realize that running on the treadmill is not the same as covering real ground."
bad,It was hard work selling door to door but at the end the day it was
bad,"After working just over a year with the company, I have found out that not only the miles placed on your personal vehicle are high, the stakes are even higher when jobs you have sold get lost to competition due to lack of management assistance. When a sold job is lost, you recieve a chargeback of the commisions paid to you up front, taxes not included. Meaning that you pay taxes each time your paid and is not re-compensated if you resell the job originally sold."
bad,"In the interview they promise quite a large commision / sale. BUT: they fail to mention that if the customer stops the service (which is quite common) within the first year and a half, you have to give thet ENTIRE commision BACK !!!! The last week I worked there the guy next to me OWED ADT over $1000. And your main competition is the other 10 people from ADT working in the same territory."
bad,This job was not for me it was mainly a summer job that i got my freshman year of college. pretty much all i did was call customers and try to sell them ADT's product
bad,"Their corporate HR found my resume and set up the interview with the district manager. HR sent me an e-mail on how to dress and act at the interview (I'm over 55 - I know this stuff). Manager looked at me long enough to say hello, then played with his I-Pad during the entire interview. Next day they tell my I'm not a good fit for the company. What a bunch of babies."
bad,"The company is a complete joke! You get no leads, you make no $, there are no managers."
bad,"Worst work environment, unreal, unfair, terrible diversity"
bad,Education is not important. Most of the management team has only a high school education. Education is not a requirement for promotions within the company.
bad,"Daily - Worked With Customer's Resolve Problems, Disputes, Customer Retention Via Phone Or In Person. Learned How Important It Is To Listen & Assist Frustrated Customers. Management Was Awful Lot Of Favoritism, No Recognition For Jobs Well Done. Lots Of ""Cliques"" Very Unfair Company Most Co-Workers Were Willing To Assist Others When Needed - I Am A Tean Player & Do Not Like Or Agree With Managers That Play Favorites. Enjoyed Ability To Resolve Customer Issues And Give Customer 100% Respect & Satisfaction."
bad,"Dont waste your time. Awful pay, awful management and no benefits."
bad,"Watch out they are very petty and unfair and they may give you a 14 cent raise after you have killed yourself to make your stats for quality The team managers are horrible and if you have children they don't understand when you have doctors appointments to be off.  Don't even think about working here, even if you do mind your own business the employees on the team are messy"
bad,Just a bad place to work. Every task has to be performed by the first and last technician. All problems are the techs fault. All is dumped on the field tech
bad,"They suggest $650-$1000 per week, but do not constantly put you in a position to make that amount. It is 100% commission based and you get paid after the installation date. Employees and managers are not inclusive and they do segregate vans to work. It is based on favors not professional."
bad,Son unos esplotadores te esprimen y en un lapso no mayor a tres meses te echan estresa total
bad,Management now has nothing good to offer. Poor management and the new managers that do not know anything. They never want to help. you will always feel overworked. Sales department is the worst all over canada. Montreal department all of the departments most poor functioning I do not know why they are still operating there people they have hired in montreal the know nothing. Nobody is there to help customers. Literally they charge customers even if they have cancelled the account with them. Payroll department misses payments now and then. All in all not enough salary and way lot of stress
bad,"When I was working there they were pushing field techs so hard that 2 fell asleep at the wheel of their company vehicles and wrecked them.  Most were divorced because of the work life there.  The pay was not enough for what they were asking and they were asking non sales people to push products on people.  They monitored everything your work vehicle did and even if you were about to die from heat exhaustion you were not to idle it for AC.  Technicians were treated poorly and even passed on for promotions because they were ""Too Valuable in the field"".  Office staff handling things didn't have a clue what needed to be done.  A job that would take 2 days would be scheduled for 2 hours...  Often required to work on new tech with no training.  Inventory was never what you needed. "
bad,Don’t waste your time working for ADT.  They are organized extremely bad and will probably get absorbed and buys them.  I have made very good money by buying put options for their stock.  Take a look at their stock over the past year and you will see what I mean
bad,"Worked very hard, produced results only to be stripped of rightfully earned commission because customers cancel on ADT services. No base pay, pure commission."
bad,"They are not consistent policy always chamging based on there needs and not for the employees And when changes are made we find out about it at The last minute. Managers not knowledgeable they just mirco manage, the call center is running itself"
bad,very poor uneducated management and customer service they do not know what is going on in a field customer service feeds customers with promises that will not be delivered lots of stress throughout the day and NO APPRECIATION nobody is ever happy(management) they are very pushy and not honest there is NO ETHICS in this place
bad,"ADT hired a class of 20 and lost nearly half before they hit the floor. You already expect rude customers, that comes with customer service but management works very hard at driving away most talent.You now need an ok to go use the restroom."
bad,The worst manager in the world. Does not give you the time of day unless your sucking up to her 24hrs a day and this is something I wasn’t going to do. I enjoyed the work I did at Adt but am really disappointed by the way I was treated by my manager compared to others in the same position as me.
bad,"Adt has become a non productive place to work, the culture is bad, management is bad and the overall company is headed in the wrong direction. The provide bad products and blame the employees for those same products failing."
bad,"If you learn to love the customer's (which by the way is really, really hard) then upper management steps in and sucks all the happiness out of you. All the Stats at ADT are unattainable. You have to meet with a manager each week - which is way too much, unless a Gen Care Agent was telling the customer the incorrect information daily! I dread going to work each day and I really think ADT is a shame and sells security equipment at a 95% increase and then 3/4 of the time it is not installed correctly-as well as having customer's pay for a Quality Service Plan (for their equipment) monthly - that they can never use because ADT wants their customers to fix all the problems with their Security systems by themselves. (See myadt.com)."
bad,The AGM was arrogant and vindictive. During labor negotiations he enjoyed doing things to technicians to anger and frustrate the. He makes sure he is never held accountable and ignores his employee needs. I hope other AGM's promote a less hostile work environment. I have never worked for a more uncaring person.
bad,"This job is a not for most people  to say the least. They are losing customers and lie so much to potential customers and mess them up into contracts. So people have 72 hours to cancel with no problems when they call in they must have a contract, which they may not get from a 3rd party vendor like defenders. Now the big issue is you can not really help a customer. We have 345 seconds on each  calls, to trouble shoot and fix all the problems. That is 5 minutes and 45 seconds, we all can agree someone explain an issue can take a few minutes. We need people to do self help and send self help information. We also charge to go out to change batteries. We can only have a 7 percent job creation and can not have call backs. This is almost impossible. The company wants us not to help customers and keep raising the stats to make any head way, oh do you need to go to the restroom? Not here you better not you will get fired. If you go in to emergency aux because you have to use the restroom you have to explain it and it still takes you out of adherence. You can not get off the phone for any reason, we were supposed to help people.But, now we can not have a high handle time or create jobs, so in fact we can not help that effectively.  Do you like mandatory over time? Well welcome aboard. The sites are critically understaffed. You should have a few minutes between calls to not feel stressed and like a robot. Not here the moment you log into the phone you are busy, meetings get canceled and you are never up to date on any change. You will get emails, that your supposed to read in between calls,"
bad,"I was blindsided upon taking this position. It was not truthfully advertised. I don't believe they give new hires the tools to become successful. Management is not supportive of creating an environment to support new hires have the help they need when they need it and the culture sucks. There is a high turnover because of that and because management is so focused on trying to get new people that they are not helping the employees they currently have. Communication from management is hostile at times and very demanding. Talk to adults as adults, not as crabs on line in the band. Four people that are on the same team have quit within a three month period."
bad,"En Mcallen, Texas ADT tiene un gerente de ventas muy impreparado e inmaduro. Ademas de no saber preparar al personal, se mofa de la ayuda cuando se le requiere esa ayuda."
bad,"The Walligford Ct. office demanded sales.When you wanted leads,there were very few.You destroyed your car by driving endless miles.There was always a little tension in the sales office."
bad,Where do I begin. It’s messy call center basically high school all over again . Ghetto . Have clock out to use bathroom. Have pay for hour lunch . Micro management. Screen shot your computer with out your knowledge. Have work holidays . All people do talk about people . Have sit at a new desk every day with seating chart.
bad,"I was an employee for 19 years with much more to give, this company puts the wrong people in place to be leaders. Disrespecting and demoralizing your team is not the way to lead, making people feel as though they are interviewing or fighting for the position they are in every day is pathetic. "
bad,"A typical call center sales workday includes very competitive environment which can be for you or stacked against you. This is an incoming call environment. The commission pay scale is such that it penalizes you for using FMLA, vacation or sick time. The equations used for commission is based on several factors that are outside of your control. Your commission payout is based on a comparison of you vs how your peers are performing as is your shift schedules. Management determines who they want as ""top performers"" and will filter calls and sales opportunities to those persons. This means that although you may have sales with a close rate of 80% in your sales you may only get pennies on the dollar where a ""preferred employee"" can have a close rate of 20% and can be the highest paid commissions for selling the same items. They also require you to compete with other sales persons in call centers accross the country. There has been a problem where coworkers are ""stealing"" sales that are already sold in order to boost top performers numbers. Management will not produce data used to pay commission or how they verify sales person's data since it comes down to how you compare to someone else. Management is vindictive and critical on a daily basis. Favoritism is apparent to all. The call center part of the company is no longer an equal opportunity employer.  As long as you stay a liked associate you will be fine but if management turns, you will have a major decrease in sales or advancement opportunities, decrease in pay and shifts bids for schedules."
bad,"The company structure is changing rapidly and is very unfriendly to Sales Reps and fired a lot of admin people, very cut throat. Managers have a very high turn over rate as well"
bad,"no appreciation of employees. advancement was based on how much management liked you, not related to work effort or performance. pay was minimal but was also commission based."
bad,"Micro Management at its best, culture there is very depressing. Hostile environment. Pay was the only good thing about working there but they dont see a person for a person but for a number and what that number does and does not do. Most of the focus on what you do not do. No recognition or sense of being appreciated."
bad,"Unprofessional environment , supervisors are biased. There is no room for career advancement. If you transfer out of the inbound department to another department you're given an overwhelming amount of work with little pay."
bad,"Company has been used as a vehicle for executives and board members to extract money for most of this decade. ADT=ATM. Each management team installed is worse than the one which came before. Current group is least employee-focused yet (and that is a high bar to clear). Advancement is difficult and promotion raises are capped at 5% so if you stick around for long, you'll be paid far less than your market value. Zero community involvement. Zero employee engagement. Technology is outdated."
bad,"Training is horrible. Worked in loyalty.  New rule, when too many calls in que, which is always, you had to ask permission to go tinkle.poor managemnt"
bad,Manager in charge of my department did not have a clue about what he was doing. They did not treat there employees with respect and there was no appreciation for the job done.
bad,"Absolutely worst management to work under. Company was better before new management. Terrible work environment, NO support for office staff, there is favoritism between management teams so most employee's are treated unfairly.  Poor customer service. Branch makes up their own regulations to override Mass Laws, which is unlawful. Technicians are not compensated travel time. Docked for lunch breaks while working through them."
bad,I hope you can come in with a background of security sales as the training is poor to non-existent and the management doesn't care about the reps as they know they will turn them over by the end of the year. There is over 100% turnover per year in the sales force. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone EVER
bad,"Mi evaluacion de la empresa es asi por mala gestion de parte de jefaturas , mala administracion y sin respeto al trabajador que realiza turnos 24*7 , solo se preocupan de los trabajadores acomodados e ineficientes."
bad,There are much better companies out there that are stable. ADT is positioned to be all 3rd party sales and no employees in house. Pay has dropped over 70 percent. Beware
bad,"constant monitoring of employees via recorded calls, GPS, and vehicle audio and video surveillance "
bad,"The culture of this company is the most backwards that I have EVER seen.  Performance is quickly forgotten and the only emphasis is ""what are you going to do for me today?!""  The management actually encourages not taking care of past customers because that's time lost that you could be looking for new customers.  The revenue that you generate in sales is not important because they would rather have 10 iffy customers paying $5 than to have one really great customer paying $50.  This is by far the worst place that I have ever worked in all of my years on this planet."
bad,"They have training in Dallas Texas almost every week"
bad,"high pressure low return for your work. "
bad,".management is petty and childish. very clique-ish and advancement in the company is virtually impossible, they don't care about the customers or employees"
bad,"I have been here for 10 years this year and I have loved working here. I have been on the social committee for a good part of my time here arranging Year End Functions as well as fun events for the company such as Spring Day Fun, Soup Selling, Braais, Cooking competitions.  I loved my co-workers and learn a lot from all of them and have formed personal relationships with most of them.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people and the pressure working the management office is high but once all things are done, it was worth the stress and the pressure and I enjoyed that."
bad,"In the 5 years I spent there, the only reason I stayed was because I felt loyal to my customers.  ADT Corporate could care less about it's employees or customers. They will lie to both, not fulfill promises to customers and micro manage you to Death."
bad,"Just don't do it, please. Its a job yes, but they absolutely don't care if you die sitting in your chair or work van. Just avoid the company all together, its much better to start your carrier out with a dealer or even Comcast"
bad,"Absolutely rediculous unorganized company"
bad,I loved representing the technology in residential home sales.
bad,"Constant change is the only thing to look for here. Recruited from salaried sales job with expensive benefits to this place. The only thing they told the truth about was the cost of the benefits. Training was thorough, marketing phased out leaving entire field force with no leads, no sales and no opportunity, other than ""go out and make it happen!"" I wich I could have the last nine months back."
bad,Micro managed with no clear direction on where you were going or how you get there.
bad,"When I was looking for a job, a family member who had previously worked here told me it was a great place to work. I gave it a shot, got the position, and found out that they were absolutely right - it was great! I had an awesome manager, my coworkers were great, the pay was good, and the job was fulfilling. At this time, I was working for Brink's Home Security, and I bled blue working hard for this company - I was happy and proud to work here. The company took care of ita customers, and it took great care of its employees as well. I felt like my employer cared about me as a person, because they did."
bad,"This so-called sales 'job', to sum this up, let me just tell you that I recently found my ADT national instructor's mugshot for a forgery charge a few years back."
bad,"If your thinking of being free to earn big cash and gain promotion think again, stay in the box and don't think outside of it."
bad,Not enought commission for all the pushing from management
bad,"dn unprofessional, work life balance not good, overtime and shift schedules sucks. Very stressful. Leads and coaches are mean and not helpful. The company services are not good. The cameras never work for customers."
bad,"It is a straight commission job If you don't have money when you start it is really hard to survive trying to built in to your future"
bad,A day at work was full of stress and worry if what you did was correct or legally able to be done honestly one of the worst places I can say someone could work at besides a fast food place I would not recommend this company though your direct managers are wonderfull people but after them not to much.
bad,"The work is easy its the management and ppl thats there make it hard, the leads do management job they have the picks on who they like and don’t likes its been so many heated arguments on the floor with threats and calling each other out there names it’s ridiculous and guess what everyone still has they job I have a heard a lead make a comment saying she want to see a fight I work there for 2in half years and decided it was not for me any more"
bad,"Worst management I've ever worked for in the Morrisville NC office. Low communication between managers, no concerned for customer service after a sale is made."
bad,"The original ADT Security Services (American District Telegraph Co.) was a fantastic place to work and was corporately run since 1876. The customer service was provided by local offices directly employed by ADT corporate. The service was top notch and the employees (Sales, Service and Installation) lived in the areas they served and had offices where customers could actually contact them directly. Not just the 800# call center which was available 24/7, but speak to them over the phone or face to face.  There was a personal investment in the care and integrity because though ADT was world wide, the local offices were neighbors of sorts and their loyalty and referrals reflected the confidence in ADT. All that ended and the Commercial accounts were separated from Residential and Small Business and operated under the acquisition giant TYCO International. Local offices were closed and eventually the Residential and Small Business sales staff lost jobs because Authorized Dealers with mail and newspaper flyers took over. Their advertisements gave the appearance of it still being ADT. The only thing truly ADT are the monitoring centers which, to be honest, are the best available to the public. The Sales, Service and Installation are ALL through Authorized Dealers and there is no personal incentive aside from monetary to provide the service the original ADT was famous for. The name recognition local employees all across the country built and maintained. Working for what is left is an impersonal machine.This is the new American way, but from an original ADT employee's standpoint, no authorized"
bad,Management is manipulative and will ask you to do illegal things and work outside of your job description. They do not care about your home life balance they only want money so if you want to work to death and probably end up divorced and lonely work here.
bad,I accepted a position as an Technical Assistance Representative. The position was nothing like they described. Also the metrics are inhumane. You take back to back calls with no break in between and outside of breaks and lunches only can take 5 minutes of bathroom breaks. If you go over that they will meet with you. The management is unprofessional and incompetent.  I would never recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,ADT shows pictures of happy employees but ask a technichan about the company and see what they have to say.  Technichans are treated like a number.  Your hard work just amounts to being tired all the time.
bad,"I have been working for this company a few years I was going to leave a yr in a half in was transferred to another dept felt like it would work but shortly after the same tactics took place. Very poor unprofessional management and regardless of how many complaints is put in to HR nothing gets resolved.They are not a company about employees they only care about numbers. The HR is even unprofessional your checks are wrg constantly and they make up stories to get you terminated alot of favoritism "
bad,"This job sucks. I was interviewed and asked only one question to two different managers. ""Are you required to work mandatory overtime?"" Both times I was given a reassuring ""no we never do that"". Two months later we are given mandatory overtime. They limit when you can do your overtime, which means they are forcing you to work it to benefit themselves. Not a family company."
bad,"A company that is drowning. Laid off so much of the field service team, customers are leaving out of frustration.  Recently replaced most of the management and is being run out of the US. Trying to sign up enough customers every month to make up for the ones they lose"
bad,"I worked at ADT for 17 year and every year was told things would get better,"
bad,"Lack of communication between higher ups and staff, everyone has to bid for their shift they already agreed to even if they have been working the same shift for years come Aug 2019, you don't receive your double overtime pay until 2-3 paychecks later, the point sys for attendance is flawed,anyone with access can increase or delete points, the new hires are being paid more than ppl who have been there for years, several managers purposefully try to fire you for reasons that if u were on another managers team u wouldn't be fire for etc. I could continue. I worked at the Irving Texas call center and if u need a job apply you will be hired just know you are just a body in a seat. Two of my co workers were fired for being hospitalized!!!!! Was under doctors care and all."
bad,"They lied about compensation. I was told 6 months of salary to start. I was not allowed to sell security for two months because of training, Then I was told because I did not sell in those two months I would not get a salary only commission."
bad,"Great brand recognition, easy to sell service. However, terrible business model and structure making everything chaotic and stressful.  Customer service is terrible and client on boarding and fulfilment is awful."
bad,"Easy work, but not so comfortable environment when you're being watched like you're a zoo animal & Managers are the spectators. Don't waste your time."
bad,"Underpaid for work performed. Managers are former field techs who"
bad,"Used to Bleed Blue, Now with 20 years on the job its quite cleard they HATE Blue shirts and love cheap Felon Sub-Contractors.... Stay Clear of this Place it is a Sunken Ship thanks Apollo"
bad,"Corporate politics as usual. The kiss-ups always got the praise and credit. The loyal employees always got the shaft. I did my job day in and day out. In the end, they screwed me and a lot of other guys over."
bad,"In the Alarm Sales Business this company takes the LARGEST PORTION.. With $350.00 taken from EVERY TRANSACTION plus  you pay for equipment, installation and you are on a tiered pay scale based on your clients credit...They make as much as you do, yet you do all the work!!!!"
bad,Micromanage from the time you start you company vehicle to the time you turn it off adt has unfair matrix on o how they rate your daily performance for sevice and install  technitions they are forcing you to upsell to customers to the point where your job depends on it
bad,"Home Security Industry has many players . ADT corporate is the biggest in the Industry ."
bad,"Unprofessional management, bad work culture, no hierarchy in teams. No recognition for real qualifications and performance rather Management cultivates buttering up from team members."
bad,Unprofessional environment. An Adult Day Care Center where even the managers are childish. Every day was a hostile work environment  with people who like to refer to you as an idiot rather than answer questions about complicated systems or situations that could affect your bonus.
bad,management   they just do nothing and should be out of business soon.have heads in the sand.  dont know what is happening  i have said ll that i need to in this spot.
bad,This job had amazing benefits for medical and dental and is good for someone who likes to sit all day behind a desk with fast calls back ti back. The job itself is good but the management is bad
bad,"1.  Worst management in the world - truly."
bad,"Managers LOVE to complain. Emails, phone calls, text messages, voicemails, face to face  - all of the above are done on a daily basis to higher admins. None of the in house managers know what they are doing. Constantly making errors & blaming it on other employees, throwing them under the bus daily. Some techs were lazy & stealing from the company under operations nose. Other techs are great & work hard. In house managers NEED training desperately. There is lack of common sense in all areas. Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians."
bad,Management picks favorites. Co workers are rude and ugly toward each other. You have to wait to find a seat. Nobody backs you. The customers are abusive.
bad,"No advancement opportunities and new pay scale wasn't fair to existing employees.  The new pay plan should have consider time and experience on the job,"
bad,"see above,  if you actually need to earn a living a small stipend is provided for about 4 months, then job goes to straight commission.some leads are provided but not enough qualified leads are made available to make  straight commission structure work."
bad,Management lacked management skills. The calls were back to back most of the time and you would get written up for any and every little thing. A lot of drama is what you will find at this place.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Stay away , don't waste your time with them. All they care about are numbers. They care more about numbers then they do there employees. Really sad. They've had a dozen of people get fired or quit. If your looking for a good company to work for ... this isn't it.."
bad,"The job culture and professionalism is poor, lack of training, promoted quick but things changed because of poor management that we have now. Very unprofessional establish, that includes management and some agents"
bad,"The only positive thing I can say about ADT is that they get involved in the community, at least once a year and they make donations to worthwhile causes"
bad,Unfortunately they don't care about their employees well being. The pay is terrible.  The hours are very long.  The location was very dirty and unsanitizon't I don't  recommend working here.
bad,"The work environment was stressful. The environment was racist and sexist. It was difficult to learn the business because of the environment. I worked as part of a team, together we accomplished a sales goal, where bonus money was rewarded. I did not receive the bonus."
bad,"Asked to essentially trick people in to signing contracts, taught how to talk people in to products and services they didn't really need - highly unethical."
bad,Was a very stressful job with usually unrealistic deadlines feel like they don't care about employees until they get a bad review then they take measures to fix but quickly fall off the band wagon only care about money and not the services they provide after 10 years of being ranked one of the countries top installers they fired me over 5 min late to customers house when traffic conditions where not ideal every employee is EXPENDABLE!!
bad,"Terrible management, terrible work culture.  I wouldn't suggest working there. It was the  worst company I have ever worked for. They used to discriminate against employees and treat one person one way and someone else completely different."
bad,"This route is a dead end"
bad,"they will hire some else with a better pay to put you down and hire people outside to become managers. There is no advancement only an endless road lead to no where, unless you wan to work for 10+ years to get a supervisor role."
bad,"This company does have its positive points, but overall it is a very demanding and unfriendly business. I have witnessed many hard working and dedicated employees/managers come and go and they usually do not leave on good terms. Most of the employees are very dedicated and care about serving its customers, but my overall consensus of this company is that it is not an employee friendly place to work."
bad,"I cannot explain how horrible of a company ADT is. "
bad,"This is an excellent company for consumers, but the way the employees are treated is sub par.  Many of the employees have more knowledge and skills than the managers. Overtime is mandatory on a daily basis, even when the work load is not heavy."
bad,"Door knocking mentality and disconnected management.  All of management is so busy communicating via conference calls and email chains, that no one knows what is going on."
bad,I would not recommend the company to anyone.the management is incomompetent.salary does mot match your job description.they dont live their values.very racist company.uneducated supervisors.they need to do a research on how to run a call centre.everyone is just rude
bad,If it wasn't for management not knowing how to run a department than this might have gone a different way.  But when they dont know what they are doing and ruin peoples moral it sucks.
bad,"Not recommended. "
bad,"I have experience in sales. I had a boss that liked to belittle me- give me lists to call for appointments, 85% of those calls were to existing business. I had no field support, none what so ever. The manager would brag about his success, but would hide in his office and not support any new sales people. He would also brag about what a rip off the product was, how a consumer could get the same exact thing for half of the price. Very poor reimbursement and they encouraged several hours of driving for appointments with little compensation. Worst sales job ever."
bad,"Working for adt as a residential technician was a great experience, my fellow techs, admin, and warehouse personal were like family to me."
bad,"door to door, cold cal selling in residential neighborhoods. Was forced to push customers into buying our services and proudcts."
bad,great place to work if ur only in need of a paycheck.. alot of nice people working there but the job itself is non stop back to back calls from angry customers
bad,1. require you to be in the office at 8am and make phone calls from 9-12 every day and you are a full commission employee. you are expected to train your self because the managers are to busy on conference calls. the longest tendered rep is 8 mo. everyone working there is looking for new employment
bad,I was hired on the spot with no background check and no information taken. I only worked on commission annoying people over the phone bout an over priced security system.
bad,"Door to door sales."
bad,"Training for position leaves a lot to be desired. More time during training spent on easiest portion of the position. Employees on early shift work every Saturday and days off not together. No shift differential for Saturdays. Serious lack of communication, employees are not given heads up on upcoming specials. Expect emails to be read on your own time. Antiquated systems. Low pay for the amount of work expected."
bad,"Unnecessary micro- management, which is uncalled for being that after the 1st 3 months the compensation is 100% commission. Not having a salary is more than enough motivation to go into the field and sell, no need to have a manager complicating ones life."
bad,"Know alot, and learn it yourself. No training and not a real chance for any advancement. No support in learning and growing. Lots of driving. Alot of people to answer to and no one knows anything."
bad,"The turn over is high, like any 100% commission job. Bad customer service which makes it difficult to retain clients or get them to return. Most  often customers leave as soon as contract is over. The best part of the job,  working with my co-workers."
bad,No family time and you travel a lot!! Its not your typical install you sell the system and it puts you on the spot if you dont sell you really dont make any money.
bad,"Working for ADT, I had to be at the first job by 8 AM, this sounds easy, until the first job is 2 hours away. Sometimes leave the house at 6:30, the earliest we had to leave our house except on meeting days, sometimes leaving a 7:15. The jobs on the computer the night before may not be the same jobs you wake up to, and no one ever called to tell you that the schedule was changed. So, thinking you could leave at 7:15, now you find out you are late. ADT expects you to complete 6 jobs per day, while upselling each customer, as a service technician we were there to fix something that didn't work, most often the customer just wants the equipment to work in the first place, but try to upsell we must. Back to the 6 jobs per day, they tell you it's only 5 jobs per day, but they mean 6, they do not take in to consideration the 200 miles that you were scheduled to drive, but still expect the 5 or 6 jobs regardless. If you do not meet the 5 or 6 per day your numbers go down, if a customer chooses to miss the service call by not being home, or they decided to reschedule, your numbers go down. If a customer chooses to change internet providers within 30 days and the cameras go off line, when you were sent there to work on the front door contact, your numbers go down."
bad,There’s a lot of favoritism at ADT and lack of consistency! Nothing is confidential with HR so BEWARE of what is said. The team managers will know exactly what is said.
bad,"I’ve worked at several call centers and this wasn’t the worse but definitely not the best. Management definitely needs improvement, and also a better open door policy."
bad,"Adt management is horrible. They do not follow their own policies. They constantly lie to the technicians, shorten drive times and jobs in order to overbook your day and then threaten to write you up/ terminate you for low productivity. Shortening jobs and drive times allows for no lunch breaks, but when you do not take a lunch they threaten you or just suspend you. Then towards the end of your day when you see that there is no way at all you can make the rest of your jobs within the time frame, you find out that no one has called to inform the customers that you will be late.  Management always has something negative to say about your performance, and majority of your customers are mad because of the lack of accountability with customer service agents and productivity specialists failing to do their jobs.  I cannot speak for all branches of ADT, but the Austin branch only cares about money.  I would not suggest anyone work for this branch, unless there is a major overhaul done with upper management.  Morale is low, everyone is stressed well beyond a reasonable amount.  Who wants a security company that lies to its own customers?"
bad,This company doesn’t care about their employees or their customers. After seeing the internal workings of this place I could never have an alarm system installed in my home.
bad,I can’t tell for other department but tech support is one of the worse places to work at. Really bad management. Salary is not enough for everything they ask you to do. Avoid to all cost you can find better anywhere else . McDonald’s kinda of job .
bad,ADT likes to micro manage  specially in the nationals monitoring department . It’s like you’re back in high school. If management see you talking to your coworkers they’ll move you seats (even tho they have daily sitting charts management created) just so you can’t have a conversation with someone. I don’t recommend working thaere. You all can find better jobs on this app don’t waste your time. I hate that place with a passion!  DO NOT WORK ADT NATIONALS!!!
bad,"I loved the protection 1 office I used to work at but after moving and transferring to an ADT office everything went downhill. Upper management at adt is awful and nobody cares about customers or employees, only numbers and money. Stay as far away as possible from ADT, they're too big for their britches. I doubt they'll ever go out of business cause they're so big and have so many steady customers so nothing will ever change I'm sure"
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've had, with poor working conditions, and a manager who made horrible offensive jokes, and only offered commission for payment."
bad,"Out of all the companies I have worked for I would rate this one the worse because of local management. I have never worked for a company that paid a 100% commision and only .15 cents a mile. I took this job because of the strong name. There is a high turn around in employment, over 75% employees there for less than a year. The local manager is horrible, he has no people skills and not a good manager. When you are a manger and hire people you do the best to develop them in becoming better than they already are. Not all employees are treated fairly especially women. Not a good place to work."
bad,This place is not my type of company. They are over staffed because of the high turn over rate and only allow 2 people off per shift and theres nearly 50 people a shift so you never get to take off. Most of the staff and supervisor are Hispanic and it seemed a little racist to me.
bad,"New ppl starting every week and so many ppl either quitting or getting fired-for all kinds of reasons. The pay is close to minimum wage, for a call center and the amount of calls, you could get paid much more somewhere else."
bad,"ADT does not appreciate hard work. The harder I worked, the more hours i put in, the success that i had, matter very little if at all to ADT. They have the name recognition.and that gives them the inclination to treat their employees with little regard. Unless you're desperate, avoid ADT."
bad,"ADT attracted me because of the potential for setting my own schedule and seemingly high-income potential. However, what they don't tell you at the field rep interview is that your real competition is ADT itself. Whether it's second-hand leads their corporate sales have already worked-over, sales lost to ADT 1-800 tv ads, flyers & call center sales or the many independent companies ADT has a contract with to ultimately gain their customers monitoring services from. It's very difficult to make money unless you catch new movers before anyone else in the industry does, they invite you in and sign-up that day. Even then, you have to hard-sell the ADT name & history over less expensive security hardware & installation pricing. As an investor in ADT, one might be more secure, as their long game is geared for monitor contracts, not new sales. As an independent rep on straight commission, forget it. Too much is working against your best hustle in the field or skills at the kitchen table. Technology is fast making old-line companies like ADT resting on their past laurels industry laggers, not leaders. The only reps I knew making a living there had shady practices not taught in the new hire training or afterwards -and they were made the field trainers! No thank you. Meanwhile, the weekly office training I experienced was fractured, confusing and costly. I loved consulting on home security and was good at it, but hated the ADT corporate experience altogether. I was very disappointed to feel the need to move on. Good luck!"
bad,This has to be the worst Job I have ever had they lie in training and tell you all these great things but when you get on the floor it’s all lies!! They over work you and you better believe you are not getting Pto easily at this company you will have the time available to use but they won’t let you use it and their reason is because they need you there to take calls they don’t care anything about your family life or your life outside of work they want to work you like a slave they will even call you on your off day and bug you to come in their unorganized no one is on the same page at this company not one person they penalize you for things that Out of your control and they have bugs they don’t have assigned desk they give you so you have to fight for a seat I could go on and on just RUN do not pass go do not collect whatever money they are offering you will be glad you didn’t that’s is why they are always hiring because people are always leaving.
bad,"Growing up your folks always tell you to leave on a good note. "
bad,"ADT was bought out by a parent company ( Apollo ) who also purchased another alarm services company, "" Protection 1"" It was after this merger that all metrics changed to unattainable goals, which in my opinion were made to break up the union in place and to to bring in Protection 1 employees outside the Union. Upper management left, including my manager and his immediate , and outside management was brought in who knew nothing of the industry, other than being the pawn to hire/fire current employees"
bad,"A total unprofessional atmosphere. The staff shows up when they want and don't really connect to their staff. I have never heard of a large company of this size that really doesn't train their people properly. Fortunately, I did not stay long once a got a good look at how they operate. I honestly felt we were treated like a number. "
bad,"I was originally hired as a Technical Support representative.I was told that was all I was going to do. They forced me into the billing department with no raise in pay. Then later forced me into their loyalty department. I do not recommend working for this company. "
bad,"If you like getting yelled and cussed at by callers as well as getting it from your lead for not dealing with it then this is the perfect place for you. "
bad,ADT says they will move you up and they are customer obsessed. What they really mean is that they want you to work for free and do all the work without a title. The management is confused and upper management doesnt care.
bad,Years ago they were a great company. Now it is the worst poorly managed company in the world. The Rochester location has horrendous upper management. They don't care about their employees. Everyone is micro managed and the rules change minute by minute. Don't let their nice looking facility fool you. They say they are all about a professional culture yet they hire so many unprofessional unqualified people that negatively impact the work environment
bad,"I wanted to try something different."
bad,"There was almost no supervision, guidance, or assistance. Most employees were miserable and considered the position a place to grind out a few paychecks until they could get better employment. The communication between the sales force and the installers was always contentious."
bad,"I started ADT and was so excited because I loved selling and really had a passion for delivering A1 customer service, but not too long after starting things got weird.."
bad,"Wro ng time scheduling by schedu;ling department.

Crawling in attics and underneath.                                                     Wireing."
bad,"Management cant take the fact that a regular employee knew more than they did, and its all a number driven environment.  This is a company that should be more concerned with customer safety, but they are not.  as long as the job gets done they dont care if its correct or not."
bad,"My manager was in a different state than me, but within driving distance. I saw him twice in 6 months. Hands off approach. Disorganized. I was promised a reasonable training salary for 6 months and it was gone after 3 at which point I was put on commission only. Huge disconnect between install employees and the sales employees. "
bad,"Great environment for learning.  Unfortunately, there is nor enough room for growth in this environment."
bad,"As a Small Business rep, I was told I would be making anywhere from 60K plus... Not true.  More like 20K.  The unethical practices that the Bakersfield office hosts will make you sick.  Make you poor and teach you to be a very dishonest salesperson.  The installers will undersell you right out of a contract, the sales manager will be on everybody's side other than the sales people. You just have to work there to find out for yourself."
bad,"My role as Service Team Manger was to oversee service operations for over 100,000 ADT customers in the Central and Northern regions of Arizona.  With a team of 25 technicians I was kept busy managing a large number of potential issues.  My main focus was insuring quality service while having to operate within an ever deflating operational budget.  As a former lead installation technician I had a vast knowledge of technical experience that was called upon for field tech training and sales consults.  I was also responsible for maintaining other metrics that pertained to the overall customer experience such as the median time to resolve a customer issue, and overall sat. scores from customer surveys."
bad,"A typical day is busy, what I learned is I can accomplish alot by prioritizing my tasks. Management does not want to make things better or does not care to be bothered when issues arise. Co-workers do unethical things, don't feel secured. Hardest part of the job is still working there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the end of my shift."
bad,very unorganized nasty working environment good working scheudule
bad,"enjoy the customer service experience"
bad,ADT is customer come first. They that it is required for a degree yet there are many position which is given due to favoritism
bad,"I do not enjoy it one bit. You are just a number and not a person. It works for some people but I feel that i'm too opinionated and not a droid to have to deal with an environment as such. The corporate trainers are awesome, although you see them once in a blue moon. With that being said you rely on your sales manager to train you. Not a good idea since all they do is sit behind their computers and take conference calls all day. The corporate group is great as I said, but the immediate supervision and training I was to receive was low grade and might contribute to the very high turnover rate. Seriously there is corporate training when you start out that runs 44 weeks a year. Which means there is a full time position dedicated to just training the new batch that comes in. 44 weeks a year seems alot when you take in effect that vacation and holidays play a role in there as well."
bad,"The benefits and compensation are good, though the people that you work with will simply suck the life out of you and your family life.  There is no job security as upper management promotes from within the boys club and not based on performance.  Management has very loose morals and ethical values.  Expect to work 80 hours a week+ with your base compensation.  There is just no time for work life balance and you'll be told that.   After 15+ years I was downsized to bring in a younger person at half the salary."
bad,"the company went under SEVERAL big changes. things that they promised employees never happened, such as a sufficient raise ( it was only $.20) and new positions that were created were never available to employees with more tenure. the managers were either not knowledgeable of the companys policies and procedures or didnt care to assist with the issues that arose over the phone. the employees were inappropriate and obnoxious. "
bad,"Everyday was exactly the same thing. There was nothing different from day to day. Same tasks, same people, basically working towards nothing."
bad,Too much micro-management
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work for the billing dept, it is very stressful and fast paced you barely get any help form the managers they are very lazy and do not want to take calls when the customers ask to speak with a manager, the training does not really prepare you for the calls you will be handling, you get penalized for everything, how many calls you are taking per hour is all they care about they don't care about the customers situations and boy I tell you I had to deal with very irate customers on a daily basis calling you everything but of child of God, it's not worth the headache. They treat employees like children, and you will get fired if you do not meet the company's performance level no matter how hard you worked and tried your best to help their customers."
bad,"Total lack of teamwork between the sales people out in the trenches and the elite hourly ""admin"" people. The amount of paperwork, processing and responsibilities on the sales end, make it hard to believe that the company ever get to this size???"
bad,"ADT will hire anyone who can fog a mirror and pass the standard backround check. Sales positions are 100% commission (except Core). Money can be earned but it's not worth the hassle. Expect to be SEVERELY and incessantly micro-managed at every level of your job. This includes annoying and counter-productive in-office monitoring, conference calls at both the beginning and end of every day. You must call your manager from every appointment in front of the customer. ADT sales is a high-pressure, 'don't take no for an answer' sales position! The ADT culture is contract first, customer last! Be prepared to work on Saturday's with little or no notice. Travel is required with no mileage reimbursement. You may not pre-qualify incoming sales leads, even leads hours away. Expect charge-backs. ADT has three levels of sales positions: Residential; Small Business; and Core. Competition is abundant in the security / video surveillance market with ADT being the most expensive. Turnover is HIGH. ADT sales is perfect for young people with no sales experience because they don't know any better. If you're seasoned in sales and used to working for competent management in a solid company keep looking, this isn't the career for you."
bad,"ADT was a very difficult and inefficient company to work for. The training for the job was somewhat laughable and the company's business plan was very frustrating for employees. New employees were basically forced to learn on the fly in the field without a lot of help from a supervisor. There was a very high turnover rate at ADT. A typical work week was between 50 and 60 hours starting on Monday and ending on Saturday. Appointments could be scheduled anytime between 8 A.M and 10 P.M. The culture of the company was very up tight and negative. The job was 100 percent commission based, and ADT frequently made errors in the amount that employees were suppose to get paid. The hardest part of the job was trying to salvage customers when there were problems with the install of their equipment or their billing cycle. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like I was helping to protect families from invasions and dangers within their own homes."
bad,"very uncomfortable, there is discrimination that happened, and was not a happy experience."
bad,"Manager refused to hire me full time even though I went above and beyond did not miss days in fact walked there in high traffic, rain or heat on time."
bad,"Oppressive management, no sense of company moral, no incentive but money to work hard. Try working for yourself you will have a happier outcome and Babette’s work experience"
bad,"Upper and middle management have continued to degrade as the industry changes, along with employee appreciation and salaries. As so follows the stock."
bad,I would rather not discuss ADT. I started out happy at this job but with all the changes I am not happy at all. This is the reason I am looking for another job.
bad,"Ok so let's be honest...the pay is pretty good. And if 14 hour days in summer and 5 hour days in winter are your thing...then you will love it here. I worked here 5 years as a technician, install for 2 years service for 3. Used to be great but since apollo took over it's awful. Incredibly stressful to hit these ""numbers"" you are graded on. In no way can I recommend working here."
bad,"Anxiety level is high, no security.  New script, scoring, rules Change every week.  Numbers driven and  it’s never enough.  Low pay,   It used to be a great place to work."
bad,Great company if you can stand working with policies that do not pertain to everyone and are used against you.  If you do exactly what you were taught to do you can make any of substantial amount of money yet people in your office get into your business is very hard to focus it is not a good staffed office at least no one that I was working out
bad,"Small department, management was just there no encouragement. Just work that’s it. Nothing special about ADT! Could do better as a big company. Morale could be better"
bad,Prior to the matrix or the numbers game this was an awesome company to work for . You have to learn to be a professional liar ! The new products are poorly manufactured and its a set up for failure. You or someone else will return to repair the same device.
bad,Team manager was clueless. Even the mgmt team wasnt couldn't explain the frequent changes. People quit so often OT became mandatory. Grading system for calls was so silly it became pointless to understand.
bad,Since being bought out ADT employees are now just a number. Do not care about family or you.  Advancement is non existent especially if you are good at your job
bad,I worked at this company for over 20 years. Each year that goes by the company gets worse and worse because they are not owned by one individual looking to advance the company they are owned by holding companies who do not care about employees or the customers only to turn a profit. The local office managers do not know how to manage they bully and look for ways to get rid of employees to bring in cheaper labor. There is no loyalty to any of the employees and they treat you like cattle for the slaughter. I would not recommend anybody to give your time to this company because there is no future and no stability.
bad,"Not worth the pay. Micromanaged, no respect. Always on you about efficiency, productivity, first time fix and making you use refurbished product then you get hit with a go back"
bad,"Unless you make friends with certain people you will be looked at constantly with resentment from management (Certain Managers), The job and pay isn't bad, but hey steer clear if you do not want to be emotionally attacked by other employees and management."
bad,Sent to nasty houses and can have to drive up to 2 hours each way only to be told to leave because they were lied to when setting the appointment. Could work 15 hours in one day and then not get another job for two days. You're on call until 3:00 everyday.
bad,"I  would never suggest this place to my worst enemy to work. Managers don't know anything, if you complain about anything you have to deal with retaliation from management. The stress of working for adt is life threatening.  While working there two people died  and the ambulance is there like ever other day."
bad,they let me go during my training because i wasn't learning things fast enough and they did not offer any support they told me to find something else.
bad,"Selling home security equipment door-to-door is an unfruitful commission work. However, what made it bearable was the energy of the people working with me. The trips to other cities in Ontario were also fun"
bad,"I was a top 1% custom homes rep for ADT for 7 years. Made a ton of money and sales for the company in two different markets."
bad,"The benefits are great but the company as a whole has been lacking since they merged with Protection 1. The call volume is always extremely high because customers never stop having issues after installation. It cost the company money to send techs so we try to troubleshoot and get dinged for unnecessary job creation if a customer refuses to troubleshoot, is too old to troubleshoot or another agent lies about creating a job. You will also get cussed out on callbacks regarding service charges. The phones never stop ringing. Schedule adherence is a joke. If your call runs over, it hurts you. If you go to the bathroom, it hurts you. Things change so often that they barely keep up with uptrainings and even the mangers run away from escalated calls and will waive whatever it takes to avoid even taking the call. If you decide to work here, work in sales, rentention, or collections. General care will cause you to be depressed and burned out in the log run. The turn over is crazy. Once you leave training, you'll probably have 3 coworkers still working with you after 3 weeks. Make sure you get your ADA or FMLA approved in advance to avoid getting written up for taking sick time off. Be prepared to take back to back calls everyday. There's less than 3 seconds between calls at times and don't be surprised if a customer calls back mad because they got disconnected and the agent couldn't call back. Other than that they do give you free food and snacks and blue bucks."
bad,"The upper management has sent a clear message to their Account Executives - They do not care about you.  Last year after the Hurricane they were nice enough to give us $500 for the week we missed due to the weather, then they stopped ALL installs until existing customers were serviced.  Since we are commission only, which isn't paid until accounts are installed, this hurt us bad.  Then they turned the lion share of what used to be company appointments over to phone sales, and gave them access to our leads.  Plus phone sales and dealers often have more aggressive pricing than we do.  Now they have systems in retail stores.  A motion sensor we sell for $170 is $39 or $49.  So as an account executive I lose sales every day --- to ADT.  This is unethical, and quite honestly speaks to the degradation of the corporate culture at ADT. , I could write a book,but let me distill it down for you - Do not apply.  Go work somewhere they care about you and your family. Somewhere that has a personal development program. Somewhere that they care about what happens to you; not just getting the sale at any cost."
bad,"I have worked for this company over 15 years and have never felt more stressed out than I have in the last two years. "
bad,"new management doesn't empower employees.  Divisive environment, no communication, unrealistic goals, sporadic ideas.  The biggest issue is micromanagement by senior leaders.  If you're not in with the management click, you're not valued.  They say you are, but you're not."
bad,manager was horrible...no idea what he was doing and pressured staff with unattainable expectations.  would yell at people in front of peers and co-workers
bad,Managers were great but for some reason they couldn't keep them. You can move up in the company but usually people leave even after they leave. They had a very high turn-over rate. People on the floor was messy and had many arguments as well as fist fights.
bad,"ADT thought they could simply take over a company, change everything that company was doing that made them successful, and it would all work out.  It's funny how the chiefs know better than everyone else and how quickly they can destroy something that took years to achieve.  So if you're the type of sales rep that likes to ""hit and run"", that doesn't believe in building and sustaining relationships with your customers, and doesn't care if your new customers hate your guts, then this is the job for you!"
bad,"This company is great but the authorized Dealer I worked for was absolutely terrible, it had unethical practices, bad structuring of power, and the boss had a very big problem showing favoritism. we would come in to work 10:30 and not go out into the field until 2:00. and the day would end at 5. management was horrible at holding meetings. no training was received, just the pitch they had printed out for us."
bad,Would only recommend to a person that is single with no family. The job a sales rep is very demanding. Management was not very helpful in the training process just very demanding for numbers.
bad,what schedule you get is based on your stats. Stats are very hard to keep up and be of use to the customer. Calls over 5 minutes count aagainst you. I a call goes over into your break you loose that break time.
bad,"ADT used to be a great place to work with great management. Now since the merge/buy-out it is absolutely stressful, turn over rate is high, we are being given work we are NOT TRAINED on then written up if we do something wrong. There is NO CONSISTENCY different managers will tell you different things. Managers will write you up when you do the RIGHT THING according to policy because they don't know the policies. If you are a person who has a family, RUN FAR AWAY because god forbid you need to leave the same day to take care of a sick child you are not able to make time up and it counts against you leading to inevitable termination, if you are sick don't bother bringing in a doctor's note you have to come work while you are contagious or get fired depending on your hours. there are NO EXCUSED absences and they offer flex but you can never use it because we are always too busy. The managers stay on their cellphones, they randomly disappear, policies are constantly changing but we are not being notified we have to find out after doing something the old way, otherwise we are told to review the COUNTLESS policies in our ""downtime"" which we never have. one of their top people even said ""you guys cost us money"" LMAO. other departments make money but general care/billing costs money... I don't see how when they have us taking all the same calls as these other departments we take payments from past due accounts and set up payment arrangements, we save customers from cancelling  by offering lower rates and we do not bonus like those other ""money maker"" departments which i would say in"
bad,Adt is a good company to work for alot of opportunities and working environment is good people you work with are friendly staff hard working company functions are always fun they give compliments to hard working staff members people get recognized
bad,"Poor national, regional and local Management for the Commercial Division from the top down. Poor installation and service department."
bad,Dont dare!!! now why i need to type 150 min to explain why you dont need to work in this underpaid overly stressed h*** hole. That should be enough for you to know not to apply.
bad,"Assist the agents with questions and escalations as well as coach and mentor. I also listened to calls, attended focus meetings, and wrote reviews throughout the year on performance."
bad,"They don't take the time to train you effectively. Manager has to do training with you, yet can't do so due to manager duties. No base just commission in the sales department."
bad,"no base pay ,learned a lot about alarms, management expects free labor, office personnel was great, sales team gets along well, door knocking,freedom."
bad,"Not a great place to work if you are into sales. They harp on you a lot even when you meet quotas, the management doesn't really seem like they are in tune or understand what is going on. It feels like a giant testosterone fest around there, kind of eerie. I did ok but just needed a change out of there."
bad,Look for better opportunities elsewhere. I didnt like the manager relationship to employee... HR was not very helpful in situations either just pretty much making sure that there a** was covered.
bad,"Was there about 8 years ago and was one of the worst mistakes of my life working there. Manager was a total jerk poor in helping you out, as he had one foot out the door close to retirement. Was promised leads and got maybe one per month. Was forced to quit after nearly going broke, as cold calling in neighborhoods door to door was a pathetic way to make a living, let alone eat!"
bad,"Long shifts, with very poor holiday management, low pay, difficult to advance in company, poor communication, unfairly distributed workloads."
bad,"Sales/ call center job. Pays well but not worth your sanity. Talk to customers all day long and try and sell them a new alarm system or upgrade their current system. Most of the day is spent talking to very upset customers. Company does not care about employee's. They pretend to care about customers but after working there, you realize they could care less about the customers. All they want is their money. Majority of the companies customers want nothing to do with them but are locked into a 36 month agreement. Co-workers are awesome. They get you through your day. Most of the management is a joke. They have stat requirements you have to meet monthly/daily. If you do not meet them, you will be fired even if you do come to work everyday and do your job. I would never recommend working here."
bad,"I enjoyed getting up on a daily basis coming to work. I enjoyed my co-workers. My typical day at ADT was very stressful but I learned to navigate my day by always smiling. I've learned a lot from working at ADT. I learned the different technical issues of having an alarm the Pros and Cons of an alarm system. I learned how to deal with hostile customers and how to takeover the situation and not let the customer takeover the situation. I've learned to always put yourself in the customers situation as it was you. The most enjoyable moment is when I had a very irate customer and once we was ending the call he said to me ""Thank you Sabrina for helping me and I do apologize for yelling at you and that made my day because I calmed the customer and made the customer happy."
bad,Knock on strangers doors. Scare them into thinking they will be robbed. Sell them a security system. The End.
bad,They do not like people who are good at their position be promoted and worry more about the customers then employees
bad,"At the ADT facility in Irving, TX I have never witnessed a more ghetto, disorganized, unclean, and outright RATCHET place in all my days. I worked there for a year and in that year an entire HR crew was fired, the police were called there on several occasions, drug dogs frequently walk the parking lot sniffing vehicles, fights are a norm, unprofessionalism, people get drunk and high on 30 minute lunch breaks......management included, cleanliness was a word not utilized, I have watched this company double and triple charge their customers asinine amounts of money for deposits and monthly bills and they run from their responsibility, they will NOT acknowledge their wrongdoing, they mess up your pay checks and make you wait weeks to be reimbursed. The toughest part of this job was the people set in place to manage. The customers are great but ADT is a total scam. They don't tell you everything up front and will once again run from their mishap and refuse to take ownership. Managers run from escalated callers, countless amounts of transfers, and to top it off I worked 40 hours on my last pay period with a week of vacation pay that I did not use.... Gave them my two weeks notice, worked the two weeks and they sent me a check for 43.00 three months after I resigned. It hasn't surprised me that they will not take ownership as every time I call I'm told someone will call me back. Both my personal and family attorneys have been made aware and action will be taken even if it is for only $600. I will not tell them what they should be doing especially if they already know what they should"
bad,"Revolving door, pay is not enough for the work they expect from a person, treat people like robots."
bad,"Through my one year at ADT I found the pay was fair if they didn't take your money back if a customer cancelled in the first SIX months. Also the management lied about nearly everything. They did not care if you had appointments to make sales (the only way you make money) they would still force you to cancel for non-paid meetings in the office. "
bad,Hardest part of the job is getting the calls done in under 200 seconds. Interacting with my co-workers and the customers is my favorite part of the job
bad,Was at one time a great place to work but they changed their values after a merge. We were once Brinks who changed to Broadview Secuirty who was all about our customers.Those things changed after ther merge with ADT.I once loved my job and also had a great supervisor but after getting a new supervisor and a few other things I begin to not like my job and also felt that my supervisor wasn't there for me as much as she could've been like she was with other employees.
bad,es buena ya que era un buen ambiente solo que nos controlaban la hora de entrada y no la de salida siempre trabajaba una hora mas mínimo
bad,"Each Manager has their own way of doing business. A lot of cold calling, either door knocking homes/business, cold calling is required of past customers."
bad,"the pay is good, the organization is terrible! Forget about trying to have a life outside of work!"
bad,Attempt making contact with disconnected customers and make appointments with them and new customers. Keep appointments. Learned the product. Co-workers mostly keep to themselves. the hardest part was to make a sale. Most times we would be beaten by our own small businesses.
bad,ADT was a great company when I started then poor management took over. Loss so many people and managers. Mandatory OT every month or you’ll get fired. Incompetent team managers that don’t have a clue about the job. Director for our site is very uncaring. Back to back call volumes all the time. Rude and digusting customers the absolute worst and they want you to be sooooo nice and perky with the customers cursing you out. You should be happy all the time...all day long!!! Nobody is that happy!!! Favoritism rules in ADT. You’ll just see people being promoted and there was no jobs posting for the positions. They select their friends.
bad,"let go with not having a write up, watch over laptop cam using a e-cig and just holding my phone in my hand to see where I was going in company van. no second chances with this company"
bad,"Completely unprofessional, inpatient manager. Yelled and rudely criticized my mistakes. Demanding respect while not giving me respect. Don't work here"
bad,"The new metrics and expectations being implemented at ADT are completely out of the book. The company has come with so many different metrics in the last 3 years, that working for ADT has become very stressful and simply unfair for the Techs on the field. Management don't care about you, only about the numbers that the company wants. They want productivity, attainment, sell and the worst... something they call quality were they blame you for anything that happens at a customer site within 30 days of your service, it doesn't matter the reason that can cause the service order, even if it's not cause by the problem you went to fix, they force you to use refurbished parts for service repairs, which many of them fails again. It's completely out of your control and very unfair.   They don't care and  your are always at fault. They want 90% of quality, you to sell $600 in equipment, a productivity min of .90 jobs per hour ( average 6 service tickets per day), even to get time approved  to service the company's truck is a problem. Management sucks. Everything has changed with the Apollo and P1 acquisition of ADT. Micromanagement is the worst."
bad,the hardest part of the job was trying to learn different tasks at a face paced environment and there were various management doing different things. The team base environment was pretty straight forward on tasks for the day.
bad,"Very Difficult place to work, many calls from many unhappy customers. Management hardly ever sticks up for their employees and push back on policy change is not looked at for any reason"
bad,adt was great at first but unless ur buddy buddy with the managers ur not moving up. they hired new people in making 1$ more than you with no experience. just a horrible place to work!!!!
bad,"I was a temp at ADT for 7 months and absolutely hated it! There was clear favoritism between me and one other coworker. We had the same job, but I did all the work. She would bs all day with the managers, talking about personal life. I was constantly ""talked to"" about things I needed to do differently, while my coworker was never. Even though I constantly corrected her on the processes I was directed to do... the management was horrible. Didn't feel comfortable talking to management. Once I went to a ""leader"" in confidence and immediately regretted it. Would never recommend them to anyone."
bad,"All about numbers.  Middle management is a joke.  Policy changes every month.  Slide show training, but write ups for quality issues.  Cover your A**!"
bad,"I loved working for ADT in Colorado. Once I transferred to one of their centers in Texas, it was like a completely different company. Management positions seemed to be handed to anyone whether they were qualified or not. They throw their employees to the wolves. every one on one with management is negative and discouraging. In Colorado, the company culture was outstanding. The environment was clean, warm, and welcoming. Managers knew answers to questions and if they did not they would find out for the team."
bad,"Overall the company is headed in the complete wrong direction. It is no longer competitive in its market and the only reason for its continued survival is the fact they were the only known security company for a very long time. Now that, that is no longer the case, the company is bleeding money and customers at a rapid pace. And this is reflected in the work place. Management is laughable and the company is very unethical (to employees and customers) to say the least. I would not recommend working here. It appears good from the out look, but most people end up hating this place."
bad,"Having been in sales before, I know the sales process. I understand that anyone can get better, but I had zero product training. To sell a product, one must get the knowledge about the product."
bad,"I was promised a stable work environment but that promise faded over time."
bad,Bad organization skills for the entire system. There parts inventory is always backlogged do to ordering when they need it and not have a stock before. There is constant disagreements between the sales and installation over simple things such as paperwork which could be fixed by ether side. Instead the customer has to suffer by getting delayed and rescheduled. I have worked for may Large corporation and this has been the most ineffective on I have ever worked for. If it wasn't for them outsourcing most of there work ADT would have been in the history books along time ago.
bad,"Lack of management, facilities were so dirty that OSHA was actually contacted before the company took steps to clean up the facility, making it a safer place to work."
bad,"Go in early, get home late. Ask for help, you likely won't receive what you need. Very stressful and hard to balance work life with family life due to late work hours. Time card is time consuming and expected to be completed outside of work hours. Job is great and what I would like to do, but do not want to work for this company."
bad,I have worked for this company for almost 2 years. I dread going into work every single day. I am not happy there and it's the worst job I've had and probably will ever have in my life. Very stressful just sitting at a cubicle 7 hours a day
bad,"I learned how to process data changes received via mail, phone or internal ticket. i also learned support false changes received and damage claims and provide support for other data cleanup projects."
bad,"poor management,pay was to be expected.Indeed requires far to much information."
bad,"ADT have the highest rotation of sales persons in their area. It's a numbers game. Some will make it, some will fail, If you don't have a strong networking group better look for another job."
bad,"too many chiefs and not enough indians! More focused on personal gain rather then team spirit and get it done attitude! Motto is ""COVER YOUR BUTT! They would rather lose an account then service it properly."
bad,"Very stressful and confusing because everyday you are told to different things compared to a day before.I've learn in order to be on top you have you to work hard and be able to handle customers in every angle.As for Management you don't get any assistance and at the end of the day/month you have to produce the results.I,m working with a good team people who always strive to make target,team players and very strong Credit controllers.Is to deal with client who has a problem and you as a Credit controller you can't make a final decision only your manager or a manager from the different dep and you don't get any assistants then i get discouraged.Is when i archieve my monthly target and solving a client qeury or helping one of my collegue who were strugling to resolve an account."
bad,"ADT is the worst company that I have ever worked for. Prior to the merge when it was Brinks/Broadview I would still be their today and Customer service really meant that you do want you need to do to take care of the customer. Now its all about money and how much we can save and then waste on stupid things like $80,000 for new grass really. The top corprate guys get the 6 figure bouneses while everyone else cant get a raise till apirl yet reviews where done in nov and the raise should have been efft. in Jan. You get lied to about everything and its not because of the management at the center but the people that are above them. Job was very easy but it was so stress full that you go home mad and upset every night. only hing enjoyable about the job is going to see your piers. If you do you dont claim your kids on your taxes start looking for insuarnce for them if you end up taking the job cause they will not be covered."
bad,Stressful fast pace because everyone calls off because no one actually likes it here things are always changing with no training to prepare for the changes managers only care to cover them  sometimes mangers don't even greet you it's alot here
bad,"I have been there for 9 months, we were poorly trained for what the job actually entails. The company allows the customers to speak to you in any fashion they deem appropriate. Agents are not able to ask the customers to refrain from cursing nor to keep the call professional. The stats are almost impossible to hit consistently. You can be a overall 5 star agent but still be written up for 1 low stat."
bad,"I have never quit a job in my life until I had The Misfortune of working at ADT."
bad,"C'est juste pour le salaire,  ne pas conseiller/harcèlement  psychologique/"
bad,"I was told we're suppose to be like family and help each other out. But I had sales stolen. Ridiculed from a veteran employee who eventually stole a commission sale. Manager did not properly coach how to sell security, but instead talked about sales and added daily pressure without helping with a solution. HR and district HR overlooked theft and bias in the workplace."
bad,"Nice people, no pay. Commission only pay, cold leads, required useless cold calling. A lot of traveling for no reason, having to drive three hours to meet with a customer to just give an over priced quote then get no sale."
bad,"The job was alright. The customers were a little difficult but that's anywhere. Management was lacking in knowledge, constant policy changes made it hard to keep up, and when changes took place, employees were not notified. Wanting to go above and beyond for the customer often resulted in being disciplined by your manager."
bad,From 2002 to 2009 was a great company to work for but once changes started new management  pay drop it went down hill need to start caring more about employees
bad,"A typical day of work was fine, I appreciated how motivating the team was. I learned a lot about myself. Now, the management is extremely upsetting. Multiple times the company has stolen from me and others. One of the managers tried to engage relations with me innapropiately. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,like i said before management doesn't care the only thing they care about is money. they smoked weed on the job and didn't care for homeowners.
bad,"The only and i mean only good thing about this place is the benefits. Management sucks, very unprofessional, very disorganized, will put you in hot water just to save there job. Treat the best techs like you are worthless. Management does not care about your personal life so if you work here i can promise you wont have one. Will take the customer side just so they won't lose money even if it means letting a tech go."
bad,"Commission Only, No Training, Poor Mangement & Low Travel Reimbursement."
bad,"I was at ADT for a couple weeks shy of 7 years. I stayed there in hopes of being promoted but was ""put off"" for 7 years. I applied to be a receptionist but was hired as a customer service rep. I asked about my promotion every year was told I qualify for any other position but I never got the job. I got many raises but never a supervisor position. Just before I quit, the company was under investigation because there were no minorities in a supervisor or leadership position. It is also a HUGE HASSLE getting ADT to give a direct number or free way of confirming ones employment. Supervisors do not like taking phone calls and will give customers the run around."
bad,"Not a fair environment. The manager does not allow any one to speak during meetings. If contractor, manager keeps blackmailing that you could fired. Treat contractors very bad"
bad,Must be able to be a technician and a salesman with a quota of sales you must meet. They are thinking only to hire salespeople and train them to be technicians.
bad,"Gain experience in a call centre, no possibility of advancement, favoritism rather than promoting hard working qualified employees."
bad,Door to door sales
bad,"My manager was great  but the install managers at ADT are worthless  they don’t communicate at all and could care less if your installs go in, that’s when you get paid."
bad,"It was not rewarding at all and very unprofessional."
bad,So many recent changes and the working environment became very histile and unprofessional how they handled things and privded information to us. the customers were always unaware of new changes. & the employees were never a concern nor will you ever be put first they only care about the customers not the employees
bad,ADT in the DFW area treat us like mess.They always tracking you wont let you do your job you get a pat on the back for doing a good job.. I had been with ADT for almost 20 yrs and when they did that merge with P1 it just went downhill from there.  Use to be a fun place to work but not anymore.
bad,Great company to work for.. Company has gotten really large with customers and not enough employees. Adt has been around for 140 years.
bad,"I knew I did not want to work for ADT when I learned that their parent company TYCO was buying my company in January of 2010.  I started looking for a job and found a competitor that I am much happier working for.  The office environment at the corporate branch in Pleasanton was terrible.  They make you work like dogs, making you do an ineffective call night every Tuesday night when you should be home with your family.  I think ADT dealers are the scourge of the industry.  ADT is not focused on the customer experience, only the bottom line.  If ADT was the only security company to work for, I would find something else to do."
bad,"Great position for meeting new people however, if yo don't sale you don't earn an income."
bad,"Desvinculacion a mansalva , mienten que es plazo indeterminado.,"
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyoneBecause of how the commission is set up if you don’t make any sales you don’t get paid I would be working 80 hour weeks and wouldn’t get paid
bad,"Managerial staff very un-professional, job very stressful as it's inconsistent, no support from management....very high turn over.  Company do have great activities and contest monthly."
bad,"Although very successful financially for the aggressive sales professional, the organization lacked a strategic or sensible plan for the stabilization of a career oriented employee."
bad,"I enjoy work that has challenges and has growth potential, I have found that working with goal oriented people gives me the drive a need to success and do better. I apply myself to everything I do and find problem solving to be one of my best abilities."
bad,"Have gained valuable experience working here, and achieved a lot however as an organisation- It's culture, people development, employee loyalty, customer centricity and ethics are poor which is sad for a world leading brand"
bad,"After two weeks of leaving the place, my wife looked at me and said at last Ive got my husband back (mentally). Get accused of wrong doings and those who constantly annoy customers are thought of quite highly."
bad,"Managers  are dishonest and have their favorites. You have to work stats,  raises are very minimal I would give the place a 0 if I could. "
bad,if you are lazy you get promoted to lead or management. while hard working people never have room for promotion . the whole moral of the adt distribution is low. management flirting with employees. human resource on site is going clubbing with employees ..place is a joke
bad,"Much like any sales position, the experience you have comes from the effort you put into the position. Overall, I would suggest that most people don't look into this position."
bad,Challenging job as you have to work many hours and try to accumulate sales from customers. Unfortunately there was little support from the office manager at the time of my employment
bad,"Very demanding, would not recomened, they dont treat customer well, not trained well, no room for growth and the pay is not that good. They arenot as strict a they should."
bad,"I was told a salary plus commission,  after a week i was then told it was actually a draw vs commission every month  No car allowance,  couldnt get a new leads sheet unless i jumped through hoops"
bad,"Bad idea to speak ill of a previous employer in this situation.  Place was not clean. Chairs had urine stains because pressure to stay on the phone was so great.  Chairs were sterilized, not cleaned.  Training not sufficient.  Best part of the job was that I really liked the people I worked with."
bad,Lots of angry customers on a daily basis.Managers changed very frequently.Not a relaxed place at all.But for the type of job it was the pay was good and the training.
bad,"I was giving very little training.  Asked to go to clients house and access their security system. I would then call my manager and we would try to fix it over the phone.  Most of the time, I would just set up a tech to come out.  I would then try to convenience home owners to sign leases for equipment that was not working yet."
bad,it is a nice environment that has a lot of learning experiences. The managers were helpful and the job was straight forward for the most part and to help customers with alarms was great
bad,"too many cold calls, managers were jerks...long long hours and no sales. was a high stress environment and no off days at all...worst job that i ever worked at."
bad,Sales are only comission and the management team is very unfair. it frustrates new employees because they favor the older employees rather than focusing in the new ones learning path.
bad,"very money driven"
bad,"Work on the floor was not what i expected. You have to share desks, and you work other departments than what you were hired for.  There are phone stats that you have to follow, and if you are stuck on the phone past your break time that is assigned you do not get a break. If you take that break from your scheduled break time, it will count against you. I did not enjoy working for this company."
bad,But not that office 25 year techs get made to feel like they are easily replaced. Very poor leadership can not ask questions on how to improve numbers  you are told to call other techs. Cooperate will come in saying the rf sensors all need to be tested than managers will tell you we don't have time but u will hear about it if they start falsing everything is the techs fault I got yelled at over a go back that j sold them 400 worth of stuff but they needed to wait  a week to do it till checks had came in. After being trained for two months they told me my numbers had to be better than the 20 year techs I'm possible I would try another office. Not a happy home techs always talking about leaving.
bad,Don't work there!  We weren't given the tools needed to do our job and the company was very unorganized.  AE's spent more time filling out paperwork than working on sales.
bad,"Commission based with a very small portion of company leads. Salesforce software used to generate your own leads."
bad,"Entry-level jobs are filled on personality and fit, which makes your coworkers unique and inspiring. Indeed's Training and Development team can (and will) teach you what you need to know to perform the job, but you have to bring personality and drive everyday to be great at it."
bad,I was on a 6 week assignment.  I found that the onboarding process leaves little to be desired.  It took over a week to get me a computer and office supplies.
bad,"bad, bad, bad everything was bad, the salary on commissioned based was horrible, the managers were horrible. the way they talked their employers was very bad."
bad,"While working for ADT prior to the merger with Tyco the company was a great place to work. The general manager was a part of  management as well as persons in the field.  There were Christmas parties with dinner, dancing, raffles and prizes. There were summer BBQs for the entire family.  The healthcare benefits were great.  The company matched the funds dollar per dollar into the 401K's. "
bad,"I would not give it one star if I was able. They make employees come in to work even if they are very sick (like 103 fever) if you do not have sick days left, they do not except Dr.'s notes or even a note from the ER, (you can just go there to get that note for a day off any time you want-is their thought) You have to keep compliance so you only get an extra 12 minutes all day to be away from your desk besides your standard 2 breaks and 30min lunch, this includes any bathroom breaks, logging in to your phone a little late from any break or lunch or any need to be away from your desk, I am a non-smoker so it doesn't effect me, the company is going completely non-smoking soon, employees will not even be allowed to smoke in their cars on company property. They give vacation, but only a little at a time, so you may have 3 weeks but you can't take it all because you won't have it until the end of the year, and forget about being paid any unused vacation if you leave, Leaving the company is reward enough!"
bad,adt is a ok job to work at. It was not the place for me. Its just a job not a career the company is very cheap and does not want to give raises
bad,"no room for advancement, pace was very stagnant and culture was non existent"
bad,Base pay along with commission would benefit the companies high turnover rate.
bad,My job provided me with valuable experience and has exposed me to numerous aspects of thinking and viewing things.I am now comfortable working with different people from different walk of life.I am action orientated and have the ability to multi-task.
bad,"Receive customer calls, check payments, outstanding invoices."
bad,The company has a high turnover rate due to a lot of misinformation being provided.
bad,"I love my co-workers, however, I feel like ADT needs alot of work from management on up. The management is horrible!"
bad,"It's door to door sales if you don't make any sales you don't get paid. Work starts at 11 am and you might not get home until 9 or 10, six days a week. The money is great if you make sales."
bad,"AWFUL-no ability to help the customers on nights.  All other departments cold transfer the customers they do not want to deal with into your queue.  "
bad,i did love my job just hated the attendence policy in 90 days i got fired because i was on bed rest and had a doctors note from the hospital and i wasnt out of my 90 days so they let me go
bad,This is a commission only job if you live in southern Ky you will drive in excess of 3000 miles a month   There are so many variables of a customer can have service it’s just not a stable life
bad,"This is an environment that doesn't breed success. Managers aren't trustworthy and will cover for one another. There is a great deal of favoritism based on who receive company leads. The training is great, as well as their products. The culture of the company is bottom line profit, micromanagement, low office engagement, poor management and leadership, which leads to unethical behavior by management. The actions of some managers are ignored because this corporate office is located in Florida. The corporate office relies on information from the managers at the local level. There are some good managers, however, the ones that lack people skills and are dishonest deserve this review."
bad,Horrible repor with employees. Never addressed concerns of employees. Take it or leave it way conducting business with employees. No knowledge and education advancement within company.
bad,As with all Jobs they are what you make them to be. I found that I had an excellent relationship with all my direct reports. I also met many nice co-workers. Sadly I just found that they have a low appreciation for people exceeding goals. This probably has more to do with ADT being a power house organization and its my fault to ever assume that exceeding goals could be noticed in an organization that large.
bad,"Avoid working for this company. Make it a less option should you need income. Poor management team from head quarters. Team leads were not helpful but very judgemental. Leadership skills missing especially in the area of communication."
bad,ADT is a great company if you are looking for home security but as far as working here I would not recommend it at all . My anxiety have worsen throughout my career with ADT . Very stressful for sure!
bad,"Starting with this - Once a account is sold and Started your still at risk for losing your full commissions for up to 6 MONTHS!! They want you to babysit every account for 6 Months"
bad,If you're single young with no family this is a great starter job but for an adult with a family it leaves no time for them due to the pay to make ends meet you'll need to do a lot of overtime Getting time off is hard get If a true emergency comes up your penalized with points for calling out with or without a note
bad,"ADT Was Just Definitely My Most Disappointed Selling Positions Where Held In 20 Years.  The Pay Is Strictly Commission,  Door To Door Sales Hot, Rain Or Cold.  Barely Took Lunch Break At Lunch Time. And Worst Of All... They Cheat You Of Your Deals And Pay."
bad,This is a call center and they are pretty much the same. This one seems to be out for you and turnaround is horrible. I was told I didn't get a position I applied for because I didn't know the managers. How many jobs did you work and knew the manager.
bad,"fun environment for work. "
bad,"While working as a dispatcher for ADT there was no interest in having me trouble shoot issues over the phone that could have lessoned the amount of actual required service visits, they only wanted to get appointments booked, charges confirmed, and the customer off the phone as quickly as possible."
bad,ADT employees are extremely hard workers. They are always positive and upbeat and treat each other like family.
bad,"Sold a bill of goods to take the job...they said quick career advancement, a lot of opportunities. Place was run like a sweat shop. Advancement opportunities in customer service slim to none."
bad,I felt like a monkey with a license you can’t be a good worker when you don’t get the pay you should they are in just for the company not the workers and some day when all the workers leave they will wonder why
bad,"I'm part of the collections team & out of 160 or more collectors, I'm top 10 & no recognition for that at all!  Plus i only get paid 11.50 for the services I do"
bad,"Management treats you like a child you  have to ask for permission to do anyrhing , not enough work to get 40 hours . They send you home because the management doesnt know how to keep work flowing or route techs in an area where they can complete multiple jobs. Techs act like its high school , to much negativity to enjoy working, favortism for some employees who cant do wrong . Stay away from this place if you need money to survive."
bad,Bad place to work - no salary - straight commission - company will not live up to their promises on qualified leads !!!!!!!!!!! Car allowance is set way too low ect.
bad,"I loved ADT at first. Then they threaten you every month. Your scared you will not have a job month to month. You work long days 6 days a week. Work life balance is not good.  It is a toxic work environment.  You cannot work well when you fear of losing your job all the time.  Threats,  threats,  threats. Very stressful. Always wants to add one more thing to your plate to go do when you have enough to do as it is. If you can't get self generated leads DO NOT APPLY  you won't have a job long."
bad,"It was a transitional time when i left. not sure how it is now. The management was rocky when i was leaving, transportation became difficult once i moved"
bad,"I had heard that I was too old and too slow. After achieving the Top Installer for 10yrs. I accomplised everything that i was aske too do, was selected to perform the difficult task that not all other techs could not perform"
bad,"no sell no pay at all "
bad,"NO growth, call centers are like high school. Keep your head down and do your shift. 30 min breaks which makes it impossible to eat off site. Weekends and crazy late hours are required."
bad,"Unfortunately no training whatsoever. Thank god i have a background in payroll or else i would have been complexly lost. I was hired for a transition that was for a length of 6 months. For over 13,000 employees we had 4 people processing payroll. Although i do not mind hard work needless to say i was working quite a bit of hour and my quality of life was diminished."
bad,"I only worked under one good manager, all the rest were selfish and self-serving."
bad,"I was hired for a CSG agent, I was told I would be getting trained for 6 weeks with hands on training. They cram all the information in your head in 8 hours, you're not allowed to study the materials, then you get quizzed. If you make below an 80 on these quizzes, you first get a verbal, then a written, then your fired. You have resources to use, depending on who your trainer is you may or may not grasp the way things are being described. They lead you to believe they are fighting for you and getting you the help you need as far as the quizzes go. The few weeks I was mentored on the phones, the mentors were amazing, they made sure you got it. My customers were happy, my call stats didn't look bad for being on my 3rd week in the phones. We took a quiz the previous day I failed it, I am learning the material for the day, they tell us we will be learning Edo that day. While I'm listening in my trainer pulls me into HR and I'm fired. I don't get to say anything, there were no documents to sign, nothing. The company has the potential to be great if they actually held true to what they tell people during the interview and training process."
bad,"Good pay, some good people but going through changes. cafeteria is great. long hours no work life balance. typical corporate company suits required. not exciting"
bad,they hire you and lie to you right off the go.   they say you are your own boss than they change your pay change your job and never tell you they make you work long hours everyday and don't want to pay you for them
bad,"You wake up to look at your schedule for the day and you find two or three leads in you box that the phone sale time already worked and quoted a price. When you get to the customer's house you are in for a battle of he said she said on the phone. The customer is given one price on the phone and the outside sales reps have to use the book price which is much higher than the inside phone sales price. In other words, we are competing against each other and the company does not care that the customer's are caught in the middle. I have learned that when a company goes public and has to answer to stock holders, that business is in trouble. As for management, they are just following orders like puppets in order to keep their jobs. My co-workers were great. I enjoyed seeing them in the office and talking to them on the phone.The hardest part of this job was having to listen to management tell us day in and day out the lies about our position at this company. This company is trying to reduce the field sales reps so they give us garbage as leads to force us to do what they want us to do either self generate or resale generate our appointments. The most enjoyable part of this job was before all of this foolishness started, sales reps were able to make an excellent living and they took it away."
bad,My personal belief that they let the coworkers act out and their is no relief to breathe and be effective at your job. there is a large population of very young people who run rampart at night when the managers leave the one or two managers that stay till ten join in on the fun.  the cross talk is very bad when you are trying to be on a call
bad,"Very poorly managed company, Management does not listen to the service or installers.  Trucks are poorly stocked to do the job at hand.  Poor training on new products released,  avoid this company at all costs as an employee and customer."
bad,"The company have potential to be great, the lack of leadership and training made it really hard to really understand the culture of the company, i was there for a few months before getting retrenched and had to learn everything on my own. it was a challenge but i got the hang of it, but not really a fun and friendly environment."
bad,"be prepared to knock on every door in town and call every person in the phone book. lots and lots of prospecting. hardly any selling, other companies are offering the same products cheaper"
bad,encourage pas lest vrai bon vendeur qui peuve faire une différence il veule te contrôle dans tous les aspect de la ventes.
bad,The sales manager was an alcoholic that would come in hungover and berated people that did not give the answer he wanted. He was sent to sensitivity training twice in the short time I was there. When I started I was given a timeline as to how long training would take because I could not sell until it was complete. It took a month longer because manager failed to sign me up for the class despite daily reminders. The systems were easy to learn and most of my co-workers were nice and helpful. But I should have seen the writing on the wall as every week more and more people would quit citing our sales mgr as the reason.
bad,"A company that doesn't seem to have a clue, I'm still wondering how they got as big as they are.  I sold a job, installation messed it up, then billing billed it wrong - consistently.  Nobody I worked with cared at all about the customer, it was stunning really.  They claim they are ""customer obesessed"",  I never saw anything like that. This is why I resigned, I was expected to sell a service and a company that I simply couldn't believe in.  They'd take the customer's money, after that the customer did not exist for them."
bad,"You are paid 100% commission and if your lucky (or unlucky like me), you will have very few other reps in your area. Leads are very low and it won't help having multiple reps in one area. I'm always looking for a new job."
bad,"I knock in at 8;30, I make myself tea and I load my gazebo or take my promotion kit. while i am waiting for a driver because he gets in @ 9;00 I wait outside with my colleagues asking my manager about yesterdays leads, on how did they respond, did they sign contracts or what.   then, i go to the promotion until I knock off @ 4;30. the management is friendly as well as my colleagues. the hardest part is where by you need to go to the gazebo while is so windy and where by you need to convince a client to take a bigger alarm. the most enjoyable part,   (smile) its where by the big boss is not in......(hides((((, but most of the time its nice whether he is in or not except the fact that they are not paying"
bad,"so fue muy buena la experienza ya que solamente teniamos que trabajar en neuquen y terminabamos trabajando en roca,"
bad,"I gained valuable experience and insight during my time with ADT. My coworkers became assets to my development from a technical stand point, as well as a resource for personal development as an employee."
bad,"I am not happy with working with this employer as "
bad,"If your looking for a job that will challenge you, make you feel good about your self then don’t look to ADT.  If you have half a brain you can do this job in your sleep.  To say I was bored out of my mind is an understatement.  It’s the same calls over and over again; “My Bill is wrong!”  “My keypad says I have a low battery, what do I do?”  “Why did my alarm go off at 3am?”  That’s about it.  Mangers don’t know how to give positive feedback on anything you do. Oh, and be ready to to work overtime.  It’s REQUIRED!!"
bad,Very political environment divided by employees vs contractors. Contractors are not invited to meetings with the business stakeholders but expected to know what transpired. Micromanaged at the daily task level with no communication or guidance from management.  Projects all run differently with focus on the least important details. Other contractors seen as competition so there is no team cooperation/communication.
bad,Was hired by protection one who was being converted to ADT the job was not worth you baby sit cry baby tech on the phone who are to lazy to do there job
bad,To much driving not enough sales have to be a good liar not a good job for me. Too many people selling home security also there's too many do-it-yourself packages no one wants to buy it unless you're pretty much force it on them
bad,"It was awful working there. I didn’t feel secure there. I asked for help, and never received it. I had to go door to door for outdoor sales, and it is a joke. People slam doors in your face, people threw things at my car. I had to drive in horrible weather conditions, and our managers didn’t care. I was laid off for asking help, and wanting to grow basically, because in their eyes I wasn’t trying. I was out in the drinks from 2:00 PM to almost 10:00PM every  night.Overall, don’t work there."
bad,Came to adt with no experience and they knew it didn't offer proper training didn't give lot of time for training and expected you to do the job after a week of going out with someone. Management sucked didn't really care for employees.
bad,"This is a fast paced environment and you have to take at least 118 calls per day.  There is nothing professional about the atmosphere here at all.  The managers some are okay, others you just have to be careful."
bad,A moribund organisation where it is rare to find anyone from any department happy to be working for ADT. The sales environment is both oppressive and feral.
bad,"Go in do what you have to do and go out. Its really hard to move up within the company, its easier to quit and reapply for management. Its all about politics."
bad,"A Typical day working at ADT would be very stressful, getting yelled at 85% of the time by customers due to failed systems, failed jobs done by ADT or a authorized dealer or something not being complete by ADT. I learned how to handle more upset customers and how critical time can be. Management were very unorganized, but ""fun"".The workplace is very strict, no smoking, no going off the premise on your 15 min breaks. The hardest part of working at ADT would be handling a call and using all the tools provided to you to complete your job correctly and those tools are not correct themselves."
bad,"Very Stressful work atmosphere, lots of micro managing, THIS IS A SELF GENERATING JOB, managers will not allow you to leave dept if you are making them look good. Stay away if you want a peace of mind and your sanity. Very high pressured Job!"
bad,"the work was fine, some coworkers in the call center were honest but many others were not..you were provided a headset and if you left it on your workstation for a break or restroom visit - it would be stolen by the time you returned, you had to buy the next one, they are $50 - bought 2 in one year.  This is not a concern of management"
bad,Starting with no salary then having to make hundreds of sales request telephone calls each day that produce very few sales is demoralizing. The price for a sale could be much more competitive.
bad,ADT was not for me.  I have nothing to say about ADT.  I was cold calling or sometimes at a trade show.  Mostly cold calling which I was not told about.
bad,"It wasn't a very good fit for me, and had a pretty high turnover rate in general. The management lacked empathy and communication skills. My coworkers were pretty awesome, but that didn't make up for the stress that the job piled up in my life."
bad,"Not the best place to work when you relocate to a new state and trying to get  things setup. company need to have better training structure, Managers need to be more personal and detailed with new hires."
bad,The actual job description is misleading compared to the actual daily expectation. The culture is not reflective of racial harmony. Rather that underline bias
bad,A typical day was to cold call and make home visits to gain sales.  Unusual hours were demanded and many times customers with scheduled appointments were either extremely late for the appointment or didn't show up at all.
bad,Could have had better management and guidelines. Overall some the employees were great to work with and a team but management and could have been better.
bad,"After working as an installer for 20 plus year this has been the time we employees have been under appreciated the most. This new mentality of the new CEO is the type that "" if you don't like what you see then leave"". Management is under constant changes and pressure the techs to up sale, work their days off, install inferior cheap new systems and when it doesn't work we the techs are the blame. Daily emails are sent with discrepancies of our daily routine.  I thought I would retire from this company but I am  seriously considering to leave and start again. It used to be a happy great place to wake up and see your future get ahead. I feel for the new guys."
bad,I only worked there for a short period of time but my sales compensation plan changed many times and never for the better. I did have a good sales manager but he left with all the changes.
bad,This place is a joke. No management displine and commission only where others are paying at least a base salary. Run away from this.
bad,"For a company that deals with emergency situations you would think they would make an effort to retain quality personnel. However they seem to like the high turnover rate to justify near fast food wages while expecting 911 call center quality. "
bad,This was a job that was not quite what I had come to expect however for a short period of time it was a job that worked out for me.
bad,"This company could care less about their employees.  It's all about numbers and it doesn't matter how they get there.  Including, stealing assigned clients from one sales person and giving them to another.  Also, mandatory Saturday's.  No work/life balance.  Even text message at 3 a.m.  I wouldn't recommend this employer to anyone."
bad,The pay isn't well and the demands and expectation that the job  requires is over whelming. The pay is terrible just not a place I feel like you can advance in.
bad,"a lot of cold calling and door knocking, more for a hunter mentality than a customer service mentality. They talked one company philosophy but practiced the opposite. Talked customer service all the time but was about making the sale at any cost and no follow up"
bad,"There are far better jobs than ADT.  Looked so promising, but when selling the high dollar latest technology, ADT was not capable of installing on it sooner than 45 days on average in the Baton Rouge market.  They wanted lots of cheap $99 installs, because they are more interested in getting the monitoring fees as quickly as possible.  In order to be successful you have to sell more expensive systems.  Had they been honest with me and told me 45 days (instead of the 1 week lead time they quoted) I never would have taken the job."
bad,"Being young, it was fairly hard to do door to door sales. And I did not like at all my entire pay being based off of my sales.  I would much rather have a steady income."
bad,"Unfortunately, this company has been used and abused by investors by which I mean management seems to not really care about the employees but creating numbers for investors. ADT now sells an average product for a inflated price relying on Brand name recognition to sell the product. Very poor morale, offices and call center haven't been updated for years. Poor customer service after the sale."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Worked as a sales rep and there was a manager who took away agent money for no reason. This was not a way to live. This individual destroyed the way of life for many folks. Folks could not pay their rent/mortgages, buy food, pay car notes or take care of their family. Poor management let her get away with it."
bad,Not a very employee friendly place to work. Job consisted of very long hours with inconsistancy in pay.
bad,"If you can sit tight and do your own thing, this is right for you. If you have any sense, don't fall for the misleading information that continually comes down from the sales managers. If lying works, this is perfect. If you want commission only, this is it. Company appointments are a joke. This company is going to Self Generated appointments and even the pay there is limited. The company believes having a competing dealer network and a national sales force is a good idea. I saw no good in that and it often created confusion with customers and distrust. Salesforce was rolled out to salesforce, but it is nothing more than a tracking device for management to see what you are doing. They still insist on having call night once a week and making over 75 cold calls per day. So much information is left out of interview and the training is well, limited."
bad,"massive calls, horriable management from top to bottom, rotating door, new employee every months."
bad,"Just like with all call centers, you are specifically trained to deal with one main objective. With ADT I was with the FSC (field support) however over half way through my first year there, they informed us that we would be taking on some of the billing calls due to short staffing and that it should only last a week or two. Thats where the lie began, for one we received NO training or info on how to troubleshoot the security system or handle billing questions or payments. They literally said ""you'll figure it out then more calls you take"" So of course there were tons of inaccurate info given and failed payments which resulted in deactivation of services. This wen on for over two months before I had enough and quit. The supervisors helped as much as they were allowed to, but in the end they couldnt help us with what they also knew nothing about."
bad,"I watched them fire 2 employees that were there over 30 years and not blink an eye, then they fired me after almost 16 yrs. I made this company Millions and Millions of dollars, I saved many angry customers, and trained many employees for FREE! They don’t care about their employees or The CUSTOMER. And it’s getting worse! Your job is on the line every day."
bad,Good experience from work place and also management level. I learned lot of things from them. But commission based job so demotivated to employees to continue to work for longer.
bad,I use to work from 7 am to 16hoo there and got to learn that not all jobs there was plesand as there was lots of new sales reps coming and going all the time
bad,"Low Pay, People who are new is making more than me. The raises are low and they have a high turn over rate. Also, the training is horrible and they do a horrible job of notifying their workers of nany changes."
bad,I don't think it's worth the money you get for your time and skills. I was told during my interview that I was going to be able to work part-time hours but once I was on the floor they changed their mind.
bad,"in the span of my last year, I went from having a career year to needing to take out a loan to make it through the rest of the year. The management was absolutely horrific, to the point none of them are there as of this post. Nothing and I mean nothing was ever good enough"
bad,"ADT is a very stressful fast paced job.  You had to have 98% adherence each day. They expect you to give great customer service to the customers, but when troubleshooting certain things or trying to talk an elderly person through a system which should not have been sold to them in the first place can make those calls from 15 minutes to two hours based on the procedures ADT wants their reps to follow."
bad,"I enjoyed working as a Collections Agent, But as time went on things with the company started to go down hill very fast, They were writing people up for their stats even for not collecting a lot of money for their monthly goal, Also when it comes time for the company to payout their agents for their quarterly bonuses they try to find every little thing to penalize or even FIRE the agent just so they don't have to pay them their money. The supervisors would only be fair to their favorite agents that they get along with, The pay wasn't so great at all I worked as a Collections Agent I during the day and my pay was only $12.50 and when I worked the night shift it was only $13.27."
bad,If you want to work for ADT and have a life that is not possible. They are so low staffed they need you to work overtime to fill up the fact that they haven't hired enough people to do the job. When they do hire  class it quits before they hit the floor. The stress level of the employees is so bad they are already looking for new employment. When you change the work life and require more work with no pay changes it make the job 100% harder.
bad,After the buy of adt the company has gone down hill every week they change the rules almost daily the managers don't know what they are doing in Cincinnati oh you have to be a friend or family to be recognized
bad,"But I work for ADT Home Security it was more of a call center for selling home security systems. A typical day was we were making outbound calls to people and different areas around the world selling home security systems. Management was really just watching us as we took calls and making sure that they can handle a call if it got out of hand. The workplace culture was slow and fast at times. We will have fun activities to do, potlucks, little games here and there. The hardest part of my job was not getting enough hours and not knowing if we were getting paid or not. Sometimes they will come to us and tell us that we will have to wait till the following week to get paid instead of when we were supposed to get paid. The most enjoyable part of working there was just interacting with other people from all over the world. To learn people different situations and why they would need a security system will make it more comfortable of why you're doing what we do."
bad,"Ambiance glaciale aux bureaux...  La culture d'entreprise est inexistante: toute prise de décision se fait aux Etats-Unis... Les clients sont des numéros (les employés aussi)!"
bad,Company is very difficult to work for. The compensation is bad and it’s a revolving door of sales people. Too many meetings and unrealistic quotas leave people feeling disenfranchised
bad,"The work schedule is different every day as is the job location. Customer service is the focus of the position. Some days start early and end late. There is little regard for the technicians life outside of working for the company. Other responsibilities and obligations don't matter so long as more jobs are completed. Management at various levels can be difficult to work with, if not oppressive. The workplace culture places money above all else. If a quick buck can be made then it is justified and it doesn't matter the sacrifice. Despite this, there are some positives. Wages for the work performed are good and employees are given a fair amount of autonomy as the job requires constant travel."
bad,"this job taught me how to work under stress for sure.  Years ago, it was a great place to work.  Now managers make it unbearable and definitely not a fair playing field.. Reps that have been there are now experiencing a drop in pay as much as 20k per year."
bad,"Most work days are very stressful and long hours.  All I my experience was mostly hands-on and taking the time myself to learn about what was needed.  Management just does what they are told by their higher up piers instead of sticking up for the guys who work under them (field techs). This company does have available room for advancement if you know the right people.  The company is so focused on customers, that it forgets about the people (field techs) who make the company what it is today.  If you work out in the field as a technician, forget about family time or anything else important to you.  This company does not care about what time you need to be off for events with your son, daughter or wife, so better plan accordingly to take time off and use up your accumulated leave.  "
bad,"Too many managers doing nothing but riding the technicians about one thing or another. I learned that if I wanted to grow this was not the place to do so. The best part of the job was always customer facing. The worst is constantly being watched by someone for something, whether you're taking too long picking up equipment or you're driving your truck too fast."
bad,"If you need a job, get ready for back to back calls, working weekends at first, and being thrown into your position with insufficient training. You will share a desk and there are alot of young unprofessional people there."
bad,"This was just something to do at the time until I found better job.  I had to go into peoples homes and when I sold a system, the pay at the time wasn't good.  I left for a better opportunity."
bad,At first being hired to work MMB accounts which are account directly through ADT and beging being trained on all account types in a short amount of time and no increase in pay.
bad,"ADT management was poor, ability to move up was non existent.  Managers would encourage you to advance but then give you no path to get there.  Pay was bad, customers were rude and technology isn't  that great."
bad,"The outside sales position can be challenging because we compete against authorized dealers and internal phone sales departments that have more price flexibility and promotions to offer the customers than we do.  The compensation plan is not that competitive.  Some of the sales managers are not able to provide the tools, motivation and training to promote success or to create a positive and productive team!"
bad,Great job for someone who does not have a family or a life. The pay is good because of the union but the scheduling is very unstable. you never know what kind of day you will have because there is no way for them to judge the jobs they give you because no one has physically seen them. You are the sales person installer and everything. It really is taxing after a while and you get burnt out. The local install manager is a cool guy and tries to buffer between us and upper management. No complaints on him.
bad,If you have nothing to do and do not wish to contribute this is the place to be.  The management is horrible.  The staff is wonderful and SO under appreciated.
bad,"odd  and long hours, ghetto, dose not pay well, customers are crazy offices crazy too, a lot to learn, Do very car about employees, very boring job,  only 30 lunch."
bad,Management in transition. I did not feel I was trained properly. The expectations were to high. They did not follow through with sales leads as promised.
bad,ADT is a great security company that provide customers with quality customer service. There is constant change within the company. we are constantly receiving inbound calls with customer needing assistance.
bad,Commission only sales with more emphasis on metrics that do not lead to sales.  Poor training and follow up with a culture of doing whatever it takes to make the number but no support from upper manangement.
bad,"Nothing much to say. We worked outside going door to door in the freezing rain, cold, snow, ice, etc trying to sell security systems. A few times some people called the police on me. I recall one day I was freezing cold and my hands was shaking so the lady perhaps assumed I was on something and then she called the police on me. The job was only based on commission pay so we did not get a sell we did not receive a check."
bad,Expected to make between 300-700 per hour. No real management direction. No room to move up in the company. Schedules can change dramatically living no room for home and work balance
bad,This company has changed for the worse. The managers don't value their employees and long time employees have left the company due to all the changes.
bad,"Contacting customer via email, sales force data base and mailers. you learn to build you own personal relationship with the customer to gain there trust. Management team should put more focus on employees they would get better results. The hardest part about the job is the charge backs, if a customer does not keep the service for 6 months the full commission is taken back. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers and sharing best practices."
bad,"A ADT Monitoramentos, após adquirir a parte de monitoramentos da empresa Siemens, se perdeu completamente e ficou desorganizada, ocorreu corte, e não pagavam hora extra, perdiam atestados médicos, ficou completamente perdida."
bad,"ADT hires you in with promises of company provided leads, and then flips the communication to even if we don't give you a lead you are expected to hit the goals we have set. Which only 20% of agents were hitting. The company leads were reassigned to the call center and top5%  agents are in rebellion as they see 1/3 of their Commissions vanish. The Newest agents with no referral base are averaging 1/2 of the goal making a paltry 20K a year and putting in 60-70 hours a week in the field/office/road."
bad,"it was an ok place to work for money but no flexibility with hours in the Doc. Mgmt Dept."
bad,I did not like working for this company nor the long hours and little pay. I do not have much else to say really. I do not think door to door sales is a good career to be in.
bad,"ADT sales is a very easy way to make a living if you want a job that doesn't allow you to think for yourself, that mandates what you do with your work day into your personal time and that promotes selling no matter what their customer service is like. "
bad,The most dedicated and commited front line employees in the industry who strive every day to improve service delivery to their customers.
bad,Training needs  to be improved. 100% commission. Long hours.
bad,"ADT purchased my company, Brink's Home Security and immediately began changing the employee work experience from one of nurturing employees and encouraging advancement to a culture of ""churn and burn"" with an employee turnover rate of as much as 45%.  Our emphasis of open door policy for our operators was suddenly changed to a very limited and strict process in order to speak with upper management should the employee have a concern they wished to address.  My original co-workers were very pleasant to work with and strove for perfection each and every day.  However, after the acquisition, most of the employees who had been with Brink's since opening our data center in February 2006, began leaving as a result of the drastic change in philosophy and attitude towards our front line employees."
bad,"Opportunity completely oversold: income potential, massive cold calling producing less than minimal results."
bad,"My role as a team manager was spent primarily doing administrative tasks. "
bad,"•	Provided customers with resolution of billing and service issues"
bad,"A typical dat at ADT was a very busy work environment. I learned maNy databases, how to keep a balance and stay focused on protocol. The management was required to train, encore is often times sharply. My co-workers were very focused and helpful. The hardest part of the job was overcoming the sales people's attitudes as they addressed you as their support. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace, it kept you busy."
bad,"I worked for this company for almost 11 years and few weeks ago I resigned and all communication was via my immediate manager, none of the other departments like HR, OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE showed interest in why I wanted to resign. It seems as if everyone was happy I am leaving the company"
bad,"ADT is a good job for students straight out of High School. However, it is very hard to move up in the company. Alot of the opportunities are given to those who are close with managment on personal level rather than professional abilities. If you need consistancy in your career this is not the place for you. Standards and expectations change very very frequently. The worst part about these changes is that due to the nature of the business, we often do not have time to have team meetings. This is not a good thing because all calls are audited and you WILL be held accountable for these new expectations whether your management has had time to make you aware of the changes or not. Very stressful job. One great thing however, is that more often than not they offer overtime."
bad,"Big turnover. Most of the time the company just doesn't have enough reps to serve customers more comfortably, causing the reps to get turned down for time requested off or to flex.         Opeseseating."
bad,Lots of problems getting payroll out or right.  It seems like I might not be getting the pay correctly sometimes amd HR is impossible to speak with.  The culture is dog eat dog and very competitive.
bad,"Pay is good my manager was bad, corporate policies have no flexibility which makes it hard to feel like you are providing the best service to the customer, hurry up and get the job done so you can do the next job to meet your quota or else,also must be a salesman and meet a quota of up sales each month or get fired.   NOTE: this was a good place to work until beginning of 2018 then started down hill and got worse every month. Corporate is more interested in bottom line than in customer and employe satisfaction."
bad,ADT talks about being the leader in thier industry but that's all it is.. just talk. Cant be the leader when your company strategies are reactive. Technology is old. Both for the employees and the customers. Development is poor with a huge divide between front line employees and management.
bad,they have the most God awful schedules with split days off. The amount of hats that you have to wear heavily outweigh the amount of money you are paid. You have to ask for permission to use the bathroom like you're a child and things are always changing for the worse.
bad,the manager is not experienced in accounts department the staff had to do her work the staff knew more then her the manager should have management skill especially how to deal.with staff members should be more professional because Adt security is a International company
bad,"Very juvenile atmosphere, they do not pay on time, they often miscalculate your hours and don’t pay accurately, office politics are over business judgment."
bad,"Workdays are routine and often stressful. There is a lack of communication which makes any role within this company difficult. Management offers some help, but show little patience with new hires."
bad,"While ADT is well known and has a great reputation, it's current CEO is not involved with employees and is hardly ever seen in the headquarters building or visiting field sites. What a shame!"
bad,"Pay could be better, most times fast pace environment, loud environment, unorganized and unprofessional job, company needs better training for entire staff."
bad,There were a lot of good things about ADT but recent changes to leadership resulted in so much change it was hard to keep up with what the expectations were.
bad,Irving Field Support Managers are corrupt. The show favoritism and  one manager in particular walks around with nasty attitude all day.  They curse and use profanity on the floor. The managers at Irving FSC have brought the department down.
bad,"ADT was not a good fit for me.  The most frustrating thing for me was that you were not given time to wrap up call notes before another call came in - calls just rolled one to the next, to the next, to the next.  If you put your phone in a holding pattern, you were counseled.  It's good for some people, it just was not a good fit for me.  "
bad,"There is no real management. The managers are lovely people but they don't really take charge of anything. You constantly get grief off customers due to delays in call back times, caused from rubbish training that is given and working with lazy people. The pay rates are terrible for the hours that you work. If you want a good wage you will have to work here for at least 10 years AND EXCEED every year! better off just working somewhere else. Just all around badly managed and they are always replacing staff as nobody wants to stay."
bad,"For now it pays the bills. I have been here about 1 year. But honestly at this point I am ready to move on. During the interview and training ""they"" make it sound awesome. Lots of advancement, so many career opps and benefits....but the reality is they just need a body to answer the phone. During training they straight up said ""We need you more than you need us""....Wish I had thought about that at the time. I probably would have left right then,"
bad,"Good work life balance. "
bad,"Commision only, not enough hands on training.  Expected to produce like people who have been there for many years.  No salary.  Poor leads, not enough company appoinments."
bad,"Corporate ADT has a great name, but doesn't truly look out for their employees. The concern is fully on the end result. Doesn't truly believe that if you take care of your employees, that they will take care of their custoemrs"
bad,"I was left sitting at a cubicle, my coat on the back of my chair for over 2 weeks before someone even asked me my name and title."
bad,"Call center environment is a little loud, constant calls due to weather 80 percent of the time. And the pay is not the best at all. However, they did offer a lot of overtime."
bad,"I have worked at many places and can truly say that I hated every last second spent in this second-rate company. It is a very juvenile work environment and they prefer to hire young people.  The compensation is a low ($11) hourly rate plus commission.  This might sound great but the commission is based on a curve.  Yes, a curve.  You are also classified into tiers.  If you are in Tier one, you will stay there because you are getting the best calls as well as the most calls, so  your chance to make money greatly increases.  Likewise, if you are in Tier 3 you might as well start looking for another job. You are getting customer service calls and billing calls, with little chance to convert.  And obviously if you are in the middle tier it might still work out for you."
bad,"Precisa melhorar muito, principalmente na escolha da supervisao nao tem criterio nenhum. Tratam os funcionarios muito mal, ficam rindo dos erros dos funcionarios na cara dos mesmos, so e promovido quem e puxa saco aos inves de fazeram selecao interna, se nao vao com a sua cara e demissao na certa, misturam pessoal com profissional. Vivem gritando falando palavroes sem se preocupar com ninguem. Acho muita falta de respeito. Nao indico pra ninguem. Empresa pessima de se trabalhar, se continuarem assim nao vao chegar a lugar algum...."
bad,"Glass ceiling, inept management, low pay and constant change of metrics and rules. Favoritism and a middle school mentality of even long-tenured people."
bad,A typical day excessive call volumes. I learned so much about technical support and troubleshoot security systems and patience. Most of management was not connected with employess and there was never any positive criticism...
bad,"installed devices such as security systems, card access, cameras, had a computer and work phone. great team environment. crawl spaces and attics were the hardest part of the job. most enjoyable part was being paid to drive."
bad,Good job security however shift hours can be poor and there is minimal team morale and seemingly no interest on improving internal processes and procedures.
bad,they chose what reps get calls. Alot of times i am sitting for over 10 minute waiting for a call and my co worker is getting calls back to back and they expect everybody to compete for commission and shift rankings which inst fair if everyone getting the same opportunity the company doesn't offer isn't a level playing field. For the past two days I have came to work and got 1 sales due to no receiving many calls.
bad,"Unless you're an authorized dealer, don't waste your time or sanity working in residential sales. Company openly says they prefer to sell over the phone or through authorized dealers than use their own sales reps and union installers. Becoming a sub contracting company and the quality reflects that."
bad,"Pertenecía a un canal comercial que requería disponer muchísimas horas en la calle sin importar el clima saliendo muy temprano y volviendo bastante tarde los días que tocaba viajar al interior. Es una empresa que internamente realmente maneja cada detalle de forma minuciosa para ofrecerle a los clientes productos y servicios de excelencia y estoy segura que en ese rubro, son los mejores. El trato en si a los empleados por parte de los jefes de equipo, no era alentador ni se promulgaba el respeto en el trato, ni por el trabajo de los demás, por lo que en ese sentido debo ser honesta era duro trabajar en esas condiciones. Lo que rescato de esta empresa como dije anteriormente es el buen servicio y el respaldo a los clientes y la remuneración económica."
bad,"You had to make sure to get into work early to find a seat ,if you had a manager then you were updated on your metrics but that was rare. As long as you got along with management then you were given more opportunities to explore the company"
bad,"The manager pushed sales, which is normal, but the way they had you achieve your goals was unethical. The management was placing sales for me even if the sale was not completed. It made my numbers look great at first, but I was not seeing the financial benefits in the end. The following months sales numbers would look awful because they would give you a negative sale for every sale that fell through, even though it was management adding the sale. I left after three months because I felt the company, specifically the management was unethical."
bad,"-Δεν ειχα συναδελφους"
bad,"the company was great to work for at first, but there is not much room for advancement. managers do not care about their employees so it makes for a very crummy morale."
bad,"this job had its pros and cons, main pros were its commission based job with plenty of bonus opportunity, fun learning experience from veteran sales associate, its cons were that they took a long time to pay for contracts and they wouldn't provide security or a healthy work environment."
bad,Management here was awful. The compensation for your efforts was sub par. The room for advancement is non existent.
bad,"Don't count on the company to get you any appointments.  They will try to sell over phone and all leads you get is the ones they couldn't sell. "
bad,Typical day of work consists of changing gears and putting out fires.  Managers aren't engaged with their people but really know how to manage up.  Senior Managers don't really care how people are treated.  Micromanage.  A lot of good people have come and gone.  Learn how to treat people like adults...
bad,"Very poor local management."
bad,Not a good place to work. Sales People and Installers are treated like 2nd class people. No respect for what we did to benefit the company.
bad,"Management is terrible a lot of creamy talk but when you need"
bad,"As an ADT Sales Consultant, my job was to build relationships with customers and maintain those relationships. That is the only part of my role at ADT that I enjoyed. I cold-called customers on a daily basis and sometimes even door knocked around neighborhoods for sales leads. ADT employees are on monthly quota that if they fail to meet each month, they are terminated. This quota rises every few months that an employee is employed there. My schedule required me to work Monday through Friday but my manager required me to work on Saturdays without any additional pay. Management is God-awful. I rarely got any help from my supervisors and if i had a question that I needed to ask my boss, she vanished from the office. Every month or so I would be instructed of a certain task that I needed to achieve. Once I had achieved that task, I was pulled aside and told that I had done it wrong and that I needed to perform it in a totally different manner than originally instructed. I  must say that I really did enjoy my co-workers. They were some of the best that I have had. The hardest part of the job was getting help from my manager. This became extremely stressful after a full year of employment."
bad,"If you are looking for a sales job and like to go door to door this is for you. What ADT doesn't tell you through the whole process is that they want you to be a door to door sales person. You will work nights and weekends. They also wont tell you that you have to make over 100 phone calls a week with the hopes of getting someone on the phone who will eventually hang up on you, it literally takes making over 500 phone calls to get one person interested. Compensation plan changes all the time and its not in favor for the sales rep. There is a reason why ADT is ranked in the top ten of worst places to work."
bad,"company does not pay enough commission, for the work or contracts.  Company turns over many employees, managers very much use the representatives."
bad,"ADT is so large that you are basically an unknown entity.  They have difficulty paying commissions, and no support when that happens.  Try to call the toll free number sometime, and fell the frustration that customers and employees have when trying to get help."
bad,"Work day is full of interaction with the customer and technician."
bad,If you want a job that is for right now then this is the place for you. If you would like a job that you can move up in and be somebody then this is not the co for you.
bad,"the co workers were awesome , Management however was very poor, the employees were not listened to at all for ideas on how to make their working days less stressful."
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had, very unprofessional and unethical. Poor management and absolutely no leadership skills from any one at  the company."
bad,"adt was the type of job that if you can sit on your bum all day and get paid to talk to the phone, youll love it. if youre a person who requires more activity throughout the day, youll loath it"
bad,"The ADT department that I worked in is campaigning a ""Customer Obsessed Culture"" initiative but fails to equip it's employees with the tools, training, or empowerment to fulfill this service to it's customers."
bad,"De afdeling waar ik werkzaam was, was zeer gezellig en de collega's waren geweldig."
bad,"A typical day would consist of close to 100 calls and a few angry customers. It was trying sometimes,  but I love a challenge."
bad,anwering incoming and making outbound calls in call center environment
bad,Thrown right into the field and expected to hit quotas with not enough on the job training. great pay though when you are able to sell.
bad,The turnover of management is too high. I have worked here for 8 years & seen far too many service managers/general managers come & go to make a long-lasting impact.
bad,"Typical high pressure commission only sales job. If you are not used to a commission only structure, don't even consider it. Seasoned sales reps should be OK if u have a side hustle(job). Newbies don't even waste your time unless you just want to say you have a job. Typical day includes cold calling, door to door prospecting, utilizing computer data base to obtain leads. Some days include late night appointments/ call nights."
bad,"Its more like slavery or servitude. No base salary, horrible expense reimbursement (especially with regard to your personal vehicle use), demoralizing management tendencies, all lead to a horrible experience. Its a door to door and telemarketing job. The process of calling a sale in is miserably over-complicated. Many weeks you are expected to work on Saturdays. The products and services you are selling are hilariously over priced, and remember, this is a commission only job. Installations of your systems often times go poorly resulting in a reversal of a commission earned. Its not a job I would recommend to anyone."
bad,A typical day of service is one that is a lot of driving without any assurance that the follow up by the company has been done. I learned a lot about the security business. The management locally is very interested in success and my coworkers are very interested in earning a living. The two do not always work together we. The hardest part of the job is the travel with no sales and the most enjoyable is the making of a sale.
bad,Great cafeteria. A tough environment where everything gets thrown at you but great for job experience. Management is stuck in old ways and continue to make straightforward things complicated by poor decisions.
bad,"Decent entry level opportunity.  I believe the Hawaii branch closed. Competition with outside franchises selling ADT products made no sense. Commission structure and referrals process was poorly managed, often unfair."
bad,"The 1st three years working with ADT was okay but changing the business model, and changing quality scoring for employees became a toxic and stressful atmosphere."
bad,Idiots prosper. If you can be a mindless drone whom Dosnt care about actually helping clients or any sort of resolution look no further this is the job for you . The company is very reactionary and Dosnt think first. Bleeding clients left and right . No to little training. No actual coaching or guidance. No manger support they are to busy taking calls too . Since we are trying to look as best as we can so Telus bails us out of our mess . We literally have a whole team dedicated to answer calls just to place them back on holdagain to make it seem like we are answering calls quickly . Terrible terrible terrible .. how about changing billing the qtrl instead of monthly and reaching into clients banks f
bad,They hired me and I left a fulltime job to join adt... and they had no work in my area so I had to work outta state..away from my family for 3 or 4 weeks at a time...and they complained that I was a liability because they kept having to send me to other market areas to work like it was my fault Columbus Georgia sucks for work..I was fired because my hotel stays were costing them???
bad,"Standard office job. "
bad,"You work on commission. Almost  8 hours a day, Monday to Friday and do not get paid hourly so sometimes you may go weeks and still not end up making any sales. All in all, security systems are very hard to sell if you are good at door to door selling then right on."
bad,"I worked in a middle management position with ADT or JCI as they claim to be called. The reason given for the JCI brand being pushed was due to the lack of trust in the ADT brand.  In my experience they are not making any effort in improving the brand."
bad,"Es una muy buena empresa, lastima del personal en la ofna. De León, Gto. Hay mucho favoritismo y mal ambiente de travajo por lo mismo y sobre el código de ética nulo totalmente en esta oficina."
bad,"Call centers are pretty much all the same. One of the higher paid customer service jobs. Not much time off, and the schedule options aren't great. It's a good place if you need a job."
bad,"ADT is a good company to work for however, they don't allow for real life experiences. The managers aren't giving good coaching too many are micro-managers. The events that managers could be proactive or at least bring to your attention to avoid being in jeopardy aren't being done. Too many hats to wear will cause undue stress on your workers."
bad,This is not the company you would want to work for if you do not want to work on commission only. this is not the right fit for you or anyone.  I will not recommend this company.
bad,Being a service technician pays well for bit having a formal education. Management isn't the best but they also don't care about service. They only care about sales.
bad,"Not completely fair operation. Managers not helpful. HR do not keep privacy on issues. If there is proper training giving and managerial help on closing sales, then there is opportunity to make money. Even helpful managers are stretched thin to not properly help reps."
bad,"You won't do well unless you kiss butt & are part of a club. Some great coworkers made it worth the low pay. I am not a fan of being micromanaged when they cannot get to work on time or do what is asked of us."
bad,A lot of structural changes and M&A activity makes this a difficult environment to grow your career. Good people and interesting work - could be better managed.
bad,"Not a good company to be a custoer of, or to work for.  After they made our canadian branch the ""z6th region of the united states"", alot of good employees quite because they became a number to the head office out of the states."
bad,"This job was something to do while looking for a real job. The pay was commission base only. Training should have been offered weekly or at least monthly to properly equipped workers,"
bad,"report to work to setup appointments and make phone calls, once ph calls are made., then you are off to appointments and to pitch sales for the security system"
bad,I do not like to work there. Greeted guest according fine dining accordance. Manage taking orders for large parties of diners with food dietary knowledge.
bad,"log in read emails answer billing questions,     My immediate manager was great, we were restricted as to the information I could give the customer. even if their alarm was not working.  Just make the payments"
bad,"I had a great start at ADT Security and promises were made to adjust straight commission structure,This promise was not kept and I had 4 different Sales Managers in the one year I was there. Straight , commission compensation made it difficult to stay and the Alarm System/Surveillance Camera prices made selling very difficult. Great fellow Salesmen-but needed a more consistent pay cycle."
bad,Set a prospect list then call and visit leads. Set appointments with businesses and attended appointments set up by the corporate offices. morning call to collaborate with co workers. must be super organized and self motivated.
bad,"Left after 27 years. Practically got pushed out door. No loyalty to employees. Company constantly changing. Unorganized and stressful. "
bad,ADT is such a big company that they dont care much for their employees. I was put in some of the worst conditions working for this company and they offered little to no recognition. They don't pay very well either.
bad,Would not recommend a friend. Things changes everyday and the agents always have to adjust. I am leaving because of the constant changes and the lack of care management have for the employees
bad,"Lack of inter-departmental communications, employee retention is not a priority, high turnover due to management not caring about building relationship with employees.  Some members of the management plays favoritism."
bad,"Management is not dependable and there is not an open door policy. There is a cafe onsite and an ""entertainment center"" but the entertainment area is rarely used"
bad,"You are 100% expected to consistently hit your metrics strictly or you are written up. Management will try to casually comment on your issues with the metrics laid out but at the end of the day, they are being pressured by higher ups to get the metrics met. They are too willing to hire people that have no business in a call center environment just to have bodies in the seats."
bad,"After working here for almost 2 years the company has changed ALOT! When you see tenured seasoned people who have been here 10 yrs plus leaving that says a lot. Bouns structure is hardly anything anymore, It's hard to get OT scheduled. They ONLY promote within if you are one of the favorites. If you ask 3 managers the same question you will get 3 different answers. I used to love coming to work but it's a chore. The benefits were great however they cannot keep new people."
bad,I went door to door or had scheduled appointments that I would need to educate people on what system was best for their business. I also delt with current customers and took care of any needs they may have had
bad,They were always putting un-realistic goals up and kept pressuring me to obtain more leads on my dime! Yet even their own lead marketing kept given me leads 50-miles out of my area!
bad,"Everyday routine customers are horrible, they are trying to make all in one agent meaning one stop shop no transfers must be able to handle all issues."
bad,My particular situation may not be comparable to all ADT locations.  In my experience I was hired as the receptionist and shortly after was promoted to Office Manager because the previous Manager quit unexpectedly.  I was very overwhelmed with no training and ADT was slow at hiring me a receptionist leaving more responsibility on me than was possible to maintain.
bad,"Way too much walking, not enough pay and the management could be a lot better. I felt they need more help in the office than they did with making a promotional team."
bad,"overall ADT is a great brand. There are definitely challenges to modern approaches to doing business. Also, the technology must be improved. I believe the CEO and CMO are fantastic! However, everything does not get to the wakefield level. The brilliance of ADT is in the acquisition model. They suffer greatly with regards to appreciation for the ground saleforce. They are merely paid lead generation tools."
bad,i did not like the job because i did not like to be dropped off in the middle of washington dc at dark to walk door to door to sell security systems i did not feel safe
bad,Sitting on the phone for 7 1/2 hours is grueling. The management will not take the eschalation calls. There is little social interaction with fellow employees.
bad,There were difficulties there working night shift at the call centre not allowed to switch off the aircons at the early hours of the morning . Good side of it communication with different customers others are rude but I have learned a lot how to handle those situations that's where I learned that the customer is always right no matter which circumstances.
bad,"Creo que no pude hacerme un hueco en esa empresa por la falta de liderazgo del jefe y sus malas formas, casi despóticas, hacia los compañeros. Mala organización comercial y peor formación"
bad,Great benefits and pay. management is horrible and disorganized. Company is always trying to get rid of good employees and bring in subcontractors who are not trained right to do a good job for the customers. Customers are great amd also co workers.
bad,Merger with protection1 was supposed to make things better but they got worse. The management do a poor job training and do not value employees. Work days are long and stressful
bad,"The company was much more of an enjoyable work environment prior to the sale and merger with Apollo. Since the merger, several changes has effectively made the sales manager position obsolete"
bad,This was a very interesting job - you get to save peoples lives and speak to many people daily that may need help. It was very different and I enjoyed it.
bad,"management is horrible, you get provided an array of benefits but the medical is horrible. advancement is difficult because of favoritism. they treat it like working at a call center or their call center rather should be taken more seriously like its a real job and not just a step up from mcdonalds where almost anyone can get a job. lets be real, no one comes of age and says ""i want to work at a call center when i'm a grown up."""
bad,Went looking for opportunities to increase worth ethic and social skills. This is the place for it! Great for interacting and self motivation. Def. a good fit for the youth.
bad,"During my stay, with ADT, I felt as though the training was not great.  Being a field worker, was not great, and their was no compensation, for my travel time."
bad,Worked for company through Kelly's temporary agency. No secure job placement after 90 days. A lot of worker did not get hired permanently after 90 days. Lots of gossip and childish workers.
bad,little rock has a poorly run office the management needs more training. the company doesn't take care of there employees. the training that you receive there I don't feel I learned enough.
bad,"Small Business Consultant "
bad,"After the company went public and was bought out by Apollo, the commission scales were shifted so much that many people left the job without giving two weeks notice. By many, I mean half the department I worked in left."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers because I enjoy helping others. I worked with some great people. I learned how to listen and assist. I learned to get it right the 1st time so customer does not have to call back. I learned how to become more of  team player by working together with co-workers for the good of the company.
bad,Ok company. Company always offering over time. Room to make a lot of money doing over time. Hard work with little incentive. Company does not have the best benefits.
bad,space was to open. needed more private areas. management needed to take more in charge and watch employees lunch time periods
bad,Create your own networking group and leads.  Lack of leadership and support.  When you leave the company they give your leads to authorized dealers.
bad,"The management is very click-like and quick to turn on you if it benefits them. If you are just out of highschool or going through college this is a decent job, but you could probably do better. You will hate it within a year. Then benefits are good but the pay sucks. They micromanage you at every turn and you cant really trust anyone."
bad,"Pays Bills, Every day is mostly the same.24 hours  a day. No Holidays off. No advancement. No sick time. Interesting people. Mostly phone work"
bad,"To much turn over with this company, no incentive for help from management. High level of greed and commissions are to low."
bad,"Pay and insurance was really great and cheap, however the atmosphere was a low level office job, had a bad bug infestation that they took a long time to take care of and a overall really depressing atmosphere."
bad,"Between the dealers and phone sales, way to much competition between the company.  The upper leadership is blind to see how the branches are ran  Poor install managers"
bad,The job is fast. You have to be ready to take the calls and help the customer in a timely matter. Great company to work for. Co-workers are good people to be around at work.
bad,They don't believe in supporting their employees. They make it clear that customers are important and they don't care how customer to to the employees.
bad,There is a peak to the advancement. Constant changes that are not fully planned and leads to constant confusion on what to do with customer systems. The nature of the job is stressful and monotonous. If you enjoy talking with frustrated customers all day everyday then this is the job for you!
bad,"In my current role, I handle a lot of emails and escalated accounts.  Many people have been there a long time and are not open to new ideas or people."
bad,"Sink or swim. You will not be trained to sell here. You are expected to do that on your own or quit. The turn over rate is incredible. The company and products are great. People, not so much."
bad,"Since the centralization of most of the departments, staff is on edge and do not know what to expect within the future.  Management discloses very little info to staff regarding the ongoing restruturing process."
bad,If this is your only means of income beware.  Always keep contracts closed and also make sure installations go as plan. Had an experience where contracts closed but installation didn't go as planned and that resulted in $$$ coming out of my paycheck.
bad,not employee friendly don't care about the customer on phones for 8 hours management rough. co workers not friendly
bad,"* Long hours, little reward for higher performers."
bad,"micro-managing at its best. systems used are out dated. unreasonable stats to meet, little pay, pto was great but never time to take"
bad,"Typical day: filing "
bad,Let the rating speak for itself..... There is information on the internet...
bad,"This is a good company to work for if you are just in it for the money. However, it is a terrible place to work. It was actually in the Huffington Post top ten worst places to work. There is always mandatory overtime, and breaks are always reduced, to as low as five minute breaks. The entire staff is very unfriendly due to all of the terrible things we have to deal with and exhaustion. The work/life balance is terrible, because it is impossible to get time off, even though it is a benefit. The hours are long and hard. I was working about fifty hours a week. The manager are never to be found. There are frequently problems with getting all of your commission. There are also contests to offer benefits, but even if you meet the requirement of the contest, nobody ever seems to get the bonus. Also take a look at the turnover rate, they have one of the worst. People are quitting or getting fired every single week."
bad,"On a typical day I would converse with different police and fire departments.  Communicate with customers on different types systems and educated them on their panels.  The hardest part of the job is getting a customer to calm down, so that I could help them and everyday is the same thing."
bad,I only worked here for just short of 3 months. I value the training and skills I learned and I learned I am capable of working in a stressful environment.
bad,empresa con poca estabilidad laboral. con demora en sus compromisos poca reacción en gestión ............
bad,"Working for ADT the last 9 1/2 years was a wonderful experience until about a year and a 1/2 ago they broke away from Tyco then everything became very different."
bad,I liked working for ADT because of the people that I worked with
bad,"From the very minute you clock in until the minute you clock out you are taking back to back to back calls from angry customers because they've been on hold for 30 mins. You have no time to even breathe in between calls. The customers were so rude and very disrespectful. The managers frown upon even getting up to use the restroom. Everything is always changing, always a change in policy so its hard to keep up. Quality pulls about 5 calls a month and they will ALWAYS find something you did wrong so you get written up. The bathrooms were always nasty. There was a few times a terminator had to come because there was a case of fleas, bed bugs, and spiders. I wouldn't recommend anyone work there. However, there were some really great people I met there though. But some of the managers are jerks and think they are so much better than you."
bad,It was a learning experience I wouldn't work for the sales team again but I learned to have more patients and became more determined
bad,This company has not been the best experience in my book. The company doesnt seem to work on a culture and I personally believe that is what a company needs to strive.
bad,Upper management treats floor managers as if they were hourly employees that are easily replaced.  Upper management is very dishonest about MIP and the job security is nill.
bad,"A great place to work, a company with equal opportunity to move in"
bad,"This is an outdoor sales position, with little to any guarantees you have to put in hard long hours to make a living."
bad,High turnover among sales staff.  Negative approach to motivation of sales force.
bad,"cons:call volume really high "
bad,Me costo adaptarme dentro de lo que es el rubro venta. Era consciente de que cobrabas si obtenias una venta osea por comision. Por eso la adaptacion al puesto me costo.
bad,"Typical day at work involves tier 3 engineers providing tier 1 support for client configuration issues. Multiple critical projects happening all at once with no sense of direction or support from the business or leadership teams. Non-Technical executives making technical decisions without the input of the people they hired to make such decisions. This IT department is managed by exception, not by standards, policies and best practices. This structure or lack of structure makes administration of servers and networks complete chaos. My manager and the team of people that I work with are the only parts of this job that keep me sane. "
bad,"everyone wants to be boss , havent really been able to excel ."
bad,A typical day at ADT is a long day. It's the same thing pretty much every call either a complaint or dissatisfied customer without the resources to help them further.
bad,"management not that great poor scheduling pay was poor poor location desk sharing, baby setting envornment"
bad,I worked as an independent contractor so there was a lot of ups and downs working as IC. I enjoyed being outdoors all day but did not like the inconsistency in the pay.
bad,"A typical day at my work place is high pace and constant multi tasking. The range of duties vary from assisting sales reps, install managers, service managers, coordination managers, accounting managers, verifying proper paperwork has been submitted to correct any account issues. Make connections between customer and sales to make sure contracts are getting done and systems are being installed. assist customers in their questions and issues. Handle customers confidential bank account and credit card information and making outbound collection calls. Being here for almost 5 years I've learned a lot, from customer service to processing, coding, and making account ledgers. Management has been a downhill terror; when i first started the management here was amazing to work with and their assistance was enough to make employees want to stay with the company. Since then, the management has changed and out with the old and in with the untrained and inexperienced. New directors and management was brought in without knowledge of the way the company and the system works. The company doesn't higher from within, they look for contractors and then higher them in. Which is sad when we as a team that knows the ins and outs have worked hard to move up and not even get reviewed for the positions. The hardest part about the job is that the different departments don't work together, no one can get on the same page which causes a lot of unneeded issues and eventually reflects back to the customer and causes more issues. The most enjoyable part about the job is my team directly, we have worked a very"
bad,"Too corporate, too disconnected from reality, they treat the empoyees and customers as numbers and like dirt . I survived 12 long years with them from a previous company take -over , and got phyically sick and depressed . Glad to be gone and retired - I made it !!!!"
bad,"A typical day at work would be arriving, sitting down in cubicle, logging into phone, start handling alarms, and 3 breaks in between time. I've learned that the customers' satisfaction is the number one priority. Management was a little slow on doing their job. Co-workers worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with guidelines and policies within the workplace. Management would change guidelines and policies frequently and would take their time informing employees of the changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
bad,Learned a lot about the Security business
bad,"If you operate well in an extremely high pressure environment then this is the place for you. However if constant pressure, looking over your shoulder and starting from scratch each month is sounds a bit overwhelming do not even consider working here. You don't get paid nearly enough for the pressure put on your shoulder. Income is avg at best."
bad,ADT is a company that was leading in the Security Systems industries and during those things that would keep them out front inthe industry.
bad,"My experience is a little bit different as I was with Broadview Security and ADT bought us out, but from the point that things started changing for the worse. Lot of redundancies that they knew about but never took the time to fix. I'd get more specific, but it's not worth it. They say that there is an open-door policy, but that's really just so they can have the satisfaction of slamming it in your face. It's more like walking into a screen door that you didn't notice was there. Have a complaint? What do you know, you're just a ""insert position here"". Also, when they send out emails to update you of current procedures, you'll only be given the first half of the procedure and be forced to go find the rest in the training manuals that the operators don't actually have. Fun Fact: I checked where it ""was"" and it wasn't there either. No one had the rest of it. Emailed the supervisor about it and I was made to look like the idiot. Work here if you would like your opinion and your job performance to be undervalued."
bad,It is decent there. New people will get hired in at a higher wage. They care more about stats than the customers. The management is alright. To me the best part of the job was the customers
bad,"Micromanages your every move, Rigid &  Punitive, No concern for employees' well-being. Example: if you're out sick with the flu at the end of the year & you've used all of your PTO..you will be terminated. I have never worked for a company that cares so little about its employees. I despised the management team so much that I left on my own terms without notice. Would not recommend ADT!"
bad,"Although training is 4 weeks, they send you out on your own with very little knowledge.  You really have to wing it and rely on senior employees to be available to answer your questions.  Even after being there a year, you cant possibly know everything to make you very successful.  Then your at the mercy of having it installed on time & smoothly.  I did love working with the homeowners.  Really miss that."
bad,The company is more concerned with their bottom line and not taking care of the customer. The income potential isn’t possible based on the commission structure.
bad,Your sitting in front of customers homes a lot waiting...this job has a Large turnover rate For a reason 100% commissions hours are long you typically work all day because your on call but you only get paid for job going in ground if cancel you get money taken back from you They do a lot of things or tell you to do a lot of things that I bet most customers would love to know. They will do Anything to make sure customer signs That contract appointments are from 8am - 11am and 3pm to 6pm but you’re in your car the wholeeee time they will make you drive a hour one way in am and another hour and half to pm no where near your house so your driving a hour home there’s times where customer never answers so you have to wait in your car the entire window either you waste gas or you sweat in your car waiting instead of going to other appointments “ you only get paid for customers that sign that contract no hourly what so ever ! Even on Wednesday they have a 5 hour meeting you don’t get paid for. You get paid by rank also so if customers are canceling on your behalf regardless if it’s your fault or not you will get less money for future jobs which is crazy I had one customer had hospital call her in front of me about her son being in a car wreck she left immediately but they counted that job against me and said that’s just company policy
bad,"This company is good at getting you started, but was following behind on keeping everyone in the loop. When the company went through a merge half the staff got let go with no warning."
bad,"This company has many tenured employees which can be very appealing. Unfortunately those tenured employees do not seem to care much about how the company is run and just want a job. I want a job as well as to work for a great company. You will find the job and that's it. Some people think it's great. I used to think it was great. Too many leadership changes in a short period tells me what looks to be a stable company, is really not."
bad,New management is making it impossible to work with a positive attitude. Very little help from management getting tasks done. Worst worker morale I have ever been around. Very hostile environment to work in.
bad,No reason for me to have to fill this portion out because i am not interested in leaving a review since i have no choice here is your review lf this company
bad,Very high pressure like most sales organizations. Follow through and support are lacking. Expectations are high for salespeople and managers without consideration to loss of market share or the willingness to change with the times. People that will succeed here need to have the ability to conform in spite of logic and work the plan. Not for everyone but for some this place is a winner!
bad,"I somewhat enjoyed working and hustling for ADT, but a coworker was stealing sales from me after a large deal I made with a company. He helped me close the deal because I needed his experience since I was fairly new. They said they treat each other like ""family"" but not really. I made a deal with him saying he can have 2-3 units (sales) a month from the big sale I got, but he took 7-8 in one month from my back. I told management but they didn't care. I reported to HR in Dallas but they didn't care. The only people who cared were my other sales peers, two of them, who end up leaving after me because of the behavior and treatment they witness being done."
bad,Some of the managers were slaking when it came to needing help. They never wanted to help when you needed it. Over all it was a pretty good place to work.
bad,They started treating us like children. When taking breaks they wanted you to log all activity even bathroom breaks on your phone. Management played games when it came to moving into other departs or trying to move up. They'd act like they want you to succeed help you interview and say you do a good job score well on all their standards then tell you oh sorry that's still not good enough. The pay is low with economy rising they still don't care. Training was poorly done and always in a hurry and last minute. People in customer care didn't know what they were doing. Plus co-workers would act petty and start drama.
bad,"Promotions not based on your experience, years with the company or knowledge; but who you are friends with. Management that are friends with their agents are ok with their ""on the clock lunch breaks"". Unequal treatment among agents, some get away with more than others. Upper management disappears during inclement weather and holidays, but have expectations of lower management and agents to be present. Noticing numerous smoke breaks and extra vacation time among certain members of management. Most call center environments probably have some of the same challenges, but this one has only gotten worse since they were bought out by a smaller company."
bad,"Covered 5 states servicing 1 customer, Left Monday morning home Friday evening. Training consisted of ride a longs with 2 other techs, no formal hands on training or tech support system in place, no documentation or repository to access manuals. The guys I worked around were good people and tried hard to make my transition into the job better but they also had to work their job queue. When direct manager was let go received no notice of who was filling that role or had contact with anyone from management. I decided to leave because the job turned into a construction electrician job pulling cables hundreds of feet and working from heights without any safety equipment. I was not doing what I expected to do, nor what I wanted to do. When I decided to resign I was told contact my manager to which I had no idea who that was. Over all it was not a good experience for me as I had no idea of company goals, expectations or ideas of their vision for the future or employees."
bad,the work was very fast paced. the supervisor constantly will inform you of the next job on your daily schedule and to let you know that the work had to to completed that day.
bad,"it is very hard to work here, it takes a mental stress on you because everything is so difficult to manage and work out. it is like working backwards."
bad,"- Monotonous recruiting (little variety - same thing every day)"
bad,"Difficult to feel encouraged, appreciated or motivated in an environment with fear and concern for your job security. There have been several reductions since the company was taken private a few years ago."
bad,We were under new management that didn’t last as long as I did and then when he was relieved of his duties we were micro-managed by the area sales manager from Chicago who could not help with anything requiring face to face attention
bad,"Some of the managers pick favorites and if your not in the loop, you don't get leads and they even give you bad leads to run you all over the state and cost you money in time and gas.  This is their game in getting you to quit (especially the women) so they can hire their male buddies."
bad,"The people are very nice, you'll enjoy interacting with them every day, it's the best thing about the job.  This is not a traditional recruiting experience though.  It is a Call Center.  At this location, recruiters are searching for straight-commission Outside Sales Representatives only.  The turnover rate is extremely high.  The Team Leaders do try to keep things upbeat.  This is a good project if you need something between long-term career opportunities."
bad,"Honestly, you can do less at places that pay at least the same, if not more, a stone's throw from there. Tenure is not an asset, but a liablity. Used to be a great work environment, but new management at the highest level have made that pretty much a thing of the past. You are a number to them, and if that number isn't high, goodbye."
bad,"work appointments were inconsistent so not having enough appointments to install in homes or businesses made it hard to maintain a consistent income.,  so i left"
bad,The products and services costs are higher than other firms. The market is saturated with over two dozen companies which offer the same services at half the cost.
bad,It was okay for a first job but I would never do that again. Its not a good fit for me or my skills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!
bad,"While working at ADT security services in Irving TX I have seen a lot of effort to improve the culture and the culture has improved over the past 6-8 months. I have also seen a lot of employees and managers come and go. The business is chaotic and has inconsistent goals. ADT is a good example of a company that always has a flavor of the month. I do not mind working in an environment that is always changing and evolving but the change that is implemented at ADT does not seem to move the cultural needle.  Unit Managers are not consistent amongst the messages they deliver to Team managers and several of them seem to be ""checked out"""
bad,"Operational Manager had very limited experience, and was not competent. Very unprofessional with both employees and customers. Wouldn't accept input from anyone else in the company."
bad,"ADT was a great place to work until they started bringing in new management. It then became a ""every person must fend for themselves"" work environment. Would not recommend anyone to work here. Pretty soon they won't need sales reps anymore."
bad,Pay was great but they took at least $1500 in training pay and over hired. Also the reimbursement program sucked and actually lost money on that side of the deal.
bad,Nothing to say about this company just be prepared to have lots of changes. ADT is a easy company to work for has its ups and downs like any other company
bad,"Commission based job with very little training ,No opportunity to close business. No leads given basically street business ,1st 5 months will be horrible ."
bad,"When I worked there in IT,it was a cutthroat culture with everyone grabbing for a higher position.  IT governance was horrible and the company suffered due to that lack.  This company has tons of money but they spend millions on pipe-dream projects that never get completed."
bad,"This was my first commission job. It was very hard a first, but I mastered this position. I met my husband selling security systems. However, we needed a salary to cover when business was slow."
bad,"It depends on your branch location as to how management will be. I really loved it my first couple of years, but it seems like the tier of management is all from sales backgrounds."
bad,"ADT used to be a Great company to work for and a place where you could make a Career not just a job. However the New focus is not on the employee but only profit, many times to the detriment of commissioned Sales people. They are much more focused on Corporate phone sales, DIY systems, and Dealer Sales and support these channels over the local Sales person in the branch office. "
bad,"Company was recently acquired, agreements with previous management did not transfer to new management.  The work as an installation/service technician isn't bad, can sometimes be enjoyable.  The problem is not knowing the schedule more than a day in advance.  Sometimes waking up to find out the day will involve a five hour drive to do one hour worth of work and would be expected to return the same day.  Makes it hard to maintain plans with friends and family.  Some days there is no work available which equates to no pay for that day, at other times, an 18 hour day may be required."
bad,I enjoyed working at ADT until I started to see how the management treated those down the ladder. They were extremely strict on breaks and time away from your phone. If you went over because you had to go to the restroom too many times then it counted against you.
bad,"Don't ever apply for ADT small business sales. You will be canceling accounts all day rather than making commission. I've been working in the sales department at ADT because I was FORCED to move to the other department. Ever since then, people who have been there for over 5-10 years have quit or got fired."
bad,"The work isn't that hard, but the work your doing is dangerous and the compensation for doing the job is not good at all. I risked my life everyday and was paid minimum wage. Thats not acceptable for me or to anyone for that matter."
bad,"I came from a culture that valued employees and valued the community that they were located. When I started, there was very little community involvement, especially in the billing department. Then about a year into working, the volunteer group was started to get more involved in the local community. Due to a change with the leadership this past year, the company is not focusing on the community. With this shift, I felt almost betrayed because of how much my community gave to me."
bad,"ADT is a fantastic company for someone who is just entering the workforce. It's your typical call center experience, but you are required to learn a ton of information which doesn't equate to the compensation they provide."
bad,"ADT will take you on a ride that you've never been on before and that you probably wont get back on again. Day shift is better than night, FACTS ONLY!"
bad,"In my 10 years I have bounced around looking for the great fit , but the management teams are not supportive.It's all in a who u know to advance.There is no training , so be prepared to learn day by day. You find out new things that are going on with the company everyday via email from corporate or word of mouth from associates. Just sad because so many people who work here have so many great things to offer but if your not a family member or best buds with a manager you won't advance or your voice will not be heard."
bad,"No management in place first 9 months. company sold and merged with competition. company generated appointments were not qualified. many times scheduled appointments were either at wrong address, wrong time or wrong day. product training was/is inadequate."
bad,"in my opinion and many I spoke with, there is a lack of team effort. each division, sales, operations and management, function as individual entities where it needs to be one team everyone working towards the same goal. making the customer happy."
bad,"The pay and benefits were good. Management was no help they had no clue on what we did and could not effectively help with concerns we had. they did not handle issues with co workers, they let problems linger."
bad,get to work and be on the phone till break time with friends and while we wil be eating talking about our clients and how e gonna set up the appointments and race to be to  the top of the telemaketer of the month all fun and games i guess
bad,"The co-workers which I have been privileged to work with are hard-working, but the cultural environment is more negative than positive.  Most of our accomplishments are only acknowledged by co-workers, as management seems detached from the processes, employees, and customers."
bad,Not the greatest job. You are a number produce and get paid. If you produce too much then you will not get promoted as they enjoy keeping good sales people in sales. Low producers turn into managers.
bad,"My typical day started at 6:45 a.m., and ended around 5-6 p.m. with too much headache to deal with. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, they were a great group of men, it was just management that was very unstable"
bad,"Aprendí cosas del oficio, tales como ofrecer promociones vía teléfono, hasta realizarse la compra del producto, la dirección y la gerencia era gente bastante explotadora, todos tuvimos la suerte del tiempo que trabajamos estábamos en blanco, teníamos obra social, una cuenta en el banco santander, un sueldo fijo mas, comisiones, no nos conocíamos mucho entre compañeros ya que la máxima durabilidad en ese empleo era de dos meses y 29 días, las chicas generanlmente renunciaban a los 10 o 15 dias, la parte mas complicada del trabajo era realizar las ventas, ya que hasta que realizabas una, recibías maltrato telefónico, y a la vez de tu supervisor, quien te decía que si no llegabas a realizar ciertas comisiones por semana no trabajarías mas, lo que mas me gusto fue que aprendí a sobrellevar ciertas situaciones."
bad,"Shift starts at 9 am.  We will check our emails to see if we have any scheduled appointments with possible customers.  If we do have appointments, we would drive to the potential customer's home and do a full walk around their house to see if they have any vulnerabilities that a potential burglar could use to break in their home.  I would go over and suggest what level of home security system that would give them a better peace of mind.  My management that I had while working at ADT were located in Seattle, WA, so most of our communication was through telephone and email.  I had issues with the management because I wasn't getting paid at all and management was slow to correct the issue.  My coworkers and I got along pretty well.  The hardest part of the job would be the constant driving between Anchorage-Wasilla and everything in between having to use my personal vehicle.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure that homes and the people that lived in them were safer after becoming a member of the ADT family."
bad,"The above line says it all! Also, a very divided company; small business sales and residential sales, as well as office staff and techs didn't talk or even get along well. Very unhappy place to work!"
bad,The company doesn't do well with training and giving there employees the tools they need to succeed. There management needs to be more hands on in day to day operations.
bad,"Come in and take calls. Each call was different. My customer service skills greatly improved here. Management is very weak, almost no power at all. More of a guide than anything else. Co-workers were hit and miss. Many were very stressed. Hardest part was having to deal with customers you wanted to be fair and nice with, but policy stopped you from being fair with them. Most enjoyable part were the benefits."
bad,A typical day is usually unbearable with hundreds of calls waiting in the call que. Understaffed that's why their is so much available overtime in every position. They offer health rewards for physical exams and weight training and not smoking. ok health and dental vision insurance best part of the job is the weekly paychecks and they do not micro manage
bad,I worked for ADT for two years. Only got one raise the whole time I worked there for some extra training. The calls keep coming in. They never stop. The customers are mostly rude and uneducated about how the alarm system works. If you are a single person I would advise working there for no more than two years then move on. No room for advancement and the company changes procedures on a daily baisis.
bad,"Con's outweighed the pro's. "
bad,"Training is lacking on product.  You learn by making mistakes.  The management is micro.  You have two ""come to Jesus talks"" daily.  They make you come into call night until 8:00 p.m.  This is a 100% commission job and the management is constantly on you about getting new sales.  You might drive to four different cities with people no showing for the appointments.  It is against the rules to call your appointments before you show up for the appointment.  The people that schedule your appointments are across the nation and have zero clue as to driving time.  You may get one hour driving time for a two hour drive.  The mileage allowance that they give you is insufficient.  YOU WILL WORK 12 hour days with one day off.  You are expected to also work that day off on occasion.  Management does not care about you.  They also changed my commission structure four times in one year.  Very confusing."
bad,"A typical day would be to provide callers with a list of customers to contact for security services.  "
bad,This was not a good job to most that worked there I started with a training class of 32 only 22 showed up on the first day due to the **** you have to go through during the background check that was in may of 2013 by Aug there were 9 of us left because everyone quit and once I saw that even the managers and trainer had left I knew I had to do something now a lot of my former co workers text me and ask if I can get them on at my new job they literally have a training class every week they only pay 8.50 because it is commission but they tax the **** out of the commission there is money to be made but you have to work crazy to get a decent commision also they place you were they need you so someone can come in two months after you and get a better shift if you need something quick it is great but be prepared to be there forever in order to move up some like it but most don't
bad,"Typical Day: 8:00-10:00 Making pestering phone sales calls for two hours (highly ineffective in terms of garnering actual sales, it's more about free phone advertising for ADT than anything else). "
bad,I would not reccommend working at this company as a sales associate. The leads are outdated with wrong phone numbers and do not calls. Not reccomended.
bad,"A typical day at work begins at 5AM and ends at 1:30PM calling out to 50-75 customers per day regarding their alarm systems. I learned about several different systems during training although when I arrived to the floor, I only needed knowledge for one. The people that I worked with, some were friendly, some were stubborn and mean, and most of them seemed to come to work to keep drama going. Since I've been employed there, there has been 8 fights on the premises. The job itself was simple and that was probably the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,If you produce you will always have a job.
bad,There is little to no product training. Teamwork is non existent. The benefits are good.
bad,The management was very poor passing on orders from Senior Management without looking into the affect on staff your individual job role you never felt secure at any moment the site could be moved or your post made redundant and guess what it was by a gay bandit that came in and moved everything I just hope they got rid of him next 🤔
bad,"it's a good place to work, if you just like to work just to pay the bills. no room for advancements. management could pay more attention to employee health and well being rather then wanting to meet numbers each month to get their bonus."
bad,It’s not worth the pay nor the time  ADT collections department sucks tremendously 3 months working there and I disliked it something I won’t advise anyone to do or work for.
bad,On boarding was a joke. Worked out of cafeteria for over a month as no desk available using my personal computer to do required training as company computer was never ordered nor company phone which working in IT is standard. Never reimbursed for my personal phone usage. Poor training for devices for job. Management didn't seem to care nor make any resolutions. Requirements for the job where sketchy at best. Hopefully that has changed but I wouldn't bank on it.
bad,"There are a lot of wheels turning within ADT that never go anywhere. Reorganization is frequent and common place. Many employees have had the same or more number of different bosses as the number of years they’ve worked there. "
bad,"Good coworkers, minimal work."
bad,"This job was by far one of the more challenging i have had. "
bad,"Stable workplace for someone who loves collecting, but isnt a place to put in too much time due to lack of support trying to rise in the company. They try to bring morale up with games and prizes but ultimately how a person is treated weighs more."
bad,"I work at ADT for less than a year. It was a joke! They treat you like trash. Make you do exams during training and if you don’t reach the average they desire they will fire you. Manager are jokes, they don’t do much and are not serious. One of the manager had an affair with  an employee and fired her when things didn’t work out. If you get hired through an agency your job is at risk everyday. If you get hired through the company you’re still at risk but you can easily get away with stuff.. the employees are nice but do not tell your business"
bad,Territory development is vital at this job.  The commission only structure makes it to where yu need to work twice as hard to achieve a livable salary.
bad,Working for ADT after the corporate takeover of Broadview Security (formally Brinks Home security) was like being required to be a robot. I was made to feel like a number as opposed to being a human being.
bad,"ADT is not a good place to work if you're looking for career advancements and if you have a family such as children, spouse, or if you are in school, or even just have a life outside of work at all. They are not flexible with their schedules at all. They are not understanding if you have emergencies, or even health issues. They feel that their pay rates should compensate you for anything you have in your life other than the job itself. They are only empathetic towards their customers and not at all towards their employees."
bad,"When we were bought by ADT the moral at our office was terrible.  They let go people every 6 months so you never knew when your time was up.  My manager was amazing but that changed to someone managing me from another city which was terrible.  The lack of communication was horrible.  We had to learn a new system which was fine but the training was terrible, we had to ask repeatedly for training."
bad,"Disconnect from senior leadership to the field employees.  Poor integration through P1 merger with many frustrated employees and customers.  Very competitive and somewhat cut throat culture where managing perception outweighs productivity.  "
bad,"ADT boasts that the company culture is all about it's employees and customers, but in reality they only care about the bottom line...money. The dept I worked in did not handle cust calls, and we were told we would not have to...which is the only reason I, and several other employees, took the position. Of course that changed to our dept would only be back up one day a week, then only in the mornings on certain days, to eventually staying logged in at all times. We did not receive training to handle customer calls but were told if we can help them do, and if not then transfer them to the proper dept...which only made the hold time that much longer for the customer, and made them even more frustrated. We were also expected to meet not only our dept metrics, but also the call-taking metrics...again, without proper training. It is understandable the company would eventually want all depts to assist in the cust care experience, but employees  expect them to be honest and truthful about the transformation, especially when those depts have been told all along they would not be affected. What started out as a fun place to work, never feeling micro-managed, and a place you did not mind getting up in the mornings to go to, turned into such a morale lowering place. ADT does not realize they had some really good and dedicated employees...and they probably never will."
bad,Everyday I spend two hours telemarketing and five hours outside sales in local business community. It is difficult for new hires to maintain their monthly bills on 100% commission salary.
bad,"ADT offers great training for new employees.  They are a very old company, established and offer products and services for both commercial and residential customers."
bad,"I enjoyed working for ADT before it was bought out by Protection One. After the buy out, the procedures of the FSC changed drastically.  The job was very repetitive and our other job duties had been taken away from us.  Representatives are now being trained to do additional job duties that are very stressful and lack training and are not being compensated for this extra work. This company no longer puts its employees first plus job advancement was rare."
bad,Transitioning in and out of mergers negatively impacts stability and market focus/direction. Workplace culture has not evolved in decades. Most enjoyable part of the job is having the freedom to setup/approach each day based on priorities establish through direct interaction with prospects (Salesforce CRM)
bad,The most difficult part about this job is not being trained properly but you are expected to handle the call and not transfer. The amount of transfers and the time you place people on hold are always in your face. It's tough to help someone when you aren't trained.
bad,You had to be quick on your feet and have the ability to learn on your own. The benefits and overtime made the work environment a lovely place to work.
bad,"It is an unstable organisation at this time with a complete disconnect between upper management down to field techs and CSRs. "
bad,"Management is very inflexible.  Policies are rigid.  Personal issues, medical problems, and family needs are not a priority.  Some opportunity for advancement but like most corporate jobs its very political and based mainly on likability.  Would not recommend this job to anyone.  If you need a 3-6  month fix maybe try it out but don't put all your monkeys in one barrel.  This place is not professional and the hours are long and arduous.  Again, management is very underqualified and almost absent most of the time.  Find a better job, if need go to another city.  This one is for the birds."
bad,"If you don't mind not being happy then Adt in the Irving call center is the perfect job for you, Adt is in a losing battle with customers there's to many options and Adt way to expensive"
bad,"This was a fun place to work, it had a great atmosphere most people laughed and had positive outlooks on everything, I had my issues with on co-worker but I just avoided any situation that wasn't work related. She has worked there for 20+ years before I was hired and we just had very different personalities. I got a lot great with my boss, we are still friends to this day. It was a great experience for my first admin job, I did learn a lot."
bad,"Mala forma de expresarse los gerentes hacia los empleados, con presión constante y sin motivación."
bad,"A typical day at the control room was,monitoring the activations from 06h00 to 18h00.During the day activations come through 1 by 1 to 20 by 20 every second.I learned how to be patient with clients and how to listen to a client in distress.The people i worked with were normal people trying to make a living.the hardest part of the job was to hearing that a client was shot while the response was seconds away or hearing that a response officer was shot while responding to an activation.The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to different people and helping in terms of dealing successfully with there different types of queries or problems and also knowing that ive managed to help a person in a difficult position or situation and most importantly hearing them(clients) phone in to thank the person who help them in a time of need."
bad,"Hardest part is the scheduling. The training and product knowledge is  key -  head managment is very demanding and makes it almost impossible to get or obtain objectives.   Not recommened !!! - "
bad,"Having worked 28 years in a company, every day continues to be a learning experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when customer's experience is a success and at times could be a challenge trying to keep a client who might have had issues along the way."
bad,"In at the office at 7:45"
bad,"A typical day at work involved taking non stop inbound phone calls. I learnt a lot from this role including skills such as prioritising customer needs, ability to multi task etc."
bad,"Company offered good pay, but often required too much time from you everyday. Common to work 12-14 hours each day not counting commute time back home. "
bad,"If you're looking for great benefits this is a good job but you must be prepared for loads of middle management.  The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing generally."
bad,While working with ADT I was happy knowing People was able to live a relaxing life and didn't have to worry about intruders.
bad,"Company does not care about your personal life and expects you to putting in all the hours of your week toward work."
bad,"This position requires formidable self-discipline and motivation, well-organized and flawless multitasking,, and a tireless commitment to the ongoing process of creating and sustaining leads and promotional partnerships."
bad,"•	Responsible for all residential and commercial inbound phone calls. "
bad,ADT is an excellent home security company/product to choose from however the only problem with the company is that the reps are constantly micromanaged and do not have any time for family or even a personal life. If you enjoy door knocking and cold calling then this place is for you if you are not willing to take risks then this company  is not the avenue you want to pursue a career with
bad,ADT has been a good company to work for over the years. I have encountered some great leadership styles and have been encouraged to go to the next step with fantastic mentorship. You will meet some great people that will help you through the never ending daily changes.
bad,"It has it's challenges when the dialer go down and it is at the end of the month and it is needed to meet the monthly service level. "
bad,"I would love the company if it were more employee oriented. I feel that the company is a strong company, but there are a lot of areas that need to be fixed. The pay is good for the work that I do."
bad,"The start of the day usually is meeting at the corporate office about the daily sales goals and quota that need to be made. Then we would  break off into groups to go to different territories of the city and go knock on doors to sale security or if you had any leads you would go meet with leads first. "
bad,Wouldn't recommend it . I hated it. Very lazy people and they hold you accountable for what they should help you with. Wasn't willing to work around my schedule.
bad,"Training is very poor. Very convoluted and difficult to understand. Outdated software. Pay is very low for what they expect from employees. As for perks, the pto is decent. Compared to other call centers, this place is a disaster."
bad,"Cold calling, outside sales, door to to door. Alot of driving. On going training with new products as they came along.a"
bad,Management requirements made work life stressful. Good health benefits.
bad,Responsible for 9 Commercial sales consultants as well as 7 small business consultants.
bad,Company doesn't believe in work/life balance.  Dealing with sales reps could be frustrating.  Only dealt with internal customers.  Managers play favorites.
bad,"Poor management,no support,only chart numbers driven and only focusing on pushing their workforce to meet those numbers to get their bonuses.Technicians are on their own,managers did not answer calls or messages,tech support are rude and takes long times to answer,equipment are ok,company want to charge for batteries even when customer have that included on maintenance plan,problem solving numbers cannot be achieved by replacing parts with poorly refurbished parts/devices."
bad,It’s ok lots of ot. I liked the job but nothing is never good enough such as requirements always changing. Due to being tech support you have the task of all departments.
bad,ADT changed a lot and to me and it's just not the same anymore! It's always too busy and there not enough time in a day to get everything done. The staff and the technician that I worked with was the best part of my day and I miss them very much.
bad,"Convincing clients to buy the product you selling"
bad,"ADT was a rewarding experience in and of itself. I learned a lot from their training program, and was in the field, selling with confidence within a month. Management was lacking, and it felt like being thrown to the wolves at times. Because of authorized dealers, the company provided leads were hard to come by, and sometimes when the appointment came about, the lead was already a customer!"
bad,"Unprofessional coworkers and enviroment ( feels like high school) . All the desks are broken and dirty. The calls are non stop and the expectations are impossible.  Basically come in work yourself to death leave and repeat. Open  24/7 must work all holidays and weekends. And there is NO dress code people come in like they just rolled out of bed. "
bad,I loved ADT as a company but the atmosphere over the years deteriorated. They began to hire operators the were immature and put in place managers that weren't properly trained to deal with the real issues. I love upper management. Tim Whall is an excellent CEO and he cares as much about his employees and he does his customers.
bad,"The six day week work schedule, late hours, being on call for customers, sales representatives and/or management can take a toll on some individuals if they are not prepared or don't have support. If fully staffed and new hires trained it becomes a little more manageable."
bad,"The people and the atmosphere where OK, it came down to a lack of give a sh++ for your personal or mental well being and it solely is just based on numbers. The sales for adt seem not to be there do to competition and I had to knock doors and find my own business. I found it hard to rely on a company that is going down and I make 100% commission."
bad,"Vehicles, computers, tools, uniforms, and equipment provided. Management and dispatch is friendly. Benefits are good. Long days,long drives and split day offs."
bad,"I started at one alarm company and in my 4 years it changed hands 3 times."
bad,working as a door to door salesman can prove as a very rewarding feat however the job demands a lot of work and practice outside of work. I also believe it requires a certain type of personality to work long term as it is too full of rejection for each personality type. Sadly I did not continue this job as I felt that I did not connect with the culture and did not believe in the product that I was selling and therefore felt i was taking advantage of people by making a sale.
bad,"Outside sale representatives compete with the dealer program as well as competitors.  This is a commissioned only position but the pay plan is very strong. New employees receive poor training therefore the turnover is huge. Everything is controlled by management like high school so, if you're popular you'll be fine. That is until the manager changes and you need a new clique. There are much worse companies to work for and many of your co-workers are great people. But, things do change daily and you can be rewarded for performance in a 9:00 meeting and coached at 3:00 the same day. They are squeezing every dime out in order to re-sell again."
bad,"At ADT they really make you work for every dime. On the one hand, if you're a workaholic or identify as some kind of beast of burden, you'll make bank and have a fruitful career working here. On the other, if those don't apply to you, you'll have a few exhausting but fulfilling months, maybe a year or two, before you either become totally numb and are just working to keep your stats meeting their brutal criteria, or you're driven to leave. "
bad,"ADT is a great company, they put a lot of work on management and the expectation is that you work 24 /7. I enjoyed the 18 years that I worked for ADT."
bad,"Good company in normal expected transition after breaking away from Tyco.."
bad,"I was very disappointed by how ADT treated their customers, did not acknowledge their employee's talents and had a buddy system within management and picked favored the certain employees."
bad,"ADT is a name that has been around for 140 years and is trusted worldwide.  The Personal Emergency Response System is a great product but receives no public marketing, ie; Television spots or ads in newspapers and magazines.  The sales are very slow due to the fact of poor marketing and an abundance of competitors in the market."
bad,Till they restructured the commission plan and everyone got a paycut.  Mandatory Overtime everyday for 3 years. Then they cut everyone's hours. Some managers would care about their reps. Others wouldn't. Constantly shifting metrics. Requiring us to take more calls and convert more sales and paying us less.
bad,Ok Position too many demands and requirements for little pay.  Overall great learning experience but the PAY SUCKS and how you have to earn a decent check
bad,Management isnt the best. You always know where you stand with job security due to point system. QA is good but not consistent. Best paying job I have had to date. Sales was not what I am cut out for.
bad,while the pay was good and some of the benefits the place was a dull place to work most of management looked like they were forced to be there and looked as though they couldn't be bothered. The 6 week rota was no help either as could not plan things consistently.
bad,"I communicated a lot with tons of people that worked for the same company as I. I learned and improved on my communication skills. Co-workers at this company we're awesome, the hardest part of the job was trying to close a sale. Well, when I first started. The enjoyable part of this job is communicating with everyone."
bad,"My typical day at ADT consisted of answering phone from clients and taking payments and redirecting them to correct departments. I had to learn the in's and out's of alarm systems and how some of it worked. I also had to learn Mainframe and AS400, excel, and ADT own personal website (both of which I already knew how to use). The job itself was not bad. Answering phone calls and the daily tasks are all normal and what you would do in any call center. But the managers and the sales officers and sales execs make the job 100x harder then it needs to be. Half of your calls end up being clients who called in because something was going wrong with their alarm or the install of their alarm that was agree'd to in their contract but that was not explained to them by the sales exec so they would actually be able to make the sale. We in the call center are not allowed to handle those calls. We are required to hand those calls off to a sales office by transfer only (calling the sales office transferring the call and hanging up, not waiting for somebody to answer and explain why that person is calling, and not supposed to push any prompts for the client) or we can direct them to the sales exec by giving them the phone number only not transferring. Usually when client is transferred to the sales office they end up back at our call center by pushing the wrong prompts. Or they will try to call the sales exec and get no answer and call us back anyways. This ends up increasing our call volume and then the client is upset which makes the phone calls longer. A lot of times the client refuses to"
bad,Fast paced. Numbers driven cold call and self generation is important.
bad,ADT was a good experience however it's time for me to work in my field as a phlebotomist.
bad,"I was let go due to a lake of work. Overall the job was easy, as far as effecting efficient repair service, however it lacked what I prefer as mentally challenging."
bad,"Salario bom, ambiente bom, liderança fraca, não lutava para estimular os funcionários, equipamentos utilizados eram ultrapassados. ( computadores, hardwares, telefones e etc..)"
bad,Cold calling businesses on the phone and in person required daily. Compensation isn't enough to get by unless you are well over your monthly sales quota.
bad,This company cares more about profit than anything else. I have worked for this company for 3 years in some areas I see improvement but in other more important areas its years of no change or progress. If you need a job that pays okay until you can do better this is the place.
bad,un día típico en el trabajo : nos apuraban demasiado con las ventas y la gente no quería poner adt
bad,"It's been 20 years and I'm sure things have changed, I've heard that many of the managers and supervisors have retired since I've been there and their business has changed with Tyco"
bad,I loved my immediate manager. She to make sure you have what you need to do the job but upper management sucks. The training period and what they want you to know in a short period of time is not realistic. They have a lot of products that don't go together which makes it very stressful when asking for assistance.
bad,ADT has great benefits to offer. The training is excellent but room for advancement only happens if you are friends with current management staff. If you do not fit in with them then you will not have opportunity to advance regardless of knowledge or ability.
bad,"A good place to work at, lots of available over time. Room for advancement but very difficult to be promoted by management. Promote more people walking in the door than those who have worked there for years."
bad,"You may walk into a slow paced day or you may walk into a hectic evening with calls back to back. It's stressful because even though you are there to help people, for me I couldn't get over the people I couldn't help."
bad,"This isn't an easy job by no means. You either sink or you swim, you have to push sales everyday and you can't wait for anyone. It's tough to have a life outside of this is you're not meeting your numbers, it also helps to have a supporting family member or at least a bank account that can handle your slow weeks or months."
bad,"we have normal days in where we work without much stress, but during month end where target has to be met for Billing we push beyond limit."
bad,"A typical day at work is a true grind. The classroom training is mediocre, most useful information will be provided be senior agents but once one starts to get to know their way around things become a bit more routine. There is literally no time to draw breaths between calls because the call volume is so heavy. One can expect a manager to come flying around the corner if one so much even thinks of hitting the aftercall button. Agents are expected to perform a truly large range of functions and calls generally come in randomly.  The technicians that one interacts with are poorly educated and have abysmal organizational skills. It can literally take nearly two minutes to determine the purpose of the call. The ability to multi-task is essential. The management has the potential to be helpful but it will depend on the situation and their mood for the day. The workplace culture is bizarre............. There's pretty much no other way to say it. The troubleshooting aspect of the job is probably what I would consider the most enjoyable. It is satisfying to work through and solve a problem successfully."
bad,"Company has a great product. Upon hire you are set up for success with intensive and ongoing training however those meetings shorten daily lead generation expectations being tied up in the office several times a week. Management expectations  for commission only sales rep are micromanaged, adding hourly management to the point of taking selfies from your current locations. . Employee handbook states unit expectations, and management involvement to assist with discounting and approval of certain sales. Management at times were unavailable to assist. This job is for seasoned sales personnel with 5 yr plus experience in sales. Not recommend for inexperienced sales person"
bad,they where not up font with me about what it was that id be doing not very accommodating iv sent meany email with no response about changing departments
bad,Working here is great when provided with good leads however security is an event driven industry that leads are not evenly distributed by upper management. If management sees your potential they will season you with better leads.
bad,ADT is a great place to work and make good money if you have absolutely no kids and no other outside responsibilities. Their attendance policy is no way conducive to an employee with a family.
bad,"company has poor sales strategy. No support for outside sales team."
bad,"Supportive Management "
bad,"Extensive training for your position and excellent supervisors at the Knoxville call center plus the break rooms have sports playing 24/7, but upper management seems to be more concerned with the almighty dollar instead of customer satisfaction and security. The policy changes are so frequent that by the time you've grasped everything they change it again. Mostly have to work nights, weekends and all holidays. They have shift differentials that will compensate you better provided your shift starts after 12pm and you work both Sat and Sun. I worked from 11am-9pm Mon, Thurs, Fri & Sat so I was only paid base rate of 11.57 per hour. The HR recruiter that I spoke with didn't state that in the interview so I was led to believe I was going to be fairly compensated for the job. Long story short I quit. I'd rather dig ditches for dimes than go back."
bad,"You get minimal Jobs to go on, you must create you own. 100 Miles Per day to travel, Lots of hours knocking on doors.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
bad,"Prepared, a positive attitude and willingness to get the task done at hand."
bad,Nice organization with good oppertunities to work and grow.
bad,Full responsibility for running a R 100 million/annum Branch
bad,I did not get the training from the manager before he left for a promotion. The money could be really good if i had a complete understanding on how to max out my comp plan. There is no leadership in our office since they both got promoted and there is no one to backfill.
bad,"Overall, good company to work for, good compensation for contractors. Senior Management needs to have more structured approach to management."
bad,Had a customer expose themselves to me when I was in their home and the company was more concerned about if the customer was going to get security then my well being. Enough said that sums up how you will be treated at ADT.
bad,ADT is a large company that is ALL about the money.
bad,"This was a wonderful learning experience and provided me with a good stepping stone to grow upon. In the location I was placed, Upper Management was weak and had much room to grow."
bad,"Typically I take 50-75 calls a day, I create a lead on customers and either set up an appointment or transfer them to sales rep, and I also answer any questions they may have.I've learned great things about security systems. There's not anything hard about my job, its fairly simply once you get the hang of it, the enjoyable part of my job is talking to different people from all around the world."
bad,When I was working there I didn't get paid unless I made a sale and be prepared to be walking all day and long car rides with a bunch of people. They will tell you after a certain time you can start making an hourly wage but its not likely.
bad,"I've worked at ADT for a little over a year now. I was doing very well as a customer serivce rep. The job is just like any other CSR job, need good listening skills, need to pick up ne info on product quickly to help customers etc. "
bad,ADT is the best in home and small business security. But they have a million miles to go in field training.  They put you in front of a computer for a month and then put you in the field on your own.  No field training! With all the turn over in the first 60 days after computer training you would think someone would get it. You can not sale the best products with out having the support to do so. The job is all COMMISSION! No sale no pay. No support no sale. Get it.
bad,"fue un trabajo monótono, mal pago, y un clima laboral un poco hostil."
bad,i learn a lot about handling a pressure communicating with client  and  the salary was  a good salarie  working enveroment was good and we were learning everyday
bad,Tienen que ser mas simpatico ala hora de contratar alas personas .
bad,"ADT is a place to have a job, I wouldn't consider it to have a career there. Work as much OT as possible but continue to look for another job. ADT is a relaxed environment but don't get too comfortable."
bad,"will stab you in the back if you make more money than management then all the referrals you work hard for, they take them and give em to other workers to split your pay with ones that are struggling."
bad,Management could have be a lot better. Staffing is horrible and the building is discussing. Every manager had a problem with doing their job. They are the worst company to work for!!
bad,"It was a type of job that you had to  be awake for. No time for sleeping. Had to make sure that correct products go out of despatch. When receiving stock,you need to know what code is coming in &  how many."
bad,"Working for ADT was more stressful and challenging than I could have imagined. Some days not able to take a lunch along with driving around the whole county and sometimes being late to appointments due to ADTs scheduling system. I learned how to work with all different types of personalities in a professional business setting and well as having some of the best co-workers I have ever worked with. The management on the Sales side of ADT needs work but the Operations aspect of ADT seems to work and run a lot smoother. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of protecting families from the dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Fire in a Home, and Developing Custom Surveillance and Security Systems for customers to add or give back piece of mind. One of the hardest part of my jobs was dealing with close-minded management personnel."
bad,Its a good feeling to help someone feel safer in their own home/business.. the management needs to be refreshed...ASAP
bad,Contract was terminated without any notice to employees. Enjoyed installing home security alarms and customer satisfication.
bad,"Everything is about numbers. Very quick to point fingers.  Used to do things as a team such as lunches and fundraisers, but not anymore.  The job itself is not bad, but being such a worldwide company there are mistakes that happen on the corporate level that make others jobs difficult and sometimes can cause to lose customers."
bad,"if you dont know how to work with people know how to speak with client ,know how to to do the work good the job is not for you, YOU ARE WORKING WITH PEOPLES LIVES , so you better know what you are doing . have to be and have TOTAL FOCUS"
bad,"Commission only is difficult. However you know there is truly a need for the product. Therefore, it is worth it. The sales procedures became way better after I left. And my manager had a crack addiction, so I had to quit."
bad,"Buen ambiente, pero no se me daba bien vender, nos dieron poco tiempo para poder hacer una venta, aunque comprobé que no era lo mío"
bad,hard company to work for due to people already having a negative mindset toward the company.
bad,Management can sometimes be understanding. The turnover rate is high. Easy to leave but not enough pay for the responsibilities. Everyone I worked with were good to be around some of which I'm still antiquated with today. most enjoyable would be the learning. Learning a new field and new software.
bad,On-site consultant to customers.  Learned to provide security analysis of both home and businesses to keep their properties safe and protected from potential problems with both security and fire safety.
bad,Daily interaction with prospective customers in person and over the phone.
bad,"•	Receive inbound calls/ make outbound calls"
bad,"It is run like many call centers are in regards to checking operator quality, reliability, call duration, and alarms per hour. As long as you are able to meet and exceed those metrics then you will do well."
bad,To many pages just to apply for one position makes not worth the time
bad,"There are some good aspects of working for company such as ADT, however, they're outweighed by the bondage and weight of having to deal with the policies and procedures that change daily.  The security or assurance in knowing that you have a place of longevity and reliability in the workplace is a far feched vision for the fellow employees in my department.  I just feel managers should be more in tune with their teams and work with them in prospering not only in the company but in the life of the company as an entire organization."
bad,I enjoyed my time there but family obligations bought me back to NC
bad,"ADT itself is a great company to work for. However, the management at the Tampa Small Business is very lacking. You can do very well as long as you are properly trained, coached, and assisted."
bad,Great for a first job able to make an career if you get in with the correct workers
bad,Muy poco compromiso con los sueldos y lugar de trabajo empresa que no cumplia con los pagos de sueldo al dia
bad,• Facilitate inbound telephone calls to support the field support technicians
bad,A very confused organization led by people that dont know the industry
bad,"high pressure job, technical, very strict on sick time. Everyone who works there hates it"
bad,"the job can be very stressful, because we aren't properly trained. rules and procedures change daily, and no one is ever on the same page."
bad,"Arrive, sit in chair for hours with nothing to do but look out for insidences. End of shift, walk though all of church (4 floors) turning off all lights and locking all doors."
bad,"Fast-paced back to back calls, help to save customer life by troubleshooting their alarm system, calling 911, fire or medical..scheduling on site job and assisting with sale, upgrade and  billing."
bad,"Customers can be very rude, but the people working there are very comforting and helpful. The pay isn't bad for a call center, but outs hard getting time off when you need it."
bad,Check and clean dispensary machine change and replace combo locks change out broken drawers locks clean vaults Doors make sure alarms systems was working in the end ADT was broke and lie to by CEO who was latter jail for slealing from combany
bad,"advising the customer on the best direction their can take according  to the quary they have called for."
bad,"They cost me about $5,000. They don't accept a 2 week notice. You leave that day. Well if you don't work, you don't get paid. Management wasn't very good. Speaking of management, you'll have about 5 bosses. More bosses than sales rep. makes perfect sense ADT."
bad,"Great HR Team, fast paced and was properly taught new task.  The culture was well balanced.  I learned many new things as a HR Assistant.  Management did turn over a few times in a very short period of time."
bad,"Very impersonal, favoritism plays a big role in advancements and success. I made great money with great benefits however you are only a number and the managers are not very educated on policies."
bad,"Within the last couple years the company has been bought out and management changed as well as protocol to our daily duties. wanted us to do more...& more work, but with no extra time to do it in. Some days were good, ups and downs like any other job, up until the last two years. Liked what i was doing, just didn't like how it was being done."
bad,"ADT has gone through some changes this past year but things are stabilizing and it is still a great place to work. The new CEO and leadership seems to have a focus on improving customer experience and service, which is a direction that I feel will help the organization. The environment is one where everyone works hard, but there is still a great work/life balance."
bad,"I worked at ADT for years starting in billing then becoming a retention rep. When I went to retention, the pay was amazing with a great monthly bonus but over time things have gotten worse and worse. They push unrealistic goals upon their employees now that make things completely miserable, and have become so strict and micromanaging with a new script that they try to force upon everyone. Also, it's near impossible to change your shift. I finally got the courage to quit because I could tell that the changes were only going to get worse, and being acquired by another company would contribute to that."
bad,a typical day at work is always a happy day for me. i work with joy and fun. i learned that hard work pays. its good to work for something you enjoyed doing than working just because you needed money to keep moving. management was okay. everyone interact well enough. they were fun to be with. you should be prepared to travel a lot.  knowing places have never been to. it was fun anyways
bad,Great place to work.  The 100% commission plan is very challenging to meet on a monthly basis if your trying to support a family.
bad,Not much room for growth. Pay for performance. For now at least. I like my managers. But don't get paid enough.
bad,"this was my first job out of high school and let me tell you one thing, IT SUCKED!!! You sit on a phone all day saying the same exact things everytime you make a call. Repetitive and no chance to really get to know co-workers"
bad,Answered 200 plus calls per day. Assisted with emergencies. Updated all accounts and noted all calls. Pay was basically minimum wage with no opportunity for a raise.
bad,"regular,debido a muchas falencias operacionales."
bad,Extremely flexible schedule. Friendly environment and most seem to genuinely care. I am lucky to have met the individuals that I have met here and majority have treated me as family. Goals are reachable and Team Leaders are there to help you to reach those goals.
bad,Helping customer with questions and concerns about their alarm was really enjoyable.
bad,If you dont mind working in a stressful call center where the metrics youre being rated on are not in your control then you will be fine. There is a lot of overtime available. Managers are very nice and you can talk to them with no problem.
bad,"The job is 100% commission, even if you stick it out...it's hard to make ends meet. "
bad,"ADT was a great place to get a feel for the call center atmosphere. They had room for advancement and full 40 hour work weeks. The only downsides were that the management of different teams did not communicate well with each other, and we were frequently short managers making it difficult to satisfy upset customers. The other issue was the company is having trouble staying afloat and because of that they would let go groups of people 10-15 at a time so they would not have to promote them, and could bring in new trainees."
bad,was okay working there but management was horrible because of how they treat the works.
bad,"Good work place, lots of cld calling for prospect, compensation is a little low in comparison for all that is expected, lots of driving around and customers no-show."
bad,Been with ADT for about 2 months. It's a good place to work. Time fly's and people are willing to help each other out. Here's my problems with this company. It's all give no take. Make you work 2 hours of OT when needed with little to no notice. If you don't sign up they just add it to your schedule. They also don't let you add it where it works for you has to be what's best for them. If you miss time or a day it goes against your time and they take it out of your PTO time as well. Problem I have here is life happens and we get penalized no matter what. But when they need you to work OT we have no choice but to do it or that also goes against your time. You get 80 hours to miss after training before getting fired and you get 10 hours of PTO per month. Be a little more understanding special to employees that don't miss time or best there tale when they are there. Work life is great you do your 8 hour day and go home. 2 days off per week always back to back. Holidays off unless you really want to work. as much OT as you want. Again OT must be at there need not what's best for your life schedule. I like it here I just don't like the do for me but we will never do for you
good,N/A I have nothing to say not good with organization skills and or communication which I feel is mandatory when working for a company other wise all fails
good,Never Had A Chance To Really Advance There. There Was No Base Pay Either. So If You Didnt Sell You Didn't Receive A Check.
good,This company was great at first but started to change a lot of what they said in training. There products were way over priced and my manager would send me 50 to 100 miles out of my territory and half the time the customer only wanted info. They wanted too many prospects a day and too man SGLs and if you didn't make that then they take you off the list for customers.
good,"Learned fast, was pushed to continue learning and grow at a fast pace.  Worked on AS400 and Telemar, hardest part of the job was the lack of coordination throughout management."
good,"ADT > I worked in retention. The management is making these unreal goals to accomplish. You can not succeed by their goals and expectations. "
good,"I worked at ADT between the ages of 19-21 (2005-2007). It was my 1st professional job and it taught me alot about interoffice workings and ""corporate america"". I worked in the call center which is open 24/7-365 days a year so there is no such thing as weekends or holidays off in the call center (unless your off days happens to fall on that day and/or date). "
good,"Had trouble advancing, most jobs went to either younger or darker applicants."
good,"Staffs are nice, hard-working, management does not share much information, no progression, difficult life balance for long time planning, customers are mostly angry, due to lack of support, the technicians need to pay attention to details with a dedication to service, management needs to open up more avenues for growth, people need to enjoy what they do for better productivity."
good,"Product is great, customers are good in that they are concern about their families and their homes. There is a need for this product. However, the culture is so behind in the times. It's like a free for all in day to day production. Process of ""how"" to succeed are sometimes spoken. You are expected to know how to exist in this culture. It's a shame because with the right leaders it would be a GREAT environment."
good,"Long hours of work, no base pay, no support from your boss, co worker stealing sales, boss knows and covers plus makes you split your commission. Only good thing was I controlled my hrs."
good,ADT have changed a lot during my 11 years with the company unfortunately the morale here is very weak and the treatment of the employees has dropped.  I enjoyed working for ADT but the times have changed throughout the company.
good,"Its been around for a very long time, strong company background and name, but they just joined with another security company, brought all new management, starting changing too many things around. The team managers were put under enormous stress, many of them quit, there is a very high turn over rate at this company. They under pay customer service agents by at least 3-4 dollars per hour, as compared to other monitoring companies locally."
good,the company decided to go private and when they were bought out by Apollo Global management group. the decided to restructure the company and I feel are headed toward a call center inviorment
good,"false numbers, high pressure sales with dealers who use scare tactics to make a sale.  The company is trying to change but it may be to late....  I do love the fact that the company does help to save lives and is the best security company in the industry."
good,"ADT was a good company to work until new management took over and the company started to go down hill fast..."
good,Heavy customer contact and data entry.  High stressed environment.
good,"This public company is under constant restructuring and looses its way frequently.  They DO train their employees with industry leading resources. but a very adversarial work environment, reminiscent of the movie, Boiler Room of Glen Cary Glen Ross!"
good,The attitude from adt towards the techs in the field is pathetic. They put out poor equipment and blame the techs when things don’t work. Expect a lot out of you and don’t want to give anything in return
good,Unable to transfer sites even if you move. Treatment for ones who's been there for years. PTO is 12 hours every month on date of hire. No phones allowed
good,"ADT was Awesome till the pay cut in Jan 2018 lost 15 techs because of pay drop and lost General manager reason ukn started working more hours at a pace that i at age 53 could not keep up with the my manager had a problem with me so harassed me by phone and in person about my speed kept threaten me with termination so i e-mail corporate about hostile work environment so he did all by the book and pused me out that way,"
good,"The building had a bad atmosphere that spread to everyone.  Which keep you in a bad mood.  Supervisors wouldn't backup their employees.  If we decided to walk out the supervisors couldn't do our jobs.  Over worked us and didn't care if we were tired or if we had families to go home to."
good,"at one time this was THE place to work."
good,"too many management turnover, if you want to get paid, finding your own leads and not relying on the company leads is the way to go. You must sell 17 or more to get paid decent but the commission structure and the way you are being paid has gotten out of hand."
good,"ADT is your typical sales position with daily activity quotas and sales goals.  They will tell you that you can work 40 hours a week to get you in the door, but then that changes to mandatory 6 day work weeks and call nights until 8PM at night quickly.  The management is ignorant of the product for the most part and work 10-4 and no Saturdays.  The benefits are good and it you are beating your sales goals you can make a lot of money.  Oh, and training is laughable.  They constantly make changes to product and systems without letting the sales staff know."
good,"I think the day that ruined this company for me was Pioneer day 2014.  I was supposed to have the day off.  I was living in Clinton Utah by Hill Air Force Base.  I was in Ogden ready to watch the parade with my family when I started getting phone calls from our scheduling department.  The scheduled me for appointments in Spanish Fork, Lehi and Logan.  If you know Utah at all you know that this is a lot of travel in one day."
good,"The range of work is to much for the pay. The management team is not helpful and understanding to the employees.Observe and report suspicious activities."
good,"They are unbelievably stingy.  Also, which this is paradoxical I know, they want you to work all day all evening and some nights.  No field training, no bonus money, and like $40 a week in gas to run their ""appointments"". Stay thirsty my friends"
good,"You work 6-7 days a week. The pay can be good, but ADT allows customers to cancel everything for up to 6 months no questions asked. That means that you can have charge backs from a job you sold months before. You never know for certain what your paycheck will be. You are a number to them. Co-workers can be kind...if they are not in direct competition with you. Otherwise, watch your back. You are forced to attend a week long new hire training session that could be out of state. The training is a long, drawn out process that seems to waste a LOT of time. It could easily be done in a few days at your actual job location."
good,"The mornings would start with a 7:45 conference call reviewing your daily activity that was ,completely visible through Salesforce. Appointments were set as availability would allow per the company."
good,Total telamarketer company.management only cares about them self. If you like text messages 7 days a week then by all means feel free to work at ADT.
good,"In the beginning the job was fun and rewarding. After five years of working, the company got greedier and greedier by inflating sales goals to 3-times there original amounts, while at the same time decreasing compensation. They also continuously increased the range in which we drove to do jobs. Finally the lack of opportunity mixed with the inability to go to school while working for personal advancement caused me to quit. Also, the constant threats and badgering from managers was absurd."
good,Getting your job contracts for the day and usually working more than fifty miles away. Crawling in attics on hot summer days and dealing with customers who don't like you drilling holes in their walls when its part of the job.
good,Constantly working taking calls & putting in orders. Job wouldnt be a job without my coworkers. We always willing to help/ assist one another. The hardest part of the day is on month end close out. Calls are none stop on this day.
good,"Productive"
good,"The management team is under the gun, they will send you to a call and will have fixed the home before you arrive and never tell you"
good,Outbound call verifying if people or okay... toughest part of job is that it its very repetitive
good,We assisted customers with their storage needs and sold them moving and storage materials.
good,"i work shifts ..12 hours. 6 am to 6pm and 6 pm to 6 am ..i have learn to multi task, how to deal with clients complains.the hardest part of my job is when you are trying to assits an angry client.the other hardest part is the long hours i spend away from my familly"
good,"A typical Day at work at ADT - I would come in, log onto all of my systems and begin my phone calls to techinitans in LA to set their schedules and contact customers if a Technitian called out sick. Management was poor, the was a large turnover rate - Hardest Part of the Job was making sure I called every single customer before the end of their scheduled window-frame to let them know if a tech was going to run late. I had over 60 technitians and each one had 7-10 appointments a day. Very Fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is the bond I made with my techntians and service team managers, even when they are across the country. We would all help each other out."
good,good place to learn basic alarm systems and to go on with future abilities
good,The job is exciting but the overall balance and hours are stressing. Things change at minutes notice without any information provided.
good,"Good people to work for, good product, fair compensation"
good,"I scheduled service technicians to repair alarm systems, enjoyed working with most of the employees. Would prefer not to make any other comments"
good,"At ADT, I came ther as a temp to scan and upload documents that were being shipped to a storage location, in order for accessibility in computer system once they’ve been boxed and relocated. Papers were sorted, unstapled, scanned, stapled, documented on spreadsheets, and boxed for storage."
good,Working with pleasant co workers. Excellect company to work for.
good,"An average of 250 miles a day are put on my car, in the last 90 days I have driven over 30,000 miles. I am considered in the top 1% of the company in sales and my income is average. Upper management places extreme pressure on the sales team to produce even more with threats to be fired if you don't. Turn over within the company is crazy! This is a large company with ALOT of red tape to get through to get something done!"
good,"The security industry has changed, however ADT hasn’t got the memo. Ring doorbell integration or lack there of gives customers the perception of this service being unnecessary."
good,"Out of nearly eight years only first 2 years were happy ones Other years due to 5 manager changes,--- Who came and went.-- was enough to make your head spin ----Managers had no authority over other channels despite rampant invasion of clients and deals.."
good,Great stepping stone job. My manager hated me from day one. Other colleagues were very supportive. I was not measure by the content of my skills or character.
good,"ADT is a great company, but working for a dealer is not the way to go. I worked for Defenders/Protect Your Home and it was the biggest mistake of my life. Management is absolutely horrible and only care about making money. I was ""let go"" via text message from the regional manager. There is no work life balance and if you have a family, it is not the job for you!!"
good,"Mergers are very uncomfortable when speaking with management personnel."
good,ADT is a black hole with no room for advancement. No matter how good your numbers are it doesn't equate to more money or advancement in the company. As it stands we have been waiting a little over a year for a raise that has yet to come and we have not even been updated about it what so ever.
good,"Once you become Tier II Tech Support your days are pretty much spent doing the other departments work/fixing their mistakes. Rarely being able to take care of the customers who actually need your assistance, such as customers that have CCTV systems, Brivo systems etc."
good,Very fast paced work environment. Call volume matters more than anything else. Management can be good or bad. Rules change depending on the department. Relies too much on 3rd party vendors and authorized providers that provide awful customer service.
good,"If you are in tbe Residential side of this company, you are treated just above pond scum. Not sure how the management gets away with talking to the employees the way they do."
good,The main problem with ADT was you never knew what you were going to make from job to job. You could sell the same job 3xs and make 3 different amounts. All it took was an installer to complain that he needed a few more hours for the install and the commish got whacked. Being 100% commission this was particularly frustrating.
good,"The company is built on the ADT name, not the products. The promotions they have are bad and the MMR for each system is not competitive. Installers get screwed on the majority of jobs."
good,I've been here for many years and have seen barely any advancement within my building. They don't compensation you for your hard work properly and when asked for a raise you are given the run around. They are willing to let to do all kinds of work but will not give you your proper title nor pay.
good,"PROS , nao atrasa salario "
good,"Long Days Hard work Have to Be a hunter , daily meetings and focus on territory , and development o the sales agents under yourself , mentorship . And providing customers the opportunity to eel more safe ."
good,Management had always been poor. The manager did not know how to do any of the job tasks that their would assist to others. The management team was very cut throat and would lie on employees if it meant saving themselves.
good,"ADT needs a lot of work, ALOT, the management is more unorganized then HR and all CORP cares about is the money, If you have personal issues, just quit before you get FIRED"
good,"But it was a drag.Not that I don't appreciate the money, and the work, but the situation was just not pleasant. The workers are all cool, management is erratic, "
good,"This was a great company until management and compensation was changed, and opportunity became scarce.  This Position requires a great deal of independence and common sense, without it you will fail, because management is detached from the day to day process."
good,"Primer experiencia como telemarketer, y vendedora en un grupo muy ameno."
good,"Lots of driving, way more then they originally claimed. A lot of meaningless meetings and conference calls and day planning calls.  By the end of the day you wonder what time did i have to go out and sell.  Company basically cuts the field sales reps at the legs by selling through the 1800 line and using dealers.  Horrible customer service center, current customer always complained.  Tough environment to plow forward.  Recently merged with P1 not sure how that is working out."
good,"This is a company with a lot of really smart, caring employees. However the success of the company has been seriously hampered by poor customer relations and bad business decisions, that were seemingly made to improve out going executive payouts."
good,"Pulling files, purging closed accounts, making sure that pulled files are in alpha/numeric order before they are packed for shipping  lots of detail goes into security, fun co-workers, relocating files."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of talking to customers and resolving their issues over the phone. I would put my best foot forward and try to resolve issues with the alarm systems thus avoiding sending a technician. I've learned how to fix alarm systems and being empathetic to a customers frustration. Management was ok, I felt like management spent more time socializing than working, managers seem to lack knowledge and organization for team members. Managers left questions unanswered with unsure and ambiguous responses. When customers asked to speak to supervisors, supervisors would tell the team member to just transfer them to another department.  Hardest part of the job was getting customers to relax and explain the problem instead of having an unpleasant conversation. Also trying to get management to understand that little things such as a customers waiting time and a customer that had been given wrong instructions makes it so much harder for a team member who is knowledgeable, provide that customer with the right tools and advice effectively."
good,The new department manager for inbound ruined the morale of the entire site. It was an amazing place to work where I was excited to work everyday. It was a fun environment where we felt like a family. He was there for 5 months when I left. It was turned into a terrible place that was more focused on numbers and not the individual.
good,"Working in a call center can be great but can also get loud. Sometimes it was hard to hear your customer because the headsets were not that great. I loved it when I was in training, all the trainers I had were awesome and I had a great class but a lot of the class left before the training was even finished. Its hard being on the phone and staying in your cubicle for a long period of time, I'd rather be busy all the time and more hands on."
good,As an agent on the floor you are expected to log in and take calls at the start of your shift. Management is very stats orientated. You have to be hitting your numbers or they will write you up and fire you. They don't try to help you if you are having trouble. Most people are really nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is learning all the systems they require for you to learn.
good,Decent Job Horrible management not very good to there decent employees treated them badly
good,Un dia tipico llegar sentarse loguearse y empezar a recibir llamadas ofreciendo el servicio.Se aprende a usar un vocabulario preciso para interesarle a la gente y que te preste atencion. No tenia mucho contanto con dierccion ya que cuanto mucho alguna duda se hablaba con un supervisor. Mis colegas en su gran mayoria jovenes de mi edad entre 19 a 25 años muy buena onda todos con gran necesidad de trabajo. Lo mas dificil era lograr las entrevistas para hacer llegar un asesor a una visita tecnica por la inseguridad la gente desconfia y esto costaba lograr ventas y en otros casos por lo que fuera cuando el asesor llegaba muchas veces las ventas no se realizaban por que la gente no se decidia a comprar. Me gusto el adquirir un poquito mas de experiencia en otro rubro y conocer gente nueva y humilde
good,"Cut throat environment "
good,"Challenging but fun, responding to emergency calls promtly and effitiently,general office work, supervision of guarding officers, health and safety practice, protection of company equipmen, good vehicle meintenance,trip sheets and record keeping."
good,Had a good time there or a few years. Learned lots but project management for most managers was a joke.  Good project management skills are hard to come by and it seemed like quite a few of the managers were hired just for the sake of being there too darn long.  Learned lots of good things though and feel as though I appreciated my time with the company.
good,This was a challenging job but I did learn a lot. It was my foot in the door to where I am now.
good,"saiamos para vender de porta em porta, nao tinha horario de parar eramos explorados pois chegava a trabalhar 12 horas por dia e nao pagavam muito bem. no entanto a filial que eu trabalhava fechou as portas, por mau gerenciamento."
good,"Its a great place to work, if you do not have a personal life. The schedules rarely gets changed unless hyou have senority."
good,They are offering products that are completely obsolete. They went through too many acquisitions and cannot cope with the changes and the technology upgrades. Management is ineffective and invisible.
good,ADT is a large company and entry-level positions up to middle to entry-level management are not taken care of. The turn over is extremely high and that is because of pay and the culture.
good,Great camaraderie. Team Spirit. Employer was out of touch with competing market and.timing of outbound calls. Extremely short notice on shift changes. We would get calls in the am for afternoon shifts. Made work/life balance nearly impossible.
good,I work for ADT for approximately 2 years as a business Outside Sales Rep. The company does not pay base salary and the competition is very high. As a result it wasn’t unusual to have either little pay or no pay at all.
good,"ADT has great and bad perks. The great perks is the freedom to access the internet, commission and health benefits. The bad perks are the schedules, unprofessional Supervisors, hourly pay, and management. The management gossips, relys on senior reps for help, lie an say schedule changes are based on stats but really it's favoritism. I've put in multiple dept transfer forms and my supervisor would rather avoid me then tell me she won't sign them.  You are pressured to get sales and if you don't get atleast one for the day,  they automatically assume you did something wrong. The dept is basically retention; Relo has became a drop off dept , all depts (customer service, tech support, billing, pre-install...etc), cold transfers their calls to us and acct management is the laziest dept in the whole company. So yeah work there at your own risk."
good,Working in sales for ADT is a high-stress job that is very financially rewarding.  Management offered timely feedback and was fair. Opportunities for advancement seem to be more about who you know as opposed to what you know (highly political).
good,"Working with a right manager and have a fun team will make your life easier. In sales you never stop, and always remember to ask for referral when you closed a deal."
good,"The executive leadership micro-manages in the daily work. The ""culture"" is broken and requires a rejuvenation. The sr leadership team is out of touch."
good,"Outside Sales Reps are paid 100% commission.  We have to find our own leads 95% of the time.  They have inside sales teams that takes away from our productivity/Sales.  Not fair, feel like the step child.  Plus the installers can sell to our customers and they get the credit for it we don't, they are union and get paid a pretty hefty hourly rate.  It would be nice if us Sales Reps would get a SALARY plus commission.  Pay is unsteady, hard to budget.  Don't get paid until the job is installed so may have to wait to get paid for weeks even months is the job isn't completely installed, so beware if you are selling a ""prewire"" but don't get paid until the job is completely installed. You get mileage but its nothing great, like 12 cents a mile but its paid AFTER your commute miles are taken away each day."
good,Use to be an excellent experience but no any longer. Use to report to commercial department but now reporting to the Branch. Is not the ideal place for Commercial Business.
good,"Meh, not too impressed it’s an okay place to start at I believe. However if you have good qualifications and transportation. Go elsewhere. You will easily find better pay."
good,"The goal of a job should be to do your best and earn an living.  There are many issues at ADT with only a few managers who display a passive -aggressive mentality.  There are however, others that are great and will lead you towards success.  This lower management style has lead many highly successful and tenured (16 years+)representatives to walk out"
good,"We would a meeting every day before we go out to sell."
good,If single great job.  Do not care about employee well being or health.  Would rather have you work than take care of yourself.  Local management only cares about numbers.
good,If you have PTO time that was already scheduled and yet have an emergency they take ur PTO automatically and still write you up. They could care less if your a single parent all they care about is whether you came to work and signed up for over time while the managers play on their phones make personal phones calls and leave early while they mandate everyone else to OT
good,"Its an ok job to start off with. You are definitely not paid for the amount/type of work you are trained for. Like any other job, it has its UPS & DOWNS & DRAMA. Micromanaging managers. You have to work every Saturday.  Be prepared to hear NO for pretty much anything you ask for."
good,I really did not enjoy working there. I stayed as long as I did because I needed a job. But there is no room for advancement in the call center. You could barely take a breather between calls. Too stressful for me.
good,I feel this job was a hit and miss. Some customers were unhappy with us  cold calling people at 8 in the evening and depending on time zone it could be after 9pm at times.
good,Whatever the position is at ADT they're very strict with their policies and their quota's which they care more about than the well-being of their employee's.
good,competitive work environment.  pay doesn't reflect the hours you put in.  I hit quota for the year and didn't make what I thought I would make.  Be accountable and think outside the box.
good,ADT's call center is a great job for young college student looking to make good money for a short time. Outside of that I can't really recommend them.
good,"2 IPOs, 3 CFO's.  A VP who never visited once in my employment.  No room for advancement.  They have just replaced him with a new VP who will draw a finer line. Current Director cannot handle anyone who knows what they are doing and sees it as a threat.  "
good,"There is no room for advancement, only way to get promoted is by reorganization or people leaving the company. Very high turnover, specially in the finance area."
good,"programas excesivamente complicados"
good,it was ok while it lasted also management needs help co-workers are great System needs to change No for body in Management takes responsibility for problems everything fell on techs shoulders Major inventory issues
good,"There are a lot of great individuals that make the workplace here.  A lot of them do not get the recognition they deserve.  It is a pretty easy job, however, depending on the department."
good,"Nice perks if you work at HQ office with onsite cafeteria, gym, salon, starbucks. This company very rarely promotes from within so don't assume a fast-track career path from a HQ perspective (field is different)."
good,"I really don't want to give a summary. "
good,"The company has a  high management turn over, thus creates instability in the workflow and  inability of commission employees to make a consistent wage."
good,"steady paycheck, little room for advancement unless your willing to relocate or completely change jobs.  Terrible raises"
good,Great opportunity if corporate and management would give support and more training. Possibility of making a lot of money if you work in the right demographic under good management.
good,I really had a problem with that the job description I applied for was clerical secretary and I ended up with outside sales plus part of the clerical duties.
good,"ADT has great products and associates and is number one for Security and Fire Safety, however, the company is experiencing growing pains after its split from Tyco and struggles and competes against itself."
good,Job security and customer service was not their main priority. Filling seats was. You never knew what was changing in advance and where expected to invoke changes at a moments notice. Upper management was more involved in favoring certain people instead of managing. Thankfully the department that I worked in had great co-workers and they are the reason that I stayed so long and loved coming to work. The outside work force was the same.
good,"The work load is ridiculous, the pay is below average and the stress level doesn't match the pay. The management is great and the training provided is adequate"
good,Managers were hired off the customer service floor and not qualified to be a manager.
good,"i been there almost a year and i been through 5 managers, crazy right no job security , job culture is no real when you go to Ind they blow it up then you come back down to earth after a few weeks lol"
good,"Start at 2pm going door to door trying to sell home security systems and end at around 7-8pm which made it uncomfortable for me cause that's dinner time and many people didn't like that we were trying to sell them things that late. I learned how to do door to door sales in a totally different way which helped me be able to do sales later on with Venturi Technologies my job after ADT. No management opportunities. Co-workers were very supportive and helpful, built great friendships. Hardest part of the job was going door to door late at night in really bad neighborhoods and just not knowing what might happen. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know new people and contacts"
good,"Arrive to destination, greet customer, verify job to be completed, installed security system, and confirmed job completion. Learned to install home and small business security alarm system. Traveled orange county and L.A. county areas to job sites in personal vehicle. Most difficult part of job is to know if assignment was going to go through with customer."
good,"A typical work day started at 8am with a conference call that included the manager and teammates.  We would discuss yesterdays sales results, how far away from the monthly and weekly goals we were individually.  Lastly, what is on the schedule for sales appointments for the day, if you do not have any sales appointments or install appointments, then what will you do to generate business before the day closes at 8pm.  I learned a lot in a straight commission sales environment.  Organization and commitment to the process of generating business can't stop, you have to keep your pipeline full because customers will change their minds for any reason, but the sales goals must be met.  Therefore, a daily plan must be executed no matter what happens, this way you have a platform to develop tweaks if necessary.  In other words you cannot fly by the seat of your pants and expect to achieve the results you and your manager are working towards."
good,"Excelente inicio profesional, emprendi grandes desafios"
good,"This job is all peice work, so usually the good jobs are given to the employees who have been there a while and are in good with the dispatchers."
good,"managers babysit you all day, pay is terrible, car allowance is way less than you spend."
good,Main product focus is home integration rather than security.
good,"ADT is not a bad company to work for. My primary complaint with ADT is that there is no room for growth. If I would have stayed I would have worked in the same department doing the same thing for the rest of my life. It is incredibly repetitive which got old. Other than that, it is not a bad company to work for."
good,Nothing really exciting. I have learned a lot however there is no advancement opportunities.
good,"typcial day at work 12 hour day "
good,The people I meet here were great but having to walk all day was a different story . We worked the same areas over and over and worked until 9pm out door knocking in very dangerous areas. Due to health issues I could not keep up with being constantly on my feet and walking
good,1) Typical day at work:
good,Lots of walking good training from management. dealing with disorderly students can happen.
good,Make phone calls until you set at least one appointment. Not something that happened everyday. The importance of life safety. I have a good manager that is dedicated to his work. My coworkers are always willing to help. Making enough money to get by can be difficult at times. Protecting peoples homes and families can be quite rewarding.
good,"This job really is not all that it is cracked up to be. It is only commission paid but it is so hard to make any money there so you basically are working there for free. Even though I gained a lot of experience, experience does not pay bills or keep food on the table."
good,Make sure you clock in on time for shift and any breaks. Late by 1 minute you get dinged. Don't even try to take a day before or after a holiday off.
good,a typical day at work
good,"Very long hours and a lot of work to do. We did get paid decent compensation. Good job, no benefits. Owner expected too much from just one person, myself. I did a lot of work in all departments. I would work 70 hours a week and after leaving the office. I would take care of her child, Run errands, then go to her house cook dinner, laundry, & chores for the week. After awhile it was just too much because I was left with little or none family/personal time."
good,Great Place ive been there for 6 years almost and its a WOnderful place
good,your job was collection of unpaid collection accounts with also customer service expectations and which you were given strikes sometime for providing excellent customer service by spending to much time trying to help certain customers issues that this certain customer has had for sometime
good,"Fast-paced work environment"
good,The services provided by ADT are exceptional.  Lot of do's and don'ts.  Management could do a better job of providing more individual support.  Average sales cycle 45-120 days.
good,"Office work dealing around alarm."
good,Fast paced. Day goes by quickly. Pay doesn't align to job. Management is gossip. They try to get rid of long term employees. Most coworkers are awesome.
good,Working for the company was very nice until we found out that we were going to be let go. It became very depressing to work there after that. My supervisor did try her best to down play it.
good,expected to work 6 days a week. appointments can be as early as 8 am to 8pm. You make your own schedule but if you want more appointments it makes for a long work day
good,Very low strategic orientation.  Seemed like a pretty reactive environment. Lots of use of contractors with high turnover.  Little effort toward retaining good employees.
good,"A typical day with ADT started with rushing out the door while checking your job itinerary for the day mapping your location to arrive at your first install job, while reviewing your on hand inventory sheets to have proper items on hand to complete work orders. then continuing thru the day picking up missing items at distributers for jobs installs thru out the day as needed. regulating install times with commutes between job sites logging in spread sheets, equipment replacement orders and keeping up vehicle maintenance. I learned a huge amount on time management and security protocols from this skilled industry. This work places culture will need to evolve to keep any quality team members. I think the hardest part of this carrier was the lack of support from management. the most enjoyable part of the job was a happy and excited customer thanking you for protecting there family."
good,"typical day, take inbound and make outbound calls for alarm dispatching and help troubleshoot false alarms for customers, also collections for billing department is more customer service than collections, they ask do you want to pay, if customers says no then thank you and on to next call"
good,"The atmosphere was relaxed at ADT.  However, the culture was not professional and I did not feel motivated with the type of environment there.  The hardest part of the job was being on the phone.  The most enjoyable part were my coworkers."
good,Me permitió ganar experiencia laboral y asi poder conseguir mejores propuestas.
good,Good Company call volume is extremely high. Sr Management would rather higher externally instead of develop/hire from within. Raises are very small 1-3% and they will pay new hires more than the employees with tenure
good,"Working in the call center for 10+ years.  Terrible pay for those with tenure.  Most coming in off of the street make more than those who have stayed strong and remained as an employee for many years, providing fantastic customer service.   Much nepotism, narcissism, and favoritism."
good,"Monitor incoming alarms, contact the necessary clients to verify alarm status.  Contacted necessary authorities if needed and on certain alarms direct police contact was needed."
good,under paid and over worked. for the experience I have the pay could have been  better and they need to be more aware of the verbal abuse from customer
good,"For the overall job its a great environment to work at, the pay is horrible."
good,They do offered pay training but after that it is strictly just commission or bonus only. The training is very intense and you have to pick up the pace quickly and very details.
good,entreprise grande et très motivante pour se surpasser
good,"After the merger it became an ADT show, all of the good P1 stuf was slowly wiped away and the ADT culture came in, bad customer service, P1 employees get the shaft."
good,"Upper management had unrealistic expectations regarding department requirements. Middle management was constantly conflicted between providing assistance to workers, while appeasing to the politics of the executives."
good,"Management is unorganized, training does not teach you what you need to know. You learn everything and how it works when you hit the sales floor. Pay is good but the hoops you need to jump through to get there is difficult. If you want to settle and be nothing more than a call center agent with decent pay and want to work in a cut throat environment this is the place for you"
good,"A typical day at ADt Kusela start by doing handover .6h00 open the gates greeting stuff, directing customers and visitors.searching those who exit the premise. Hardest part is that you r always on your feet no time to sit down"
good,"they started out great but with cut backs and people abusing the system they had to tighten up, coming up with new ways to let people go that don't hold up to a standard i have seen, friends leave do to the tactics."
good,"A few thoughts,"
good,"Answer calls from inbound members regarding their alarm history "
good,the staff there where nice and we got to get out a lot and try to sell and see new places of course the hardest part about the job is trying to sell your products.
good,"large corporate company with top heavy control from the US .."
good,"Vendas (bruta)"
good,I worked in the myrtle beach office for a short time frame and everyone seemed miserable.  I wasn't there for very long so i can't really give a good or bad review one way or another. This was also 5 years ago so I am sure a ton has changed.
good,It is good depending on which franchise owner you work under. If you are able to recieve benefits and base pay then I would recommend it as it can be highly rewarding.
good,"Really not a bad place to work, at the same time not a great place to work. The pay scale was a little bit on the lite side, that is the reason I left the company."
good,"As long as you are okay being in the same position for years this will be a great stable job for you. It is hard to get fired as long as you do the minimum requirements. I tried constantly to get into other positions and was not able to because of one reason or another. If you just want a paycheck and want to do something easy, this is the perfect job. with no opportunities for incentives and little opportunities for advancement left me feeling bored and unappreciated."
good,"Very negative environment, never enough to meet and exceed goals, mostly a popularity contest, lacking benefits and none for management if you are not winning the popularity"
good,People are friendly and nice to work with. You have to able to multitask and pay attention to detail. Also you need to work at a fast pace. Very important!
good,A typical day of work consist of ways to attract more customer using the marketing promotion and setting up solid appointments. I have learned to engage more on a highest customer level and accommodate them on their every security system needs. The management gives high importance to the best sales rep by giving them good employees perks. Great co worker environment. The hardestpart of the job was to make new customers and allocate where they can be found. The freedom of work hours are the best part of this job.
good,"Very busy environment, call volume can get busy depending on any issues with online electronic contract website. Reps will call in to find solutions to issues"
good,"Co-workers are great, but the hours can be long.  Senior management doesn't seem to have a clue what they are doing but ""front line"" management work tirelessly to try and make the place better."
good,"Es la empresa donde me desarrollé profesionalmente, es muy buena pero no valoraban el bienestar de los empleados."
good,You will work 70/hrs a week and if you dont produce you will be cut off. Its commission based and they know if they want you to quit all they have to do is cut your leads off and you will have no money coming in. I went through 3 managers in 1 year.
good,"I installed security and camera systems in residential homes and small businesses, I learned a lot about the technical along with the labor part of this business."
good,"It is a very difficult place to get accustomed to. While lower management does there best, upper management has no clue whats going on."
good,"Its a busy work environment, vibrant, motivated, energetic, and active workplace. It is a ""extensive,"" ""cost effective,"" ""innovative,"" ""versatile"" and ""customer-focused environment"
good,"Very challenging place to work just like any other working at 100% commission."
good,"Promouvoir et vendre les produits de sécurité dans un territoire assigné"
good,"A typical day at work is waking up in then morning gong door do door and trying to sell ADT alarm system and sometimes iI would have  a good week selling a few and sometimes none at all. I have learn to close deals much better. The hardest part of the job is still getting up when it's cold, raining or both and still going out to make a sale. The enjoyable part is seeing my customers happy with there system"
good,"Poor mana•a typical day at work"
good,"vendiamos alarmas a buenos aires y a san juan 5 horas y teniamos "
good,The hardest part was dealing with the disorganization and constant discrepancies in timesheets
good,A descent company to work for if they could keep installers. Being that my salary was based on commission and could not get paid until the system was installed it led me to leave the company since my check was never stable.
good,ADT was great at first but alot of things happen under the table and they act like the employees dont see it
good,Typical day would start with a sales management call that took 30 minutes daily. We then would go to our first appointment or if there was non we would have the choice to go door knocking and hanging flyers or make cold calls from leads that were not qualified.
good,"Help technicians install alarm systems,verify all work is complete and accurate. Management is kind of hands off. The hardest part of my job is working with people with a language barrier. My co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Enjoyed learning security biz, and most co-workers were kind and helpful overall.  Not a team environment; open conflicts between department managers was an ongoing hindrance, but I know not all branches have that problem.  Good corporate and ongoing training offerings, and good information resources on internal website.  Turnover is 80%+ and didn't learn that nasty fact until a few months in.  In spite of screening applicants to the extreme, I never felt valued or appreciated as an employee.  Sadly, the hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager, who unfortunately is the most difficult person I've ever met.  I enjoyed getting paid weekly and the commission is quite good when you make enough sales."
good,"Calls, meetings tie up in the mornings, visits to appts and troubleshooting issues in the pm"
good,ADT has great benefits and 401k. It was a close commute from my home.
good,The good part about the job is it is all incoming calls. No outbound calling at all. The bad part is you are expected to close 50% of the leads that come in and there are a good amount of leads that are not able to be closed. They still count against you. You also get penalized if an order you set up cancels which is out of your control. Everything is done by skill based routing so if you don't do well one week you might not get the same amount of calls the next week. The people that work there are great and that's why I have been there as long as I have.
good,ADT was a good an bad place to me. one because you can go travel city to city an meet new people but its a waste of time an money in ways. you have to fight for your money in the field and place no one likes sales people (door to door sales)
good,Long hours little pay lack of proper management. No proper supervision or management in field or office. Great job for those who need little to no supervision.
good,It was okay. A lot going good for the company but a lot of negatives. I overall enjoyed my time at ADT. Kind of a lousy company.
good,"a typical day would be repeating same things everyday,what i have learned is to have patience when working with people,management has its days some are good and some are not managers are humans after all,most co-workers are fun to work with,the hardest thing would be to do something ive never done to impress management,the most enjoyable thing for me is being on the road"
good,A typical day at work involves motivating the staff and assisting where necessary. Allocating daily task and ensuring that all these tasks are completed and feedback received. Lists of problem accounts are compiled for daily meetings with MDs.
good,"my day is long and very busy especial because I have to walk almost 7 hours before i arrived at work,I learned to work with different kind of people and how to handle pressure when they arise thats one of the things which motivate me to take care in the industry of psychology,the management is poor from what i have learn t they are too ignorance and care for their own benefit,the hardest part in my job is walking long distance waking too early and arrived home very late,I enjoy my job because i can be able to study when I'm not that busy,"
good,"I learned that although we could eliminate frustrated customers calling in that they had cancelled several months ago but we are still auto debiting their account although this could be an easy solution to eliminate this problem but management wasn't willing to take those steps to provide appropriate customer service, there were many other issues that I saw that the company could have avoided but decided instead yo pass the buck so that no one took ownership of the situation and provided a solution for it."
good,This is the perfect job for a single person that is a workaholic. If you can hustle and your a fast learner and you dont mind putting in 60 hours a week then you can make some big money. If you only want to work a 40 hours a week then you wont do well at this job.
good,"co workers are great, however the management has not been there to help out. The lack of training has taken its toll."
good,"very frustrating not being trained on the product line as a sales rep.. too many factors can go wrong concerning customer cancellations and then you're charged back, due to no fault of your own!! the manager can cancel the job.. the tech can mess up the job, which means it won't go in and therefore not get the rest of your money. the system can automatically cancel your jobs after 15 days or whenever they feel like it. you can get low balled by an authorized dealer and your deal can be cancelled. the ""arrogant"" call center (order line) ppl can disposition your order incorectly and that can mess you up. and of course the customer can cancel, two minutes after you leave, and no one cares enough to contact you or to try and retain said customer. not enough sales rep support. policy changes mid month.. a price can be reduced june 13, and now you have to scramble to talk to custmers you lost and try to get them back.. if they answer the phone. too many unethical reps."
good,"After the first 90 days of probationary period i was supposed to get a .75 cent raise, that did happen. It wasn't until almost a year later until I got that raise, and they told me that i would get retro pay from the 90 day period to the current date and that never happened."
good,Needs to be more customer focused and needs to hire more professional individuals. Upper management very poor.
good,the people who work there that say they are making money are having other streams of income from the company through management/recruitment/etc it is a good job for a person who doesn't have anything to lose
good,"When you first start they give the whole speech about ""focus on the customer, don't worry about your stats,"" but they eventually flip to ""improve your stats, the customer will call back."" They will also promise anything to get you hired, and then turn around and say they never heard of any of it."
good,ADT is a diverse workplace. You can meet people from all walks of life. Flexible hours as well as multiple locations depending on the department that best suits your experience.
good,"ADT has a pretty casual and laxed dress code. However, considering a variety of factors such as management, call volume, salary, and potential career growth; I would not consider ADT a longevity place of employment"
good,"It is fast paced which is a reality with all security companies. They gave us an education NQF 4 before employing us, so I would say their HR department is the best but the work environment is not. You seldom get lunch, all you do is work the whole 12 hours and there are favourites"
good,"The salary wasn't as assured and I am now struggling financially each month which makes the job harder"
good,"I choose not to elaborate however in my opinion the company made drastic changes more bad than good over the past few years. Although a lot of decisions made we in good faith, they completely lacked courtesy and consideration of employees’ life outside of work/personal issues. I can also not stress enough how much favoritism is a big issue within the company. Turnover rate is as high as the stress level of the job."
good,"The industry is dying because of DIY and they are slashing compensation and churning employees like crazy. There are some great people, but overall, its just poor"
good,Left because of poor management. Otherwise I would have stayed. Compensation is ok but could be better. Good training but should have continuing training to learn more
good,"ADT has been around for years, and is the top security company  in North America.  However, in recent years, it has become increasingly more about the numbers and less about the customers(actual and employees.  We were told at one time we were internal customers).  Management spends most of their time on conference calls and crunching numbers to make everything look good.  Technicians are increasingly being pushed to sell and go faster.  We're working on average 50+ hours a week, and were just recently placed on mandatory 6 days, so now 60+ hours.  Pay is good as you get overtime after 40 hours. You have the potential to make good money, but all the hoops and hurdles make it extremely stressful, and it changes constantly."
good,"I’ve Been working at ADT for 2 years. Working there I have given my all when I’m at work taken back to back calls and not being notice as what you do there. Status, status, is all they say some watching you transfer time talk time."
good,"Attend weekly morning meetings and may need to "
good,Make sure techs are at there 1st calls by 800am. Checking emails and queues for and emergencies. Answering phones ordering parts and dropping them off if needed.I was in a room by myself so I could concentrate. I don't think any part of my job was hard  that I couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part was going ro work t face the new challenges.
good,The work is very hard and challenging. The team lead managers are great at helping you out. The overtime is compensated as well. They do no like for you to miss any work or take time off when you are sick. People have to come to work sick and spread it around.
good,Clerical work and sales assistance. Limited resources and high opportunity for creative thinking. Logistics-minded people will thrive in this company.
good,"I have been employed at ADT for 15 years and have seen a lot of changes. I have worked my way up to management and have provided well for my family.  The disconnect that I see is that the departments within ADT do not have synergy with one another.  The National Marketing Center does not communicate well with the Sales and Service office(SSO). The Operations Support Center does not work well with the SSO and there seems to be a disconnect between all the branches that make ADT work. A lot of the disconnect is from scorecards and matrix that track the wrong numbers and change continually. I lay a lot at the feet of middle-level management in ADT that does not have the courage to speak freely with the VPs and the Executive Leadership Team(ELT). This causes people on the local level to feel like their managers are not fighting for them and it causes low morale.  In the most recent grassroots survey, front line managers received a high grade but middle management and the ELT received low marks.  The people that suffer from poor leadership is the local folks in the offices that have to feel the wrath of the customer on a daily basis. There are many headwinds within the security industry and ADT seems to be double-minded and can't make a decision on which way it wants to go."
good,"confidentiel, ne vaut pas la peine d'en discuter, merci"
good,"There is not much room to advance, if the present management likes you and you play their politics you might advance with the company  They try very hard to show how much they appreciate the employees but not very good pay raises."
good,"The company drives sales in every aspect of the business, down to the technician level, in many cases offering products and service to elderly customers without the means or desire to use the services, i.e. Home automation, live video services, etc."
good,In my opinion there was a lot of structure on the management side that was missing. Part of that could be due to new services and options that were being rolled out. Not a lot of teaching workshops or allotted time for sales agents to learn how to improve.
good,Just a typical Sales job.  Nothing special with this ADT position.  The local leadership was not good.  There was no unity within the local sales office between departments or employees.
good,"Management does not care about technicians."
good,"Flexable Shifts, long hours as well as 7/7 or 5/2 days. Can shift trade with other coworkers if needed."
good,"Overall, I do enjoy my job. The culture is one of coaching and development. Management is heavily inconsistently and there are few opportunities to advance."
good,Until the Pro1 merge and then it became mandatory to work overtime without overtime pay. So the work family life balance got out of control. I loved working for ADT and enjoyed the install team and install managers that worked alongside me to help every customer we came across. But had to balance my life and sales Management didn't care if your producing and only card about the hours you were putting in.
good,"A call center setting that is fast paced, answering calls as they come in in a very timely manner which teaches most how to improve and handle stressful busy times throughout the day. ADT Security was bought out within the last 2 years and is very inconsistent with corporate policies."
good,"Not the best place to work, first line managers try but the rules make it hard. Customers look down on on everyone and most other workers don't want to do what they are supposed to."
good,"Buenas relaciones con los colegas de trabajo."
good,"allowing vehicles and visitors in and out of the complex"
good,"This is a good company with poor local management. But is trying to get better. The techs have all the overtime they want, but the company provides for a poor to fair work/life balance. Pay is average for the market. benefits are pretty good."
good,"Working in sales in a tough business. ADT is no exception. This is a fast paced, competitive opportunity that only the strong survive. This job was one of the most exciting but difficult jobs I've ever done."
good,"Enjoyed meeting new people all the time. Never a moment with nothing to do.  Paid well for sales, but increasingly involved more & more $0 time spent to get to the point of sale. Company seemed to be phasing out the Field Sales Rep customer experience, with regards to incoming call inquiries, in favor of the bottom line Phone Sale Rep.  Unfortunate, sales appointments for the field position shifted more & more to rely on cold calling telemarketing skills and door to door sales tactics."
good,Due to new managers and us merging with ADT my recommendation & review is very low. We cannot seem to all get on the same page. We have lost so many employees over time and we can't seem to keep anyone for long. Growth comes with time but they have been making it very difficult with the way everything operates.
good,Sales is fast pace.  It is easy to achieve work life balance.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  They have a good safe security product.  Hard work is rewarded.
good,"Technical Installation all over"
good,Sales - This would be a great job if the initial training was improved upon and quotas were more lenient while new employees gain ground. The management was decent but workplace relationships were not as most of the new sales staff never stick around.  It's great for the employees who have been there for more than five years but there aren't many that last more than six months.
good,"My industry experience 15 years"
good,"You must be self driven"
good,"Very stressful environment, not much room for advancement. Not much follow up training. Low pay with not a lot of flexibility with schedules. Management team not always approachable."
good,"Managers are very lazy, If they do not want to complete the project they will place it on you, regardless of work load.  Also there are entirely to many chiefs and not enough Indians.  They do not acknowledge you and you will never hear good job only what you did not do correctly.  Work is very simple just a lot without help if you become overwhelmed."
good,The rate of pay is very low but is comparable for the industry. The many fringe benefits make up for the low pay however there is little opportunity for advancement.
good,"Good people but not the best management in the world. ADT used to generate a lot of leads but after the spinoff from TYCO they have dropped the commercial lead program and concentrated on residential leads which is 85% of their business. On the plus side, to make quota one had to develop one's own lead development program, which over time turned out to be one of the best things that happened."
good,They tend to treat people very well on the front end but it doesn't last long. Has potential for a strong B2B  rep. One of their biggest issues is their products are over priced so its hard for reps to  compete in the market.
good,OK place to work. Not much room for advancement. Have been hiring from outside a lot. I work with team members and talk to customers. The culture is fast paced.
good,"This company have very tough requirements as far as talk time which pushes you to rush the customer off the phone to meet talk time requirements, in turn creates a bad customer experience. This company has a vase revolving door."
good,"Hard work , long hours and no room for errors as you work with people live and property. The job needs young single and as you spend 12 hours at work leaving you with less time with family."
good,"It's a good, diverse place to work. I've learned how to interact with different people and their personalities. "
good,Management style is micromanging.  Managers try to engage with employees but some employees been there for years and expect what they had previously.  The best part is helping internal customers
good,"Call Center atmosphere, moderate to high stress, moderate training. Need to be self motivated. Coworkers were great. Hardest part of the job is stability but thats with any commission based job. Most enjoyable is unlimited OT."
good,"Run to warehouse, grab parts.  run from job to job.  sometimes as a tech you repair a standard system that was installed way too fast.  other times you repair some junk that is out of date, and you have no manuals or any idea of how to fix it.  for the latter, it is a crapshoot.  you have to make like you know exactly why the heck anyone would buy some tabletop answering machine alarm with 20 wireless points with oddball batteries that you don't even stock at the warehouse.  when in training was told that when you go on a job always pick a different ""analysis"" code to fool the computer so that it won't show you on a job for a repeat action.  this will flag you and get you shot down quick.  so if you go on a wireless sensor, and they call back a week later, make sure you put battery on one ticket, and equipment failure on another.  service and installation manager do just that.  they manage, but don't have any empathy for anything else."
good,"My time at Marks and Spencer started off well,  however it just got worse and worse.."
good,Learned about the ADT alarm systems. experienced about personal alarm installations .Home  installations proved more difficult than business.
good,its very boring here nothing exciting the pay is decent. You can advance here quickly I believe there is favoritism. This was my first call center job and for me to be entry level it really helped me outbeing edo because it gave me time to learn to work a computer. I had excellent training.
good,It has been a good stint with ADT so far which has enabled me in honing my sales skills and also polish my leadership skills. A very friendly working environment offering a good job work life balance.
good,if they put as much effort in keeping employees happy as they do pretending to keep the customers happy. it would be a whole different experience. as they might actually provide better customer service in the long run.
good,"What I learned with this company is there is no job security. Management was very helpful and co-workers were taught to cross-train.Had to bend over backwards sometimes to please customers, but security service is a people business."
good,"Employés compétents, peu de culture d'entreprise, situation de changement perpetuelle"
good,I Love this job but I feel that I am very under paid for the amount of work I do. I also dont feel there is much room to grow in this company.
good,The company overall is nice. I didnt like the pay rate and not being able to have the flexibilty desired. Management was great making sure you have all the tools and resources needed to complete your job daily.
good,"I love ADT however, working for ADT just is not for me.  With ought going in to great detail it can use a lot of work within the work environment.  Looking for something less stressful and more stable financially.  I have learned a great deal about technology and will take that forward into my next career.  Hoping to find something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life."
good,Communication between different departments are not relayed correctly. Policies and procedures conflict with attempts to have great customer service
good,"Identify prospects utilizing creative lead generating techniques "
good,Would be a good job if you didn't spend most of the time cold calling and door knocking. Was rewarding when you were able to help some one. Company leads were very slim due to they could sell it over the phone
good,Was a good Experience and i learned alot. Each day had its own chalenges but it was a good feeling accomplishing the goals set in  place.
good,"Make a great deal of cold calls to leads provided by ADT, which are clients who have purchase ADT already, which we are supposed to resell the product to. These targets do not want to hear from us because they have been hammered repeatedly by a multitude of agents attempting to sign them up. "
good,"Typical day started 7 am. Received jobs on hand held device."
good,"ADT is good for a entry level position. the mangers are the worst, they don't want to help you. now that I have my customer service experience I am leaving."
good,"ADT is going through constant change as they complete their no compete clause with TYCO Security who previously owned and operated ADT Security Inc. Management is turning over quickly as levels are being eliminated.and streamlined in cost cutting efforts."
good,Many problems for the future of this company.No room to move. Management is rough around the edges.
good,"Made out going calls for alarm for residental customers, Learned about rules and regulations for emergency services . Management was  helpful and supportive and was lots of commodore between co workers. The hardest  was when customers had there homes broken. Most enjoyable was the co workers"
good,"The products & services/technology is interesting and fun to sell. It was/is a great product line that has a promising future market value."
good,The job pays good but sometimes you have to woek late.  The coordinator in fayetteville didnt know how to do her job and thought she was in charge.   The new manager was a puppet and wasnt very friendly. They tell you at the start that tou can make your own hours but if you got done before 5 then they woukd give you another job that last three hours making you get home after 9. The only thing that made the job was the money when it is there.
good,End Users were a complete success with the implementation of the 2012 Epic software
good,"This was a good job, but it was difficult due to the hours for someone of my age. I often felt like I was going to fall asleep at the wheel driving home. The work conditions were adequate but needed some updating."
good,"Muy bajo sueldo, no era un trabajo estable."
good,"Making cold call, going door to door. making sure that after an install that the customer is satisfied with their purchase."
good,"You will drive your car into the ground, on a lot of appointments that are cancelled with Corp. before you arrive, so you have driven 45 min out, to have the appointment cancelled. Your competition is the ADT Dealers, which is very confusing to explain the difference to the customer. The dealer offer all the GREAT deals whereas ADT Corp work on more ethics. You are also protecting your sales from the actual Installer, who will use technical upselling on all your customers. You are micro managed with everyday monitoring checking your stats and daily schedule."
good,"ADT Boca Raton. Lovely office building. Nose to the grindstone. Upper Management is terrible. Don't expect a 'thank you' for any work performed. It's expected. All depends who you report to. You're pretty much on your own with little direction, if any. The people are very nice and hard working. You'll spend most of your day looking for who is who in the food chain."
good,"Chei ótimo o contato com os clientes, fornecedores e com as pessoas que trabalharam comigo!"
good,I learned how to sale while working here. On a typical day I went door to door soliciting a product and built my sales skills. I had extensive product knowledge and learned the fundamentals of sales.
good,"Since the merger with Broadview and ADT, procedures gradually changed as expected. I was trained under the former Brinks, Broadview accounts. Recently, ADT provided training classes to Broadview Customer Care Reps about the new ADT Mastermind database and procedures. The issue was the new database didn't launch until a month after training. In my opinion, ADT should have handled the new updates differently. At least, For the Reps, who've completed the training course; start immediately with a test pilot group. My Co-workers were great. I never meet a single person I didn't like there. The hardest part of working for ADT was listening to upset customers talking about everything from billing,alarm events, sooner service dates and blind transfers from different departments with very little pay increase to show at the end of the year."
good,Go in and get work order and do the installs. I've learn all the aspect of the job then became the asst. ops manager. The management were great people to work with along with my coworker I don't have one thing to complain about we all worked will together. The hardest part about the job was keeping work all the time and I enjoyed the team I've worked with
good,"From my experience, this company does not care about its employees. There is constant change regarding pay, incentives, benefits and sales process. Management can hardly keep up and has a difficult time relaying to the employees. There is little advancement opportunities and employees are just looked at as numbers which is why turnover is so high. I have been with the company about three years and would not reccomend it to anyone."
good,"Very stressful job. I worked at the account service center on Kernan blvd. Management barely does their job, if anything at all. Wouldnt recommend anyone working for the ASC."
good,"Great place to work because of the potential growth. If you are successful then you will get promoted. If you are a sales person, you will need to be a hunter and ready to work 60 hours a week. The management never knows what is going on until the change occurs. If you are able to become a manager then you have a place in the company until you decide to leave or the company removes your department."
good,A typical day of work is pretty much extremely fast paced and non-stop all day long. Most of my co-workers are fun to be around all day. Unfortunately we are understaffed and not allowed overtime so it also adds high stress to the fast pace...for those of us who want to get the job done!
good,I take approximately 100 calls per day. The things I have learned about working here is how important you treat people. And to have good management that know what they are doing and not just here because they have a degree. The hardest part of my job is not being able to make all my customers happy. Getting up coming to work and seeing my co-workers.
good,Individuals have the ability to work independently and interact with customer's or potential customer's face to face. One must be willing to travel most of the time and be organized well enough to complete all paperworks accurately and on timely basis. There is some cold calling although you may generate potential business through your own networking and with the assistance of ADT 800 customer service line.
good,Place is alright. No loyalty to long time employees though. Worked hard for them for 3 and a half years just for them to terminate me for having one bad call.
good,"Buena empresa con cosas a mejorar, como la parte humana. Pero buen salario. Y buenos premios."
good,"Cultura organizacional debe mejorar hay poca organización, no se le da importancia a la capacitación y no se respeta tus tiempos de comida y descanso. Aprendes mucho sobre la marcha, puedes ganar buenas comisiones y el trabajo se ve facilitando ligeramente cuando vaz creando tu cartera de clientes"
good,"ADT is a very solid company to work for, but due to staff turnovers there is always a shortage of people to do the hands on work on the ground. The processes and policies are excellent, but staff are mostly overlooked in the process. Suggestions are encouraged."
good,I liked helping the people with my education I was better than most of the agents and make the customer feel that they mattered. In the last two years they were more concerned with high calls per hour than customer service
good,ADT is a nice place to work at and offers a lot to their FTE employees. They have Main Street which offers a gym that you could join.  They have a hair and nail salon that has accommodating hours along with a shop to purchase ADT logo items along with a Starbucks for your coffee/sweet cravings.
good,"When I first started working at ADT, I loved it.  Loved my manager, my team, my work environment.  After 2 years policy changes were made and most not for the better.  They gave us all a pay raise, which was great, until they said it was something that they had to do in order to keep up with new hire rates. I honestly can say though that the managers I had were some of the most AMAZING managers I've ever had. However, over time I started going from loving my job to only going because I needed to keep a roof over my head. The policy changes which I can accept that happens, started to become overbearing and detrimental to a good work environment.  You went from caring for your customers, to taking as many calls as humanly possible and trying to meet stats that were increasing each month.  I did love the people I work with, but the environment has started to become increasingly stressful.  I wish ADT would go back to the way they were, and were caring to their employees. There are no sick time so if you called out due to being sick, or had a family emergency, they took it out of your PTO and what they call ""unscheduled"" time, so you were hit twice.  If you were too sick to come in a Dr's note would only cover up to 3 days and you only got that once a year.  Anyone who's worked in a call center knows that you can get sick frequently, so you have to come in even when your feeling like your about to die in order not to get written up.  One of the biggest issues is that when your on a phone call it can go anywhere from 5-35 minutes depending on what all you have to address or help"
good,I enjoy talking to the Technicians out in the field and helping them get the job done. I would love to advance in the company but there is really no where in the company I would like to advance to.
good,"I was let go by ADT after my father suffered a stroke and told they would rehire me after everything was settled. When I reapplied, as I was told to do, the HR Manager critiqued my resume & advised me to change my end date for ADT. Never heard from them again. Pretty unprofessional and tactless."
good,been with adt a long time things change all the time and not always for the better. The shifts are long and can be very tiring  ………………………………………………………………..
good,"Schedule is constantly overbooked, sales reps don't sale jobs correctly, technician gets blamed for everything and there is to much pressure put on the technician ."
good,"Mejorar el clima laboral e instalaciones, deben cuidar a los buenos empleados y cumplir con los compromisos que se ofrecen."
good,A normal day at work includes being drowned with calls coming in and getting yelled at by customers. Upper Management seems to be completely out of touch with what the reps deal with on a daily basis and tend to make changes to our access/processes that adversely affect our ability to do our job to the fullest. The pay is decent and honestly the only reason I've stayed as long as I have.
good,"rude people. escalated calls. Doing multi jobs for lowest pay in company. Good thing about job is the Co-workers.   Typical call center. Quality on telephone reports can be used against your over all.  don't miss more than 80 hours per year, keep reliability rate above 96 you should be fine. anything lower they will write you up. hard to do with all the transfers from other departments, calls being cold transferred  or people calling wrong department."
good,over the years the company has had numerous upper management changes from outside of the industry; employees became dollar signs instead of assets which has negatively impacted morale.
good,"Badly managed company since ADT took over Protectron. Executives have no incentive to sell new customers, focus is on a niche market of rich clients. As a commissioned salesperson you have way less opportunities to sell"
good,Definite need to put in the activity to build a pipe line to maximize sales. Set your own schedule for the most part.  Installation crew would work with sales team to get jobs installed
good,"Cuando forme grupo de la empresa, la dirección era incierta, con metas no bien definidas y con obejtivos muy dificiles de alcanzar."
good,fast paced busy take a variety of calls from billing to tech support and providing workorders for techs to come to homes and businesses when needed . a lot of loyalty and relocation calls too
good,"Great Place if you are a Go Getter and know how to prospect and get sales on your own, Company Leads don't pay as much But are like icing on the Cake."
good,"This was over 15 years ago unfair to give it a review as it might be considered current.  At the time the management was good, rather forgiving and non-policy enforcement."
good,"nothing different a lot of other companies' employees have gone through"
good,"Great benefits including medical, dental, 401K, vision and tuition reimbursement. However you never get quite enough training, you are expected to pickup more than you should have to on the job. Also I worked in the call center, unfortunately it was run like it was in the 70s. It was all stat driven with with no connection between stats and desired outcomes."
good,Its a very fast paced work enviroment.  Have to keep up with demands of the heavy work schedule.  You are scored on your work performance every day. Use to be a fun place to work but management is running the company to the ground
good,"That was about it, Culture and management styles are awful. Micromanaging you do death. Managers arent on the same page and pull you different directions."
good,"Management isn't transparent about their pay scale they keep employees in the dark regarding important information. Micromanagement defined is their style, they ended all employee pay for perform incentives which really made this a bad place to work. The good was we could ""dress down"" daily and listen to music while performing daily duties. Company did a massive layoff and the method manager RC  went about notifying employees(Had a rep go desk to desk while everyone watched, felt like a slaughterhouse) was just foul and unprofessional. The Sales Reps and Field support centers were never on the same page regarding policies and procedures which always made work such a joy. Management weren't consistent with companies policies allowing Sales rep to be pacified. No room for advancement or schedule changes and management didn't care what you had going on in your personal life. Most enjoyable part of job was Friday nights getting ready for the weekend. Quality/management always found the most ridiculous reasons to reduce your scores. The compliance/reliability is a joke they don't understand people have to step away to the bathroom or grab a drink or just breath sometimes!!"
good,"Working in a local office there was no training for administration, the only advancement was to the stressful sales world, and the pay was not adequate for the area. ADT still has employees in sales that rob the customer and the company. The installation and service teams are  decent departments that have team members that work very hard. The administration department in the office I worked in was a very poor environment due to management. I understand that it's not like this in every local office. There is room to advance if you relocate to one of the places that has ADT, which wasn't the case for me. The company was recently taken over and since that happened the outlook just seems gloomy. While I was there I did enjoy some of my co-workers, who are still friends."
good,Good starter job but not for the long haul as too many scheduling issues that arise and the people answering the phone calls get the fallout and shouted at and cussed out regularly by customers upset by scheduling issues.
good,"Helping customers and internal field technicians daily. Learned a lot about technical support on security systems. Poor Management, not honest with employees and a lot of employee hostile policies. Best part of the job is my co-workers and working to keep people safe and secure in their homes."
good,Corporate is not concerned with livelyhood of field sales reps.They will offer specials to customers that phone in and purchase that sales reps can not offer.
good,While working at ADT had to learn how to be detail oriented and data accuracy. managements was not always on same page with all agents. company would enforce new policies mid year and not take into considerations how it was impacting us.
good,The people are really nice but the management could be better. The hours of work could be better also.  The people are really nice that i work with and I feel that i have made friends for life
good,"Poco salario, sólo sirve si sos sólo y recién comenzaste a trabajar."
good,"I was contacted by a recruiter to come work here, was told I would make 65,000+ per year and that the sales are basically guaranteed. Most everything was a lie. They do have great benefits though."
good,"Job is very stressful, dealing with customers who systems don't work but ADT doesn't want to send techs to the homes of the people who have coverage. Or have an elderly person trying to change a battery or risk a fall while trying to trouble shoot a smoke detector on a 12 foot ceiling who has Parkinson's or had a stroke."
good,I had a great boss until the Corporate Restructuring came in and they let him go. It seems at ADT you are just a number and they really don't care about the employee. I never felt that way until recently when they did a mgmt. change
good,Working at ADT they were strict on taking calls back to back and not getting a breather in between calls they also made mandatory overtime and if you missed your shift by a few minutes or didn't come till your actual shift started and you'll get penalized for it. The new CEO of ADT made the job horrible to work for.
good,Es un buen lugar de trabajo. Con posibilidades de adquirir conocimiento y experiencia.
good,"Good company with good name recognition, but the compensation is very low.  Very low base salary and very low commissions.  I sell to commercial accounts and we outsource all our installs to a local security guy.  He always says we didn't include enough labor, wire, parts, etc.   That all comes out of my commissions.   The training they provide is not good and does not cover all the pricing tools.  My 1st few quotes that I sold to customers didn't have any labor costs because our tool in PA didn't price the labor based on zip code like it is supposed to do."
good,Metric-based sales environment with a strong emphasis on meeting goals. Very stat driven. Fielding inbound calls and attempting to convert customer service calls to sales calls.
good,Trabaje muy libremente ya que nadie me daba ordenes¡¡¡yo sabía que hacer en mis obligaciones laboral....lamentablemente se fueron de mza
good,It is a company that like any other has its ups and downs. Mainly management growth and other portions of the job seem to be a bit misunderstood. In need of reevaluate
good,"Great place to work, very comfortable office space. Utilized cutting edge technology. Management style promoted team work and recognized individual achievement."
good,"A typical day at work in service department includes getting my jobs on a handheld and go about my day to complete 5 to 7 jobs per day. I've learned a lot during my time with ADT because of my exposure to a lot of systems that were installed by other companies.  "
good,"ADT is changing their structure and their investor, what that means is all the budgets are being shaved including the pay plans.  In the 12 years of being in direct sales for ADT the pay plans have changed each time for the worse 8 different times... and it will again in 2018.  I was able to build my business with over 3000 clients , and maintain above my monthly quotas.  We are doing the same amount of sales but making half of what I normally make.  The market is open for new options."
good,No company advancements...Hours were decent however sales leads were diminished due t lack of management. Went to remote location and was not ale to change infrastructure to keep good sales team.
good,"As my job i needed to walk to houses, knock and talk to the person in charge, i offered ADT services, asked what they wanted and gave my number for future contact with anything."
good,"long hours"
good,Good company to gain experience as entry level call center agents. Small room for growth (more on a who you know basis). Daily prayer before work will be needed and advised.
good,You have to make a lot of sales calls which require long hours and less time at home.It was very beneficial if you made alot of sales but not real good if you did'nt make enough sales. ADT is quite stressful in my opinion.
good,"This was my first job, the office culture was stilted and quite inflexible, most people worked 9 to 5, I don't recall much flexibility on staff working hours."
good,This was a great company that I worked at for a number of years. I was able to move to different areas with in the company. & they even paid to relocate me due to a closer of the office I was at.
good,"I would work for ADT at any day. Challenging but one needs to concentrate at job at hand. Give your best. Management and staff supportive. Meet deadlines, that is important"
good,"Overall the job was enjoyable when there was sufficient staff. Initial and ongoing training was adequate to provide the customers with good service. Unfortunately being a 24/7/365 workplace, for some staff having a good work/life balance was difficult."
good,"must be very very driven or you will not succeed in this sales industry. must be people person work long hours even though you wont get paid for them, and alot of traveling"
good,"Put together cards for mail outs, make preset lists for mailers and door knocking and phone calls."
good,"Assisted in setting up and coordinating of events held by ADT. Went b2b informing home owners, about ADT security systems and product sales. Which would also benefit ther home insurance."
good,"Worked here for a number of years.. Many Technicians here have long tenures..Reputable company, but does not take consideration of Technicians in terms of their family responsibilities.. great place to work if you are single with no kids. Long hours most days.. No one really takes accountability for any mistakes whether simple mistakes or major mistakes. Management is always under pressure, therefore you will be under pressure."
good,A good starting point for a typical call center environment. Good people to work with but change is constant. Pay has gotten better over time and benefits are pretty good. Not a bad place to work at.
good,"The job was OK for the compensation. Not much opportunity for advancement. I had to get a high security clearance and had to drive a little out of the way, but it was worth it."
good,A very strong sales environment with opportunities for advancement. Sales managers should provide incremental growth over his/her tenure with the company.
good,A job is a job. Sometimes you have coworkers who are easy to get along with and sometimes not. I found an opening with a friend at another place so I moved to better myself.
good,"Worked here for a long time with favorable results.Numerous changes in management and corporate dictated how things were done on a daily basis.The bottom line was that work got done! I left due to the fact that the local Union tried to get a foothold in ADT. Certain individuals were not content with actually working,so they tried to gain the sympathy of the union. It didn't work, but it divided the local ADT office. That is why I had to leave."
good,"Start the day by replying all e-mails that came through after I left work. Work through any paperwork that was left on my desk for checking and signing off. Speak to individuals about any problems they may be experiencing and assist where I can. I learned a lot and was provided with skills to best do my job. Workplace culture was pleasant, friendly people."
good,Been with them for 8 years been successful in spite of leadership can be a very stressful position if quotas aren't met. Upper management applies gen ours amount of pressure to succeed
good,Nothing to say. It was a job for the time being and i didn't see a career there. I planned on leaving after this year. Thank you for your time and have a great day
good,company is going through a take over and things are changing rapidly. not necessarily in a good way. management is two faced. good compensation and benefits. feel like a number.
good,"In n ""Us against them"" environment somebody will surly fail. Install managers don't know much about installing. Installers look for reasons to not do the job and walk off. Installers won't answer their phones or communicate to sales team when additional information is needed. Sales manager wants ""units"" not sales. Larger jobs get look down on because they take more time to do. If you want to sell 2 door contactors and a motion sensor, this is the job for you. They will love your productivity. It's a daily grind, diamond sales job."
good,"ADT is not a company that respects family values and do not provide flexibility.  The salary, however, is comparable to most businesses and allows opportunities for advancement."
good,"If you are fine with commission based employment and you like to work independently, setting up sales appointments and closing deals on your own, this is the ideal position for you. If you are concerned about people and safety in the home and business this is definitely the right job for you."
good,"Took calls from owners of alarm systems, troubleshoot issues, notify fire or police if necessary. Was a brief experience for me as the call center locally was closed less than 1 year after I started with them."
good,Can be a good atmosphere to work in. Some managers are great some are not very attentive. Too many changes in the last year or so have left a bad taste is the mouths of many employees.
good,Benefits are good as well as 401 k Hard to get that 5 percent match these days. The place is a ghetto. They keep hiring the same kids over and over again. Most of the complaints I think are from the younger generation. The work ethic is not there. Most of them violate company rules on a daily basis. Cell phones out while talking to customers for example.In some spots a party atmosphere. Dressing like they are home and going to the Gym.Managers look the other way except for a few. Its the I do what I want to do. when I want to do it attitude.New management is taking over and the culture might change.I was treated fine as a employee and opportunities are there if you are willing to work. Its a decent place to work with good benefits its the environment that needs to change and the attitude of the people they hire.
good,Overall stable company but frequent turnover in executive leadership creates confusion at the field level. Frequent reorganizations prevents real progress from being made.
good,Had a good career with them.  Enjoyed working with my peers.  Our Center always made our numbers. Company used to be like family but that has faded away.
good,"I found the overall envirornment unsettling, people talking and disrupting while your attemping to do your job...other people horseing around...the best part of the job was educating customers of their responsibility of payment and service of their equipment"
good,"i like working there as am always helping others with any alarms emergency . its good when you know your help others, co-workers are good and helpful"
good,"If you are a people oriented and like meeting new people than this is a job you will enjoy. Management is great and it is not recommended with no experienced in field sales.  For those who love working from home and like getting paid for the value of the work they do then yes, it is ideal."
good,Aprendí a coordinar diferentes tareas en simultaneo y a efectuarlas con seguridad y eficiencia.
good,Management lacks but has potential. Pay could be structured in better terms. Benefits are good to very good. Safety very good.
good,"ADT Security is an awesome company.  Very good benefits and compensation is above average for Puerto Rico jobs and if you put in the hours."
good,There is a strong lack of understanding and disconnect with people at this company. To a point that its almost comical. No one really understands the difficulty of life or any issues that may arise.
good,"ADT is a high risk enviroment to work in, long hours and different shifts to work."
good,"Underpaid"
good,"Demanda mucha vida personal, trabajaba de lunes a lunes y no manejaba mi horario, nos llevaban a terreno obligado a diferentes  zonas y no siempre podía ir nuevamente a ver a  los contactados"
good,I love to work for commission but leadership was not good. have to keep up with call volumes that aren't correct. Management changes their mind daily as to what to expect employees to do. Mandatory meetings sometimes out of town.
good,"ADT as a company is a great place to work, many good opportunities, benefits and stability. Sometimes it is not the entire company that has faults, however, there are always great opportunities in particular areas of large companies."
good,We work hard to ensure our customers recieved the Best Service possible.  Our team works together to ensure great Customer expierience.
good,I haven't worked for this company in a while and can only base my review upon the time I was there. The co-workers made the job likeable. I did enjoy the feeling of being able to help save a life and safety by monitoring someone's home.
good,"A typical day was a Monday meeting at the office at 8:00 and then follow up with clients and make sales calls the remainder of the week.. There was also a meeting on Friday's at 2:00"
good,As ADT the company had the customers best interest in mind As Tyco the environment became more of a corporate atmosphere.
good,"This was a sales job and we had to be out of the office often to make, and close deals. My manager was very supportive and high energy. Typical day start out from home to design locations or seek some to sign up for security. I learn a lot about cameras and security systems. Co- workers were good to go but I hardly saw them. Hardest part about job was to keep going after someone leads you on and doesn't buy. The most enjoyable part about the job was when someone that seem disinterested in buying buys"
good,"I worked with ADT through a temp agency and the job was very monotonous.  I was required to assist the project managers on their respective site projects dealing with purchase orders and install packages.  Had to calculate the technicians rates based on the work done and site location.  The management didn't seem to in tact when I was there, as responsibility was kind of just passed down the line without much clarification.  It was a typical 9-5 office job.  Hardest part of the job was getting any satisfaction or acknowledgement out of it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers at ADT."
good,This is a very good job to get you through whatever financial situation you are in however that is all. This company lacks upward mobility and customer obsession that is a key component/factor to customer service.
good,"The day consists of cold calling on self generated leads and follow ups on company generated leads. I learned a more concise way of conducting a sales call with the model sales call created by ADT. I also learned about my own sales capabilities. "
good,"ADT was a well compensating job for someone that had time to put in for the company. The travel was the only downside about the job that I never got used to. I was starting a family of my own and always out of town, but it did pay very well."
good,the only draw back is the base salary very low and in the current economic not a good place for family persons to work.
good,install up to three alarm systems a day some with pulse so they can control there alarm with a smart phone.
good,The fine art of closing is key to financial rewards with this company.  The most difficult part about this job is micro-management.
good,"While my specific team manager was fantastic, overall ADT does not seem to value its employees as much as other companies.  There was no base salary and the company would not pay you unless the job was completely done.  Even if a sale had been made, if the customer had to reschedule the installation, or if the installer failed to show up (both things out of the control of the sales person), you would not see a paycheck.  There was the constant threat of termination if quotas were not met, regardless of external circumstances.  There also seemed to be a big disconnect between customer service, sales, and installation departments.  Since my departure, almost everyone on my team (including my manager) has moved on to a different company."
good,Overworked underpaid; fun while working with customers. Learned to problem solve well.
good,aswer customer calls assist tech and customer with any question they may have and assist tech with job info and scheduling
good,"At ADT there was always a new procedure. Our manager did not always deliver this information to the employees properly, so we would have to learn by trial and error. My typical work day consist of printing out contracts, scheduling appointments for potential customers, making outbound calls to current customers as well as potential customers, editing contracts for new customers"
good,"My review would start with a typical day at work. I'd come in and greet my fellow employees and team managers, come to my seat then begin to start my daily tasks. Restart my computer to clock in, upload my applications to pull up customer accounts, log into my phone, then begin taking inbound calls for customers. The day would go on with vigerous activity that would normally include answering high calls in que, navigating though many systems, keeping up with your break and lunches, etc. I'd normally be wore out by the end of the day ! After assisting customers with billling issues and brief technicalities my day was over and i was ready to go home. Now my day at ADT would consist of either that or a company carnival/luncheon which was always nice !"
good,"Senior leadership is weak and taking the company in a bad place. In the centers, people have high expectations, work hard and are dedicated to the customers."
good,I would set up appointments to any customer that has requested more information on the web site.
good,"I started with the early morning shift, very pleasant. My direct manager was very knowledgable in the field which help make my job efficient. I got along very well with my co-workers. The best part of my jod is when I got off the phone with a very satified customer.  The hardest part of my job is when I couldn't help each and every customer due to policy and proceedures."
good,"Having merged Brinks customers, changes are still in progress stilted communication of said changes from the higher ups to those facing the adjustments."
good,"i went on appointments made by company to upsell them from their old security systems to the new pulse systems"
good,"I work for ADT as an overnight operator, and its like I don't exist...well except when I make a mistake...then its all over the news. I have learned to speak with patience with customers and while there are benefits to working late at night (Get to wear Jeans, not speak with a ""robotic"" voice aka  script) there are some cons. Like when we try to apply for a position outside of over nights, its like your stuck in groundhogs day. "
good,"a typical day at work is ok i suppose. Every company has its issues. Amongst the management team, there is not much of moitvation to staff and the management team is not very staff orientated. lazy and passes the buck all the time, does not support staff should there be a serious issue. The hardest part of my job is to call clients after they have been broken into or been assaulted or armed robbed... because its very traumatic for them and its hard to not feel what they feel."
good,Ruime ervaring opgebouwd als accountmanager en vestigingsleider binnen een multinational.
good,I would input our customer's information into the computer on a daily basis. I learned how to manage my workday according to the needs of the day. I also did the billing @ the end of every month. I issued credits to accts when they were billed incorrectly.
good,"Typical day is calling and running appointments either set by the company or set by me."
good,There is a lot of favoritism within the company and they do not treat their employees fairly.
good,"Buena experiencia y ademas aprender sobre alarmas, buen ambiente y trato con ejecutivos, buen espacio, y valor humano"
good,"No support given, management no approachable.  No job security"
good,guaranteed 40 hrs. decent benefits package. pay scale  needs to be raised.
good,"The employees are great and work very hard. Upper management, not so great.  Amazing how some directors don't show up to work and are unreachable. Never taken to the carpet for that.  The workplace is disjointed.  Employees are given little to no direction.  Just pray you're doing the right thing. Lots of perks for employees.  Great building.  Best part of the job."
good,"Good teamwork, but no benefits. Going door to door to sale ADT was fun cause I love helping people, but the restrictions were preventing me to allow most people to get this service cause of their credit witch prevented me to get paid."
good,The job is constantly changing with new duties added weekly. sadly they do no financially compensate for the changes.  Work ours can be a bit challenging and the lack of clarity of policies are very unprofessional.
good,"A typical day at work could be frustrating and tiring but the main focus is to help out individuals who constantly getting their homes getting broke into. I learned that being a Sales Representative you got to sell your self instead of your customers selling you and so you got to be patient and listen to them be pleasant at the same time. The hardest part of the job is walking and continue walking until you find that one person who is interested in our ADT Home Security System but if you dnt find that person , it could really mess up your day. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning and interacting with certain individuals and making relations."
good,I work 6 days a week. A typical day is making at least 50 touches through calls and door tagging. Also throughout the day I have client appointments and do security assessments. In this job I have learned that I do like being challenged and getting the opportunity to learn new things. The hardest part of the job is the compensation. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to meet new people and always getting the ability to learn new things.
good,Collections Calls
good,"The management is extremely poor, the company has different departments that tend to work against each other making it a tense unproductive work environment."
good,"I had worked for Coca-Cola for 18 years before joining ADT. I had no idea about security work when i joined them. They sent me to learn the security business down in Allanta. I came back with an idea of what to do and they worked with me for a good month before sending me out on my own. I worked with some fine people who helped me along the way. The issues i had was that upper management was not big on being real helpful when i needed it most with a customer. They saw everything in back & white and as we know, that not always the case."
good,"I get to work sit in my cubical, and start taking in calls. I set up appointments for those who are interested in getting ADT services. We also do follow up calls to existing customers or answer any questions they may have."
good,Working under pressure and make sure we meet target as set out by management.
good,"My typical day at work would entail, after our feed of invoices drop into the billing system, create a spreadsheet for back up of my work load. I go through all the accounts and copy and paste to Excel for easy research of back up documentation and contract pulls. I work from System to system so that I am not back tracking my daily work and print, research, document the invoice, make corrections, handle write offs and continue forward. After I process my feed, I then either offer assistance to my coworkers or my collector. I process credits and debits collapsing and balancing my accounts. Make notes where needed and necessary. Provide documentation to management when needed for valid proof of activity. Work with our National Sales staff located outside of the surrounding states. I handle Large accounts, typically over 5k sites.The hardest part of my job is never having enough time in the day to do what I have to and not work overtime."
good,"if you dont have a famil this job is good money and ideal for you, I on the other hand just needed more stable income seeing as I do have a family."
good,"Because this was a Call Center with many members (400) and teams, management was create contest and the best call, explain the product, offer assistance and/ upgrades for customer satisfaction"
good,"Company is focused on the business matters before customer service,, which changed from previous job requirements"
good,Everyday had a new problem to solve which I learned to escalate to management if it was beyond my decision making.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with changes to technology. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with questions about their billing and contract.
good,"The Company has had a great deal of changes over the last few years and the challenge that the industry has faced, has been tremendous and it's success has been mostly due to the effort of the employees and managers working together for a better future."
good,"Calling 100-150 calls a day"
good,Occupation allows for remote work if needed. Great environment and fun place to work. Left alone most of the time to complete your work with little micro management.
good,"Facile , Bon produit mais faux aimer faire du  porte a porte pour la sollicitations"
good,"I consider it unethical to review, in depth, previous employers for anyone other than that employer.  Every employee/employer has idiosyncrasies, some good, some not so good.  Some employees are well suited for a position and some employees are not.  The best employers learn the strengths and weaknesses of each employee, and places them in a position to maximize their proficiencies and provide the opportunity to strengthen other skills to an acceptable level of proficiency."
good,"If you work and can sell, you can make a lot of money. However, post sale is MUCH more difficult than making the actual sale. The installers are over worked and can easily blow out your job if they’re just not feeling it that day."
good,"Flexible and very supportive environment. a lot to learn via on line training module and by the manager.flexible work hours, Lots of reward and recognition by the management."
good,Working and my experience with ADT has been a journey. I have learned a lot. Peers at work made the work place feel like our second home. Everyone helped each other. It was a good learning environment.
good,Muy buena experiencia laboral. Recomendable.  Viaticos pagos. Capacitación constante.
good,Worked amongst various groups in the office. Days were flexible and was split up amongst being in the field with direct reports and office responsibilities.
good,"in general the work environment is good but there is a clash between the company's values and the culture. also, there is a lack of fluent communication between departments and that makes it difficult to provide the optimal service in a timely manner"
good,Managing five Team managers to support 60 to 75 associates in order to assist customers with billing and service questions.  Ensure that the customers are receiving great customer service.
good,it can be a great place to work and management tries to keep a positive environment. upper management places a competitive pay plan where doing your job can actually cost you more money than short cutting or avoiding calls.
good,I did not enjoy this job because of the constant turnover in the jobs I recruited for. The work environment was not collaborative and i was given no direction.
good,"ADT is not a company for the faint at heart.  Daily tasks and requirements outweighs what is actually possible for you to accomplish in a day.  The number one priority for me is handling all my customers with the utmost service in all aspects of whatever they need.  Unfortunately, this type of customer service and work ethic is not always promoted or welcomed.  When your paycheck relies on other people, it can be difficult to get used to but you learn to work smarter and more independent than you ever have before. I love my team members and my install/service team, without each other things don't get done."
good,"The potential is there to make great money. It is only 'potential' because it is mostly commissions and bonus with a small base pay. If you have a bad month, and that will happen, you don't make anything. You need to have several months of savings set aside to be fiscally safe here."
good,"I would work at any call center but this one, I believe the only reason I lasted so long was because of tuition reimbursement. The managers are decent and benefits as well"
good,Any person who works in sales will tell you that you should pay attention to the comp plan. Pay attention to the comp plan. ADT has the mindset that $30k a year is a lot to pay someone and that it means you should be doing 2-3 other people's jobs.
good,"Most people who work there are very nice people - but the company is a big corporation that requires managers to micro manage everything. It's all about the numbers, how many calls you take, how much paperwork you get done, even when you clock in from breaks or go to the toilet- down to the second!  Many people start in the customer service call center- and it is back to back calls without break- so as you can imagine, it's stressful."
good,A lot of changed in the past 3 years. Turn over rate is high after the company has been bought out. Management is not the same. The pay increased only because employees were being under paid.
good,The hardest part of working for ADT was achieving a balance of work and your personal life. Due to the company being 24 hours your work schedule could vary at any time and when mandatory overtime is required you would have to make sure that you have backup plans for your backup plan.
good,"Stressful, system goes down too much, always was the last to know about changes. It was pleasant to work there at the beginning and then it got really bad."
good,Had great comp plan and manager. New ownership changed all of that. Threatened all jobs of Adt employees eventually taking most of them. Would have stayed for life before this
good,ADT is a nice place to work. I put 9 years in before my position was discontinued. Would not have left this employer otherwise. The environment varies by location and the interactions you choose to participate in.
good,If you enjoy working in a call center environment with laid back dress code this is the place for you.  The pay at ADT is fair however the health care is terrible.  You can be stuck with a bad schedule for years because they don't do a lot of shift bids.
good,"Needed to have better managers who were mature and dedicated to assisting reps be the best they can be. I left due to the atmosphere, it was unprofessional"
good,the environment is very calm and relaxed but can get busy especially on mondays and fridays . the pay can be more especially for the type of work i did. the benefits cans be a little better too.
good,"The three problems ADT had were-- 1. they could not keep managers;  2. We got paid the following week for all sales we turned in by the end of the week.  The problem with that was if a customer had buyer's remorse and cancelled a sale, we got a chargeback.  And third, right after I began working at ADT, they took away our access to the data base which showed which houses had a security system.  I needed to know that so I could call on those homes and set appointments."
good,I believe there is growth potential in the company. I learned a lot since a started at the company. i believe the most challenging part of my job is to keep the client happy at all times.the most enjoyable part of my work as a manager is when i did something for one of my subordinates i you can see the genuine appreciation on their faces.
good,You must be able to adapt to changes. It is a great company to work for but you need to make sure that you are here every day. It plays a big part in your career.
good,You have to work there to understand what goes on there .... you have to go work there to find out ... ok its an unprofessional place. all the mangers are rude and the environment is hostile its so high school everyone sleeps with everyone .. mangers too .. its just who you know how to fit in the crowd .. fights and just apply there and you will see if you get hired ..
good,"Answering phones"
good,You do not have a cubicle and a regular phone to use. Not a very organize Sales Office. My Sales Manager is young and unexperience and could not motivate his sales team on selling the product.
good,Decent organization. I experienced a lot of management change and a cold culture from an HR perspective. Nepotism and favoritism were profound. Benefits package was competitive.
good,"not open for discussion, rather keep my own opinions and allow room for self evaluation. Everyone is different and process job cultures differently. I may have my opinions, others will have theres."
good,"Originally provided flexible schedule with appointments scheduled and commission only, paid on my sales. After separation from Tyco, parent company, required 40 hours week and calling 150 cold calls every Tuesday evening. So job changed but pay structure remained the same, commission for sales sold only."
good,"Sales are sales. ADT offers a great opportunity to those who are organized and strong with Direct sales and lead development. If you cannot handle generating your own leads, you will be buried."
good,"Busy and stressful job role dealing with endless customer complaints because of a poor or lack of good customer service by the company. "
good,"-must be willing to travel a lot"
good,"It is a fast pace place to work..high volume always changing . It is a very tough environment to work in, but well worth the challenge. Adt is a well know brand so it sells itself"
good,"Working at ADT was something i decided to leave, as i was unhappy with the work/life balance and there was not much room for improvement from the position i was in. Although i decided to dis-continue this venture i would definitely would not regard at as a mistake. In my 5 month role i learned a lot and i am glad i could receive some experience in that field of work. I now feel ready to put my all into another role which fits me better."
good,Only way to get paid is by the security systems you sell there is no hourly pay. Your a door to door sells person in the sun all day in the ghetto and new developments.
good,When I started I was told that I would be busy and had job security. The last 3 months I was there I was only getting 15 to 20 hours a week. I got laid off due to how slow the work got. I was told it was due to the merger from where they were bought.
good,It's a typical corporate culture with the additions to a few perks to help with the work life balance.  Friendly and welcoming environment to assist in collaborative efforts.
good,"Its a call center, not much to say besides that. You have to come in to work earlier than your shift to find a seat in our section. Most cases there will not be one. The manager I had was pretty cool but not all of them are. Your on the phone all day, as it is a call center."
good,I have been thoroughly pleased with my time at ADT. There have been some major changes in the last few months. ADT has provided m an opportunity to meet great people.
good,Spent a lot of time away from home. I did not really like the concept of the way they set jobs up. Seemed to me to be a bit of a scam. enjoyed the guys a worked with and also met some really nice people.
good,"ADT is ran like the military, NO one is going to baby sit you; there are times if feels old yet, with lots of hard work you can make Dreams come true."
good,"management was nice but they are no longer there."
good,"Overall good work environment, Improvement with management could be better as well as flexible work hours. Supervisor's are really understandable co-workers were really nice ."
good,Busy call center - over 300 employee's in the las vegas office. Monthly rewards and ongoing training. Good culture. Great work schedules.
good,"Good management, had a way to get structure in each day.  The installers were great, all very professional and good with customers. It is a real ""hustle"" job, no time to build relationships."
good,Bueno en esta empresa aprendí mucho pero el trato a los trabajadores no era el indicado
good,you are expected to work the load of 3-4 people. they expect more and more out of you. you mean nothing to them. management doesn't listen to you at all. the obviously pick and choose their favorites. management sleeps with employees.
good,"It was a good experienced, also learn how to work with team. Working as a sales representative makes me busy, bring out challenging and makes me more productive in the society. The hardest part was the challenges we face every single days when we are out."
good,"A typical day at work was taking in bound calls scheduling service calls as needed, dealt with troubleshooting and assisted with billing issues as well. I've learned that regardless of the type of situation a customer is always right. Management was poor, unfortunately when a customer requested higher management besides a supervisor there wasn't a body on site they had to be transferred to another state. My coworkers were great we always attempted to help each other and work as a team to make everyday a better and productive day. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting  because 80% of the customers were elderly and most of them hard of hearing. The most enjoyable part of the day was the satisfaction of being able to assist a customer and have all the tools needed to succeed."
good,Fast paced inbound call center with some very enthusiastic team leads. Maintained monthly reviews of call stats. Team leads and managers were very vocal. Sometimes hard to get help when needed
good,"ADT, is the nation’s largest security service provider for residential and small business, provides services like monitoring system, alarm system and sensor system. ADT has several applications prospect registration, quotation, customer registration, sales, payments, claims and rebate. TELEMAR application is for tale marketing and ADT Customer service web based application which is developed using JAVA to request quotation and security system and ADT payment application to pay the bill online, for claims and rebates."
good,Worked 4-6 days a week in fields going door to door to offer security to both residential and business customers. Enjoyed my experience in security sales
good,Too many mangers with no knowledge of the security industry and becoming too reliant on emailing or online courses rather than face to face and hands on
good,"Fun work place with supportive collegues. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,"Very stressful, but manageable; Targets needs to be made; The work load not the problem; management is the problem don't know how to manage there staff members; Salary is poor"
good,"My typical day at work would be booking appointment with customers, taking complains, coordinating and assigning jobs to technicians, dealing with guard calls and confirming appointments for installation all over Canada. Staying there for a full years feels like Ive been there for 5 years, thats how much I learned. I've really developed myself and I am able to be professional and deal with difficult situations on the phone or in an office place. I've learnt to work fast while doing a great job. Co-workers are very important to me, I am very independent and work well alone but I am also a huge team player. I LOVE working to people, my co-workers and I weren't just co-workers but friends that will help each other to make the day easier. The hardest part of the job I would say was at the beginning taking about 150-180 calls in a row, as time passed by it became a lot earlier. The most enjoyable part of the job was having on the phone all our technicians all over Canada to keep your day entertaining all day."
good,No room for advancement hard to make more money growth is limited. Management is divided there;s some great managers then there's really bad ones as well.
good,"A day at ADT is taking calls from the time you clock in until the time you clock out. You learn something new everyday because even though the call are repetitive they are sometimes different in their own way. Management is helpful when you need them. Some of my co-workers are what make a day there being the best part. The hardest part would have to be the call volumes because it can get aggravating. The most enjoyable part is that the job is very easy, the café and some of my co-workers."
good,It is structured productive environment with a large influx of calls.  I learn alot about our equipment. Our management is always there when we need them. The hardest job of my job is the hours and working every weekend.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, bien remunerado, buenos seguros colectivos, fiestas de fin de año divertidas."
good,When I started working here is was a good company. Now that they have changed our commission structure it is not the best. There is no salary only commission only which I agreed to. But when the installers can control your money it is not right. If the install doesn't finish a job you don't get paid when you are supposed to. Also if the close out the job late you have to wait an extra week to get paid. It is just not fair. They change install appointments to a time when no one will do the install.
good,"ADT is a ok company to work for always busy, call after call talking to techs not customers giving install confirmations"
good,"A typical day at ADT Security Services, log into about nine systems that provide different tasks for each unique call for the day. I learned how to effectively get the job done with-out taking any shortcuts or deviations from the original way the task were taught. The most enjoyable part of the job is that ADT really considers your health, they have many different programs offered to their employees to get well and stay well."
good,"Inside and outside sales. You get out of it what you put in to it. Management is okay but typical sales environment. When making sales the paychecks are good, when not making sales then you suffer."
good,"Trabaje 5 años en esta empresa, tuve buenos ingresos los 2 primeros años, después,vino una serie de cambios en el contrato, anexos que fueron disminuyendo mis ingresos, sumado a que el mercado se amplio, y llegaron empresas agresivas, como verisure"", las ventas en adt, fueron bajando."
good,not a good place to work lots of workplace drama lots of nepotism and workplace friend promotions if your not kissing your managers butt you will not get promoted
good,"Typical day of work consists of attending appointments booked both by myself and the outbound telesales team. after attending the appt i would then have to design a quotation according to the specification found once i had attended the site."
good,"Work day starts off with daily conference call with team to report sales from previous work day, sales visits for the day, and total sales for month."
good,"Nice people to work with, but the communication between different levels of management and departments could be better."
good,The job with ADT was challenging and rewarding at the same time.  Some of the customers could be really hard to handle but then the customers that I spoke with that was so grateful for the help made it all worth it at the end of the day.
good,Company branch has good management. Con- advancement is slim
good,"When the company was Tyco there were many perks, different positions, room for growth.  Since the split and ADT has become a stand alone company and the changes are daily and drastic.  There's no promising future here."
good,"Explicaciones formativas."
good,"no es del todo fiable ya que al mes no llegaban a pagar, la gente era amable, y yo decidia donde dirigir al equipo en busca de nuevas afiliaciones a la empresa"
good,"Great people to work for, always someone there if help is needed."
good,"I enjoyed working for ADT; They have very flexible schedules and an uncapped potential for earning with a friendly social environment. Management at ADT and company growth was and seems to be the biggest challenge for representatives. The company has restructured to where it is going away from direct sales agents and is focusing on more of a call center structure; which has forced a great deal of previous ADT sales representatives to seek employments through the competition. But for the most part, I honestly enjoyed working for ADT."
good,Liked working here because it kept me active and fit. I actually looked forward to going to work while I was working here.
good,"Call center atmosphere, scheduling technicians across the country to service non-functioning alarm systems.  I now have great customer service skills, strong work ethic.  Management hand picks who will get promoted.  The co-workers helped get through the day.  The hardest part was knowing there was a time that no matter how ""above and beyond"" I would work, I wasn't going to get promoted or shown appreciation."
good,"I loved my Coworkers, but the incentives and the policy's were a bit elementary. The company didn't really seem to care about correcting issues that were their customers number one complaints, and they didn't offer much in the way of office morale. You know your a number at ADT and its a revolving door. Its sad to see such a huge company practice that way."
good,"Buena experiencia, el trabajo lo realizaba desde mi domicilio, con listado de clientes aportado por la empresa."
good,"I enjoyed working here on the days that management does not scream and shout at you. I have learned time management and enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my work was when you get shouted at for no apparent reason, but I made sure I enjoyed what ever job was send my way."
good,"Being able to help the client and assisting them with their queries,"
good,"Very busy, one will always be on the phone"
good,I like EDO. Talked on several real alarms! I don't like the point we have to wake people out of there sleep to tell them their battery is low. The main point when I just gave up on this job is when they made me go to a new dept for customer service which I tell people how to fix their alarms.  People get a way with a lot and some of the reps talk to them customers like they jst don't care. 
good,I've learned to be discipline and respect job and my superiors.
good,"must be taken seriously, can be stressful, need to hire more older adults as it tends to be clickish with so many young adults"
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of traveling going to places and advertising our services to different people in different towns. The co-workers are good, open and team workers. Management has their loop holes but okay even though its not up to the standard of my expectations. The hardest part of the job is going to a place advertise the services and no body buys them and the most enjoyable part is when people sign up for our services after an advertisement of the services."
good,"great sales experience, but long hours and 100% commission"
good,"I worked in two different positions in the company and I have to give a very positive review to my position as Regional Admin. Good Manager, good enviroment and loads of support from Corporate."
good,"Each day varied based on company appts. Morning would consist of follow up calls from doors knocked or previous appts. If appt was scheduled, would go to customer's home and conduct a model sales call. This included a series of steps including questions to further understand the customers needs and concerns. I would then establish a level of protection with the customer as well as a budget. A walk through would then be conducted to look for areas of concern and specifically see what doors/windows the customer wants convered. At that point I would create a security plan that met the customers needs and budget then close the sale. Complete paperwork and schedule the installation."
good,Friendly environment. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of job is the continous change of policys and trying to maintain a customer friendly environment while going through these changes of policys.
good,"High turnover, poor management, little respect for employees and service department that is out of control."
good,"All about new cutomers--- Lots of micromanaging, but the pay i very good. Not the worst job."
good,"Very Great Place to work but very strict for example if you miss your break then you just miss your break, if you miss your lunch then you ruin your call productivity which can result in a write up, calls are monitored and graded, in which will determine if you get written up or not. The training class moves relatively fast so pay attention. Company does not accept doctors notes."
good,.when my team make an arrest and save client assets
good,a typical day at work would involve an hour meeting then a lunch break before walking around for hours door-to-door to sell alarms. i learned to accept rejection better and control my temper. the management there is more on a friend level but the workers are very nice and fun to be around. the hardest part of the job was the commission paycheck and not having a paycheck every 2 weeks. most enjoyable part of the job is the long van rides with coworkers and learning more about the people you work with.
good,A typical day at work is based on compliance you have to clock in and log into-start working on time. Handle customer accounts dealing with there security systems. Everything is based on you getting your bonus through out the year. But very fast paced
good,"Show up to work, have team meeting get motivated. Transportation is provided to the field. then go door to door. You meet meed good people as well as bad one's. Hardest part is not making a sale and not getting a pay check. You do learn a lot and learn fast."
good,Left ADT due to lack of Customer Service and focus on taking care of employees
good,the typical day was processing alarm signals and trouble shooting with customers.. some of the management was lack luster and some was very helpful and upbeat..the co-workers were upbeat and diligent the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying a customer
good,"ADT Inc., formerly The ADT Corporation, is an American company that provides residential, small and large business electronic security, fire protection, and other related alarm monitoring services in North America. The corporate head office is located in Boca Raton, Florida."
good,"Very demanding and requires the right person that can fit in a corporate setting. You are just a number, literally. They assigned you a MAN NUMBER your first day and it has to be on all your jobs. They strictly adhere to an unfair metrics system that does not take any variables into consideration. I don’t feel like my experience there was very fair but the people that you work WITH are great."
good,Your pay is all commission and base pay install. If you live an hour away from all your jobs your paycheck will barely cover your gas. When you get to install you better upsell or you wont make anything.
good,"Managing ADT project Implementations by providing IT Infrastructure in line with established executive strategies, vision and budget estimates. Responsibility included;"
good,"Knowledgeable team members, open office, but tight on space.  Learned how to implement and troubleshoot issues during the beta process.  Tight time-lines."
good,true outside sales position.  if you hustle you can make some money.  there is a lot of freedom to conduct your day as you please.  not the job for you if you are not a self starter
good,"The day to day tasks such as answering the phone over and over again (you don't just answer the phone, they come in automatically back to back all day long) are soul crushing at best. Your tone, pitch, inflection, keywords, credits, job creation rate, first call resolution, average call time etc are tracked by a software reminiscent to Skynet. Don't worry though, when the calls holding hits over 300 they bring you a slice of cold pizza you can eat in between calls. Did I mention there's no time in between calls? there's also a break room on the second floor that by the time you get to it you have about half of your 15 minute corporate mandated break left, on the plus side they have an Xbox up there that takes 3 minutes to turn on so now you have 5 minutes to get back to your desk. The pay is okay, last year I got a $0.12 per hour raise, so that's something I guess. there's room for advancement in the company but with advancement comes way more responsibility and stress. Enjoy the job for what it is but don't get sucked into staying there forever .."
good,Most of the training received at ADT was completed on-the-job itself. I was able to learn and gather new skills throughout my twenty-plus years of service.
good,"•	Open all mail from the branches and faxes; keep logs of all information received."
good,For a very large organization the day-to-day performance structure and KPI's were not aligned with the customer's needs and the industry they were competing against.
good,Adt offers great pay benefits. All the overtime your looking for and more. Great opportunities for advancement in many different departments within the company.
good,"A typical day at work would start by clocking in, get some coffee, and small talk with friends in the morning. After that, I would get my assigned workload for that day. If management requested for me to more work or help out another department, I would assist other coworkers. The workplace culture was very much like family. Everyone worked out their differences with each other. The hardest part sometimes was how much work and how less work everyone had to share. The most enjoyable part was everyone working well with each other and getting along."
good,"Must have a detailed plan of attack every morning. Would discuss on phone call with mgr. while other reps were listening on the call. Mostly prospective business. Door knocking, phone calls, leave stickers on empty buildings, referral business. Each would be provided a territory in which to work. Leads (if any) would be distributed based upon territory. Quota was 10 Sales/Installations of a Package BGL per month. Any more than this, one would receive added bonuses based upon the number. Resales are very few and far between. Phone sales are made from call centers on new and resales. Business is extremely difficult to find. A business rep could sell residential as well. Training is not very good. Learn as go on a lot of it.    If a company cancelled within 6 months of the sale, ADT would charge back the rep all commission earned."
good,I enjoyed my time her comision only is tough goals are not attainable it is a tough road to make a living some good months but lots of bad in between tought way to make a living
good,"Buena empresa, aunque entres por una administradora de personal, las prestaciones son buenas si llegas a tener la planta sino sigues con tu sueldito sin prestaciones extra. "
good,I only worked there like 3 weeks only. My time there was not that good it was commission only. No hourly pay at all the timing was not good. It was a bad experience.
good,"Very team orientated atmosphere, car allowance, medical benefits, unlimited leads, good bonuses, excellent mentoring by senior sales personel, good combination of cold calling and qualified leads."
good,I was emergency dispatcher. It was simple and easy. The only thing I didn't like is calling people in the middle of the night for a low battery. Training is just like the job.
good,"learnt a lot with adt, but felt no room for promotion and found frustrating, great team I worked with and manager but wanted to move up the ladder"
good,ADT Contracted out to to many partners so a lot of times customers felt they had been called twice. Overall i was responsible for sales and customer education of security products.
good,responsible for working with customers and installing home installation and working with customers one on one to guarantee and satisfaction for the customers.
good,"They try to take care of you, but only if you're making sells, otherwise they are all over you and push for you to work longer and later hours.  They helped me learn I'm not a salesman."
good,This company is great if you have never worked in a call center. they give you a good sense of how call centers work and what is expected everyday in this environment.
good,I didn't mind the job. I wasn't happy as it was a temp job to get me by for the time.I am not a telemarketer but the job felt like it when you had to call and use all the phrases they wanted you to just to get hung up on before you were done with the paragraph you had to recite.
good,"ADT Security Services just acquired Red Hawk in December, 2018.  I do not have enough information to give an accurate account of a full day's work with them."
good,"Not much to say.  Typical day, start at 7.00 am check service maintenance sheets for current month , organize company locations"
good,"I actually enjoyed working here. I worked in a call center environment so it was very fast paced. I took at least 80 call a day. The only thing that I found to be a little bit challenging was the ever changing rules. It like once you get used to the way things work, upper management changes the rules again on you. Cool place to work tho and the pay is decent."
good,"remote visits, helping users, remote support, installations, meetings, hardware support, customer service, procurement, working as a small team, meeting deadlines"
good,"This was a position in residential sales, where you were supplied with a few leads, but had to mostly develop your own or cold call customers to sell the security systems."
good,"Lugar donde puedes aprender no solo del trabajo que está bajo tu responsabilidad, sino que del trabajo de otras sub áreas."
good,ADT is a good company that needs to restructure its sales managers and sales personnel.  By this I mean the company needs to do a better job of letting the sales managers coach and consult more with the salespersons and apply more actual sales techniques
good,"Computer Operator - Network Operations Center"
good,Disorganized and rude managers. Getting ahead is struggle. The perception is not good. Great cafeteria space and food options. Pretty loud and not clean.
good,"Decent job for entry level. Good training program"
good,"The company changed hands many times over the years, and eventually our team was deemed duplicate support staff and we were all laid off after a new CEO was hired and the company had another merger."
good,Did not spend much time with the company - commission only - hard job if your not into sales - or don't like to work on commission - wouldn't recommend to a young person starting a family.
good,Typical day starts around 8 am. We talk about the goals for that week. We go out pass out flyers and we make cold calls. I learned how to up-sale well. The management was good. Culture of the place was laid back. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the installers. Most enjoyable part about the job flexibility of work schedule.
good,"I had a great experience with ADT in Omaha, but not in Tempe. Overall, the compensation and hours were good. The culture in Tempe, AZ was really bad unfortunately so I left the company."
good,really hate this company left Sarasota. it was a really great company ad employed nearly 300 people. the pay wasn't to bad and the benefits were great
good,OK place to work for. Door to door is a challenge around here though. Some leads were 4 hours away. You get out what you put in. Did enjoy ability to schedule your own day
good,"A typical day for this job would include a morning meeting everyday, it would usually last an hour, then after that, my goal was to set one to two appointments per day. This would include calling potential clients or door knocking in neighborhoods within my territory. Each month, the minimum goal was to sell 12 units per month. Six would hopefully be provided by the company and the other six would have to be self generated. The longer you work there, the more self generated business they want you to get."
good,"I went into this job not knowing anything about Call Center life, and I learned that working in a call center and having every single second of your time in the building monitored is NOT for me, on the other hand every manager that I encountered was great they always wanted to help you and they were always willing to learn something new.  The benefits are amazing and the pay is good for what you do, but keep your eye on the clock and don’t let your compliance get low."
good,"Not a fun place to work but management is all about themselves. Very ""clicky"" environment. Too much about the numbers and not so much about the people. Would not work there again."
good,Answering calls from techs in the field installing security systems in homes needing conformation on signals to make sure that the system was working correctly before the tech left the customers home.
good,I made 800 cold calls in 8 months. you have to be fearless on cold calls. a good understanding computer processes. plus the people skills you need with all sales skills
good,"I learned a lot and quickly. Basically fake it till you learn it. Very high paced. I really enjoyed my position here ."
good,"Working for ADT was all about presenting yourself to the customer. A home security specialist has to be confident and knowledgeable of products, home security needs and customer needs/desires."
good,"This is a commission only job.  On occasion, ADT will give a lead. Because ADT was sold to an investment organization, all that matters is the bottom line."
good,"Rapidly worked my way to #1 salesperson in the country, and held it for 27 weeks in a row.  Then I was promoted to closer, and Rocked it."
good,Concise training developer and presenter utilizing various workflows and procedures detailed to organizational needs. Strategic development of business processes and methodologies for system integrated products and services by defining standard operating procedures through high level vendor relationships
good,"Typical day included calling previous customers and trying to get them to purchase new security system service again."
good,"very busy no time off the phone, managers suck,pay is ok  phone calls are always back to back, revolving door alot of people never stay do not work there"
good,"The technicians and Admin work well together. Management sometimes push you to upsell too much, and you work preformance is based off of it. Some days they over book your schedule and you are forced to work late."
good,"You can work hard and get paid well. watch your pay because commission adjustments need to be done a lot. Management picked favorites and gave several leads to them even when they didn't close them. I still received several awards because I worked hard and closed several deals every month until the end. Only worked at the Plymouth location a few months worked in Madison Heights Mi, for over 7years. The hardest part was not being treated fairly and working a lot. the most enjoyable part was visiting new customers everyday and knowing you helped them keep their family safe."
good,Business is open 24 hours so shifts vary for those who can work nights and weekends etc. Job is great for students great benefits and great staff. Training is pretty long but worth the time.
good,"Great hours an benefits, good training all around nice place to work but i not care for the company merging customer service and emergency dispatch without a pay increase, this is why i left."
good,Management  Experience:   Strong  negotiation  skills  with  international    import  and  export  and  over  seven  years  of  experience  handling  logistics   itineraries.  Proficient  in  training  and  managing  suppliers  on  company  processes  and  procedures.  Involved  in  decision  making  projects  with   stringent  time  lines  and  budgetary  constraints  in  fast  paced  environment.  Solid  communication  skills  in  areas  of  public  speech  and  presentation.
good,"Loyalty to the company was pretty balanced. The job requirements were not complicated and the opportunity to transition became more available as the company grew. I felt that while I was there, the option to move and try new positions became more open. The compensation and market-based salary could always be revisited more often than it was."
good,"loved working with the people I did.  New company bought out ADT.  New company is a leveraged buyout firm, so they are now in the process of trimming the fat so to speak.  They are looking ot bust ythe union and use as many sub contractors as possible.  I enjoyued my time there but glad I gopt out when I did."
good,"A empresa tem uma boa estrutura, mas falta comprometimento com seus funcionários, pois éramos muito cobrados e quando precisávamos de suporte não tínhamos."
good,take calls from sales rep to see if any appointments were scheduled for them to go out and discuss putting in alarm systems in the customers home and that was for 8 hours
good,"some days the work load was to much to handle "
good,This was a temp job which was supposed to last 6 weeks but the task was completed in four weeks.  The workers seemed nice but not much interaction with them.
good,"I work for the old ADT when they were with Tyco, from 2007-2011, I left for better opportunity, I decide to return to the new ADT March 2018. After i was contacted by recruiter and i was offered more and something different from the monitoring center i previously I thought would be good to return back to my alma meta, training was good. One thing I notice they were under staff and to asked questions a for help was done all on chat which I didn't like I'm used someone coming to me looking at my screen and helping few times i was frustrated when i was on call with tech and needed help waiting for someone to respond or its not helping me at all when responding to my question, I remember first time taking calls some of those tech were rushing me in the call and sometime rude  i understand you have other jobs to go to but they not understand these are people life here we need to make sure everything is working right but it was low stressful some tech was cool. The reason i left ADT not understanding I have a life outside of work and for me I cannot work Saturday for religious reason, I provide a letter with proof from my church but they refusal to give me Saturday off, I understand your call volume on Saturday but most of Saturdays it wasn't even busy at all. I do not like the new ADT. The old ADT i work 7years ago work with me accommodate for me to make sure i have Saturday to worship the new ADT is business first we don't care about your outside life or religious belief these big companies always say these things for people to here but don't really mean it or care. They so under"
good,Must be self motivated and good at managing time. Variety of jobs available with this type of company and work. Some areas and cities are more lucrative than others.
good,"Learnt alot in all different departments. I was mainly in telemarketing, getting clients for appointments for new alarm systems. I also loaded all new applications when they came in. I also took queries about faulty alarm systems"
good,"Started in  Credit, Worked on National Accounts & Banks after acquisition, once cleared, larger portfolio was assigned, worked on EDI with customers, met to go over needs and wants to simplify invoicing issues. Learned about billing, Month End Analysis, Budget Forecasting, Audits. Promoted to Business Analyst Role, Worked on RFD / Tenders...Worked on Dashboards, Production & Commission, Supervised 1 year for Sales and Billing Manager on Leave."
good,"ADT is a company that is basically hundreds of local distributes. The public doesn't know this when they purchase, but your experience, whether using their security, or working for the company, completely depends on which distributor your work for."
good,I worked for this company more than a few years ago so much time has passed a and I cannot accurately review this company. Good luck with your future endeavors.
good,"Not many opportunities for advancements, most internal jobs were custom made for individuals."
good,Minimal training and high sales expectations.  Self-driven employees can excel with unlimited commission and bonuses.  Extensive travel required at the employees expense.
good,fast paced environment.  One must be good with changes.  Very nice people and staff.  It is an average Call Center environment with the pros and cons of a call center.
good,"Helping people can be a very rewarding job,  never boring,  somewhat stressful.  Advancement was very available,  didn't have to be there for years to advance"
good,es buena empresa comisiona bien pero el producto es sumamente dificil de vender
good,co workers were nice and willing to help as well as managers doing everything they can to make sure you are successful. going home to home knocking on the door to sell a alarm system can be hit or miss but if you are a great talker/salesman and are patience with customer there is a high chance of success
good,"outside sales for small business under 10000 sq ft.  Lead oriented, prospecting, cold calling, corporate appointments, upselling to existing clientele, sales quota, business to business, and much more."
good,"Typical day: set up computers, and calls from customers with security system issues.  I learned a lot about security systems and how to fix possible issues.  Management was good.  Workplace was very productive.  Hardest part of the job was the hours and some customers being frustrated with issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the projects and learning different parts of the job."
good,"Working at ADT you will be speaking to different customers regarding their home or business alarm. I learned how to assist customers with billing issues and initiate service calls. The management were okay, the workplace culture was very diverse, The hardest part of the jobs was getting customers to pay when they felt they didn't have to or whenever they wanted but the best part of the job was the perks and benefits."
good,"ADT is a great place to work with a family environment and very good benefits.  We have a positive culture. The hardest part of my job is that so many people basically fire themselves.  I can't help you keep your job if you don't show up to work.  I love the people I work with.  Just like any place there are challenges and ups and downs, the senior management can live in imagination land at times but all in all an awesome place to work."
good,Your success was determine on yourself motivation. The work atmosphere could be stressful at times due to the mere fact it was a job based on straight commission.
good,"Exciting place to work where although its a fast passed environment "
good,With the acquisition of ADT by Fidelity Group there were too many changes being implemented and changes to management which hindered progress. Changes that were not accommodated well with the staff resulting in many resignations. The pro's however are that the packages offered for upper levels of the organisation are well within if not over market related and personal growth which was ADT's focus has not yet come through with the new holding company.
good,"Many management changes and 100% commission without protected territories made it hard to succeed.  Often times i was competing against other reps for business in ""MY"" territory""."
good,"You learn a lot about the world of home security. It was not a stressful job.. just stressful as far as depending on a commission based salary. If there was base pay to go along with it, this would be the ideal career for me"
good,"It has been 20 plus year since I work at ADT, but I did enjoyed working for them. I really did not learn anything but how to better my self with customer services. I did not working up north in the winter months."
good,"Working at ADT is a very fast paste environment and to reach the goals, everyone must work at least 40 hours a week to be able to make a decent money. also not directions form the management."
good,ADT was a good company to work for and provided lots of growth and learning. Cons are the schedules and having to be put into a pool to get a decent schedule.
good,"Not really much to say about this place, it has its days and storms not really a people place to learn from seems like everyone was just to themselves"
good,"I didn't enjoy working here because of the compensation after the first six months of training. If a small business who purchased a security system failed or closed, the earned commission would be deducted from your next paycheck."
good,"The best part of my job, was helping people. So many times I was having to help people after the had a break-in, and that was difficult. But the other times helping people before a break-in was just as rewarding ."
good,"Spent the day cold calling customers, and also door knocking. I was on my time, so no set hours by the company. Management was good. Typical office culture."
good,"learned a lot of sales tactics, good training, lots of leads and company appts to self generate more business from, management was great, install techs were good"
good,Bonne ambiance générales. Plutôt bonne équipe de travail malgré la routine.
good,good place to work as long as you understand they are mainly concerned about the numbers. Maintain customer expectations and deliver quality service upon every appointment.
good,I am ready to join a team and work hard toward building a successful company. I enjoy challenges and always put 100% toward any task on hand. I look forward to be given a chance.
good,"The good things"
good,"The ADT Corporation is a leading provider of electronic security, interactive automation and related monitoring services for over seven million residences and small businesses in North America. ADT employs 16,000 people and generates over $3.5B in annual revenue. Acquired by Apollo Global Management and merged with Protection 1 in 2017. ADT offers many opportunities with good compensation and benefits. The people are engaging and friendly. Leadership is continuously changing but the culture is improving. Most of the focus is on the overall company success and not enough attention on internal and external customer experience. Sales associates have an opportunity to achieve a good income but most of their sales must come from self generated efforts. The sales program inclusive of the sales operations group and the sales enablement program need vast improvement. The Technical Operations side of the business is pretty sound but more time and attention needs to be on service to the existing customers rather that on new installations and gross adds."
good,"The company took away every sales rep's base salary while the CEO was using the company's funds to support his luxurious lifestyle. as a result, our department was dissolved."
good,"worked in different departments learn a lot they have lots of team work and team building. "
good,"driving to prospective client"
good,"good company, worked at your own pace.  you would go from house to house trying to provide security to residents and safety to their families.  most enjoyable would be working you own time"
good,They will train for the job so no experience is not a requirement. People are friendly. Team manager will work with your to achieve goals set by company.
good,"The location I worked at closed down, probably was one of the best jobs I ever had.  Never hated going into work, and worked with some fabulous people."
good,"Good Working Environment"
good,"ADT was a fun place to work for.  Working hours was flexable."
good,Not really a place I would recommend. Management was poor with no clear direction. People only concerned with getting over and making money. Quality of work was sub-standard
good,It is an alarm company. Very stressful. Not all calls though. Sometimes customers just wanted to test alarms. Learned a lot about security systems. The hardest part of my job was when an alarm was going off and I could not reach the customer. Did not what was going on until either customer or police called back. When everything was ok.
good,There are good people working for ADT but they were going through a transition be bought out by another company at the time and this changes what I was offered when I was hired.
good,"Overall, good place to work. Acquisitions and constant change in executive leadership was challenging. Good pay and promotional opportunities. Benefits were not up to a company of this size."
good,"Nice people to work with and nice environment. Flexible with your schedule however, lack of communication between departments. Overall, good place to work."
good,"ADT is a great opportunity, however I feel they focus more on their customers than their employees. They focus too much on our numbers. we do everybody job in the building."
good,"work place is not that bad, it just the management and the bonus that are not that great, they change every two weeks and it doesn't help you out. they fired the good ppl and let the ones messing around stay."
good,"Very demanding position, but rewarding. Responsible for demonstrating, designing and selling ADT Security solutions for small businesses. Heavy travel around Tri-State area required."
good,"•	Increased number of customers by 130% in 3 years"
good,I worked with this company as a door to door sales rep the job pays well for those who don't mind working all day and knocking doors but the job was very time consuming
good,I learned a lot regarding the office atmosphere of working with this company.  I would say this job is a great stepping stone into learning ethic and hard work.
good,"Must be a self starter, organized and extremely self motivated. "
good,A typical day at work was hectic. We often had to find seating for the day. You very rarely sat in the same area or space consistently weekly. I learned about a variety of alarm systems. I really enjoyed talking to an array of people daily.
good,Adt is a great place to start off in the world of call center. Provides great training for beginners as well as provides ample amount of time for employees to catch on.
good,"Not able to do commission type jobs, no steady income and I was not use to that, so I could not stay with the job. The people were great and did all they could to help me, not happy."
good,"good pay, management does not care to see its people succeed. Same tasks over and over everyday and some of the customers that call in can be a little strange. I overall enjoyed working here and if not for the management I would have stayed a lot longer."
good,My typical day at work is average. I learned to know more about the process of setting up the security system.  Management is average and workplace culture is average.  The hardest part of the job is I have to go travel up to 50 miles from where I live to meet clients. The most enjoy part of the job is meeting new people and help  them to have a better life style and make friends with them..
good,"manage current customer base look for new business , finding the person  to propose products to like being independent, love working with the public, co worker all help me when I ask for it"
good,"Not the worst job on earth, but not the best either. One thing I loved about the job is the Overtime opportunity."
good,"Nice entry level door to door marketing job. Typical day consisted of getting in a crew van and driving out to a residential location and hitting every house door to door promoting ADT's home security system, commission with every sell"
good,ADT is currently very fluid in changes due to the company being purchased by a management company.  The upper leadership can make things difficult for the middle management.
good,Good team attitude that everyone assists each other. Bad level of fairness from management. No progression. no training...............................
good,this job was ok if you like doing piece work and driving your own vehicle.  Pay was good at first but then the jobs stopped coming in.  Very badly managed and organized
good,A typical day at work I would describe it as a everyday learning process. I always go above as what  is expected of me at work. I enjoy working with all types of people's I get to learn how to handle each and every person on their  their own way. I have  learn that communication is the key to a better working place
good,Irving office has pretty slow internet. So often work flow is disrupted because of environment issues. Few servers used which causes constant changing of configuration.
good,"Consistency in calls, high call volume, family oriented, sometimes there were multiple calls in que but many employees were out. Management was very helpful"
good,This was a transitional position for me.  Nice people to work with and for but was not my preferred line of work.  Change in ownership of company after I left so I'm not sure what changes were implemented and impacted the culture and job itself.
good,"I had to so customer service, repairing the damaged equipment or installing. I managed my time, and had to get the work done by myself. It was my responsibility to get it well done. They had many benefits and it was in general a good company."
good,The position in existing sales was misleading in the details of pay structure and duties of the position. You find yourself dealing with negative experiences with the customers more than you do with actual sales opportunities.
good,"It was ok to work there I was only a Temp"
good,"If you are a self driven, relentless person who's prepared to do what ever it takes to get the sale, then this may be the right job for you. If not then I this company will not be the right fit for you. I wish that I had joined this company during the housing boom, because then I probably would have made a good living with this company. Unfortunately for me I joined at the time of the sub-prime mortgage collapse and because I was not able to hit my quotas I was let go, despite the fact that I had more than a 90% closing ratio when I was able to get an appointment to sell their alarm system."
good,ADT is a decent place to work.  The hourly pay isn't that great but the commission is worth it.  I would recommend this place to someone who needs employment.
good,"ADT is a good company, it has currently migrated with Protection one and undergone an integration of resources, systems and management. It has a new CEO and executive leadership.  Over all I feel the company's new structure and integration is good for the overall future growth of the company."
good,"very challenging. Goals were unreal, but the scope for promotion was very encouraging. Supervisors were very supportive and gave great advice"
good,"Good company to work for. Employees will help out training and getting you up to speed on companies programs, policies and procedures. Strong office personnel to rely on during difficult times."
good,great job and a good place to meet new people and to network for more clients all over the state and beyond. I would highly recommend for someone wanting a good job.
good,no se por que el sistema tomo como que el nombre de la optica tambien era adt ya que era visual net. Fuew mi primer trabajo y en donde me di cuenta que tenia la condicion de atender bien a las personas y sobre todo venderles. buena experiencia y exelente opoortunidad.
good,It is a pleasure working in this organization. Some really good benefits for the employee and excellent work life balance. Learnt a lot of things with respect to sales and other aspects of customer service.
good,ok company to work for.  not sales rep orientated anymore.  Lost 20K two years ina a row along with reps.  Not micromnaged as much any more.  sales reps are straight commission.
good,This is a good company to work for. Always know what you are getting into though. In Sales there is always ups and downs. You must be able to put many hours in and go hard everyday. My recommendation is to have your savings built up first.
good,Constant inbound and outbound calls to customers and technicians out in the field. Multi-tasking was one of the most important skills. Best part of the job was learning how to work for customers and manage technicians.
good,"It was interesting learning the particulars of a process from the back-end perspective of identifying and determining how to handle the various kinds of alarms that were optioned to ADT's clientele, commercial and personal."
good,Co-workers are excellent people.  Corporate has expectations that are impossible.  Bonuses were good when they offer them
good,Family Values and that really is important .  They had lots of outside activities for employees and families.  The hardest part of the job was discovering your on leads.
good,Responsible for taking phone calls on alarms in order to alert the customers to a possible problem. The hours were difficult. I don't feel at the time the center was mismanaged.
good,"productive place to work, nice friendly environment, have manager that is very supportive and is willing to go beyond to help the team players advance"
good,"The benefits were good and the commission structure was good before it was change the management wasn't too great Adt is quick to put people on the floor without good training good money but you get paid weekly and then your commission is every fourth week of the month I made great money the best year I brought in 72,000 it's people there that making 100,000 very easy job to learn but the most experience will come actually being on the phone and have some the season sales rep helping you"
good,"Senior Administrator looking after team of people working on Alarm specifications for National Accounts "
good,"My time at ADT was a learning experience as it was my first stable job, i started off in the bad debts department, which was rather tough, not very easy to collect monies especially when people are financially challenged. I did do my best, therefore was taken on in the contracts department, where i was appointed as a data capturer, which was interesting  alot of pressure, attention to detail. Learnt alot with regards to alarm systems didn't  types of stock and safety. Management was good did not have any issues. It was a month to month contract. Was grateful to  have been given that opportunities."
good,"the turn over rate is very high, the pay was decent , they do give out incentives, but a good place to work if you are looking for growth .. policies and procedures change way to much"
good,This company in irving texas was a good company to work for. They did not have any company incentives but they did have a relaxed environment and you can dress how you like.
good,"This company changes things almost monthly.  I made great money my first year, but then they changed everything up on me and I had to restart again.  They tell you your going to get all these appointments, and yet you get 1 - 2 a month.    Really sad that they are focusing on phone sales."
good,"1.) A typical day with ADT starts with pulling up my daily sales report. After reviewing all the information I am ready to check all email updates from Admin, Customers, Installation, Management etc. After all of this is finished I will begin prospecting. If I have no customer appointments set for the day already. Hitting the phones, visiting Referral partners and Community Leaders in order to increase visibility, new clients and referral partnerships. "
good,"Working for ADT gave me a lot of experience working with customers. However, they do not offer a lot of time to meet with family or plan events for weekends."
good,"It was a good working environment, we had a good team and team spirit. Salary was low and little opportunity for career advancement. "
good,"My experience at ADT Security was overall good. Made over my quota each month, help from teammates and manager, and a lot of room for learning."
good,I did not work for ADT full time. I was a contractor through an agency and really cant rate this company accurately. I do not know enough about their benefits or overall employee moral.
good,"This job is a good opportunity for entry level applicants to learn about customer service. Personally for me, I am the type of person where I need face to face interaction instead of staring at a computer in a cube all day long. You are in a team, but the only time I get to interact with my team mates is during a meeting once every two weeks."
good,"Most environments were call centers.  Everything is timed down to the second.   Amerisuites Hotel was the exception where I worked at the front desk, and drove a shuttle to and from DFW Airport."
good,"My objective is to provide customer service assisting customers with their billing, making payments, updating credit card info, research information, adjusting address changes, up selling customers and transfer to the correct department if need be."
good,"We were sent to Florida for training.  I made some close friends while working there.  The job included making phone calls, door knocking and going on company set appointments.  Making phone calls was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is both an inside and outside sales job."
good,So many things to learn and opportunities to sharpen one's skills. ADT is reputable and as such prides itself in helping its customers and even more its employees so you have peace of mind working for them.
good,"Can be stressful at times, especially during environmental crisis, or any mass destruction event. Having said that, one does get a good feeling when they have done what was needed and helped the client or the emergency services. In those moments, the stress is worth the end result."
good,It is a good work environment as long as you are willing to carry your own weight at work.  They do care about the employees and try to make the enviornment as positive as possible for those that work there.
good,"o	Alert customers and law enforcement of ADT Security systems triggered through out the U.S."
good,Enjoyed training young folks and watching them become successful - Upper management less than wonderful.  Direct supervisor was more interested in his own advancement than in helping others succeed.
good,"Go through emails, morning meeting, call suppliers for follow up with stock. go out see clients identify new clients. Do site follow up with sub contractors."
good,Data General was acquired by EMC several years ago - Was a dynamic place to work. Struggled in the last several years prior to being acquired
good,"very demanding position as most sales and sales management positions are."
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff , had a good relationship with everyone. day to day capturing contracts/data, assisting in accounts and doing recruiting"
good,"Typical day includes logging on to the phones and computers, taking calls and taking your breaks. You help customers turn off alarms and solve their technical issues."
good,"I learn to understand the needs of costumer. I made some technical presentation of safety system (smoke, video, monoxide). I use Oracle Salesforce and Gryphon tools."
good,in a busy environment learnt that hardwork and team work are keys to success and to collaborate accross boundaries would love to get into management one day
good,Great company to work for. Everybody is really down to earth. Getting to speak with new people everyday is the best part.
good,"I promoted honesty as the foundation of the organization with an obligation to uphold the highest standards of superiority. "
good,"Grato ambiente laboral."
good,"Productive and Challenging"
good,this was an good place to work as well but I had things going on that prevented me from still being with the company. I was able to switch positions within months without any problems
good,I worked with a group mainly of men. I felt a out of place and uncomfortable at times. I learned to communicate with potential customers who were interested in having a security system installed into their homes. My supervisor had access to equipment that would guide us were we needed to go. My co-workers were enjoyable to work with until the line of comfortably of opposite . I never had to encounter so many different kinds of people to communicate with. I enjoyed the different areas around Washington.
good,"Door to door sales is what it is. I enjoyed it due to the fact I got to actually meet a new person every knock. Plus you get to see how people set up their houses, and it always surprises you. Lots of hours, but lots of interesting days. If you keep your chin up, there is TONS of money to be made."
good,"rewarding; pro-active assistance of others to live mor secured, peaceful lives while passively fighting crime. Also safeguarding lives from critical conditions such as fire, carbon monoxide, flood and low temperature issues in home"
good,"ADT as a whole is a great company, with multiple locations and opportunities to grow. The hardest part of my job was the lack of morale and the constant hard work as a lower level manager to keep the morale up in my department, when all morale impacting decisions were made by senior managers. Morale is very important to me, it dictates the type of work quality you will receive from your direct and indirect reports."
good,"good people, so-so managers, , intense people too"
good,"like the new working environment and really like the coworkers when i was there, i loved the pay every  week and the bonuses and games that you play to win prizes and the compensation was better than last job and it was a monday through friday job"
good,"Overall good company, but the position I held just wasn't for me.  I am used to an office setting and this was setup more as a call centre."
good,good company to work for. great people and good environment. Lots of opportunity to grow. lots of opportunity to grow. Overall fun place to work.
good,management was decent and the job was stimulating kept you keep busy with the reports that needed to be completed by a certain date and time
good,"Let's say this job is not for everyone. You don't have fixed hours, so you got to work ""on your own"", and you have to sell in order to be paid sufficiently. The hardest part about the job is to make cold calls and go door-to-door with the purpose of signing new clients. Other than that, it is very nice to meet new people almost everyday and make their life a little less stressful by securing their homes and businesses."
good,I've learned much of my industry at this company and have much respect for them. I've enjoyed much of the opportunities awarded to me while I was there.
good,ADT isn't a bad place to work. I enjoyed my time working there. It was a great place to gain customer service experience. I learned how to deal with a variety of different customers.
good,"I can say its number one security company in South Africa I have a learn a lot as a sales consultant with them, and I have gained lots of sales skills."
good,The pay for ADT was good but the leadership team didn't do a good job in allowing their staff to lead.   If they hired someone in a team lead role they don't really want them to act as a supervisor they want them to work as if they are a regular team player.  So in a nut shell they give you the title but not the power and responsibility behind it.
good,"plenty of work available,50 to 60 per week.professional employees,good management.4 to 6 hrs of driving, per day.use computer set up job,test job,close job &collect payment.check inventory daily.turn in paperwork daily."
good,ADT was a place with great benefits and great hours but the people there weren't too pleasant. But if I could go back and make better decisions I would.
good,Everyday was all ways different . the customers  were the best part of the job .Co worker would always help each other so we all can go home for the day .
good,"All of what was mentioned above. A very good industry to work in. Must be willing to drive all day, weird schedule, 12-930/10pm. No life really outside of work. Money and opportunity is there if that's ALL you want out of life. Basically cold knocking new home owners."
good,"I have experienced most probably the best and not so good leadership interaction. I was given the opportunity to pursue personal development/direction."
good,"Had a wide range of equipment and devices and sometime too much to keep track of and not enough room to carry it all, so they  know about a device we carry but you don't have one and then you have to go back later to install it can be a pain"
good,The  best part I liked about ADT was helping the residential older residential customer to shown them how to use something new call me very challenging but rewarding when they finally get it.
good,"installation of alarm systems"
good,"a typical day of work at adt security services for me starts by me coming in and finding a work space to log in at. after logging in and checking my schedule for the day I begin to dispatch on alarms. when receiving alarms the job can be very repetitive and I become easily bored when doing the same thing over and over. the time tends to drag and it becomes very lifeless. but you have to stay content with customers and make sure you do your best to help them. working late hours into the day can become very tiring when you have to sit for a very long time. working at adt can be a good place to grow and build experience but me, I prefer more life, more interaction, and more activity when working on a job"
good,Co-workers where nice. Didn't really like to be on the phone consistently for a long period of time. Management was good made sure we were taken care of.
good,"Tyco/ADT outside sales.  Cold calling, mailers, door hangers, geographic canvassing, email blasts, referrals.  Met home owners and designed home security systems to protect them and there property."
good,"It was a good company to work and earn to sell for . For a 22 year old it was great to be getting paid the money i was . You got vacation time , the upper management dont like the sales reps they believe we were numbers .all and all it was not the worst place to work ."
good,I moved back home from Texas had family emergency I've enjoy the job there is 4 weeks training in Florida Had my own territory to sell security systems to residential customers
good,Long Hours and working all around the clock. Mostly in the evening and the weekends to fit your customers schedule. Can be very successful if you are a flexible worker.
good,"100% commission, no room for advancement. little to no training."
good,"Good Company to work for. The job is very stressful for obvious reasons when dealing with fire and burglaries, but is balanced by the company culture."
good,"I start my day by reviewing the timecards for all installers and reviewing the installation schedule. I spend my day reviewing the schedule, moving calls, identifying and solving customer issues. I make welcome calls, I confirm installations for the next day and review & process payroll. I work with many people who have been with the company for many years, managers and admin staff. I enjoy the people I work with and am happy with the location of the office but the hardest part of my job is solving problems with limited resources."
good,When employed at the adp you will experience a friendly and social environment from the fellow staff. The administration staff seems disjointed an distant from the hands on teaching environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the consumers.
good,For a business that has been in business for over 140 years this company is incredibly scattered. There are some great management but others that have become too comfortable in their position and don't seem to show compassion toward their employees.
good,Un trabajo con pocas posbilidades de progreso en respecto de mis espectativas pero con un agradable ambiente de trabajo
good,the company is great while i was there. i have been a way for nearly five years and dod not have a current update the status of the company.
good,fun place to work with great people and wonderful management opportunities also great tools are provided for helping you to succeed
good,ADT is a well known company and strived to provide excellent customer service. Working as a sales rep it is definitely competitive and challenging but when it was great it was great and when it was bad it was bad. There is not base pay commission only.
good,"Management is in NS which makes things hard at times on a daily basis.  Need a local branch manager to oversee the daily admin., etc in local branch"
good,"The job is forever changing."
good,This position required the tech to make key decisions daily on the installation in a customers home or a commercial install. I rely on my ability to make strong decisions that benefits the customer as well as the company.
good,"Great team and staff, amazing management, many opportunities, you have to bust your a&% in the field to make money...keep on knocking on doors, eventually one will say yes!!"
good,"Great established company, higher management doesn't have the positive, action based motivation form of business. No life in the office, just there for the paycheck."
good,I enjoyed the experience I learned how to be successful in sales and learned many skills to apply to any position. very easy job
good,"At this employer I learned how to fine tune my customer service skills where we were graded on world class customer service, and also one call resolution."
good,"To crack it in this industry you have to posses people skills."
good,"door to door sales , also learned how to recruit and build a team "
good,"I loved the busy environment but this was one of those jobs you could never catch up. I had so much on my plate, I would go in early and stay late and never get caught up."
good,Work hard and it will pay off. Support is there if you know how to get it.
good,"Outside sales, resell to existing customer base who have ended there contact, or has had difficulties' with various aspects of the program"
good,"Day consisted of handling 150 emergency dispatch calls, easy to make mistakes and be penalized."
good,You have to be very individually motivated to make the money here and move to the next level!  Great fit if you don't have young children!
good,"The morning starts at 6:45 a.m., we receive our equipment for the day along with all our paper work. Sometime we ride to our installs with an associate to get more training. The hardest part of the job would have to be the time spent alone driving to a house 2 hours away. I do like the independence from some manager on top of you. Co workers are great, sort of like a small family."
good,This is a good company with great pay and advancement. I had a break in working for the company for a few months because I went out of country but came back and got in due to a great unit manager who is with the company.
good,"very fun fast pace place to work, stressful at times"
good,I loved the people that I worked with. The training was intense but great and a lot of fun. The training that you are taught you really get a great hold of the position you are going to be performing
good,"A typical work day was to prospect and close businesses. I learned to  always be very activated in prospecting, and my management believe in assisting me.  My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was I spent to much with the client trying to qualify them for the service. The most enjoyable part of the job was the income."
good,A day is having to trouble shoot problems with customer system. What i am learning is  finding out different system issues and how to fix the  problem for them.  Management are nice to work for.  The co work are  a great bunch of people.  The hardest part is when you can not help with fixing the system for the  customer.  The most enjoyable is fixing the problem with out having to send a tech out to the customers home.
good,This company is a reasonable employer.  Its workplace was acceptable and the workload was constant.
good,"Very fast paced, many responsibilites, and never doing the same thing. The job is enjoyable because I am trusted and allowed to manage myself, however it is very stressful because the amount of work that I complete is for multiple positions."
good,"Independent working environment."
good,hardest part of the job is actually getting customers to sign up.
good,"Organização de tarefas bem definidas e controladas. Fazia a tarefa de abertura da empresa como abrir estores electricos, ligar equipamentos e rever todos os consumivéis em falta ou a acabar, Listar os mesmos e entregar ao patrão. Este conferia e fazia confirmação de listagem se estava certa. Fazia apoio logistico."
good,"I learned a lot about professional development and how important it is to always be growing in my job role.  It was important in this job to train up new leaders and to empower others to do their job well.  The leadership training and professional development opportunities that I received helped me to be a better supervisor, leader, and motivator in my career overall."
good,"Un ambiente demasiado cálido a pesar de los insultos de las personas al tratar de realizar ventas. Con el tema de l liquidación el resultado es pésimo. No cumplían con las fechas acordadas, etc-."
good,"My daily responsibilities include coordinating the daily activities of 40 technicians. I am also responsible for purchasing parts, shipping, monthly inventory, doing transfers, running specialized reports, and daily updating in Master Mind, Excel, & MS Office."
good,"Day consist of visiting clients, discussing their home and or business security needs. "
good,My co-workers and immediate supervisor made this job an enjoyable experience. The hours and policies made this job difficult.
good,The people I worked with at ADT were wonderful!  I really enjoyed the time I spent there.
good,"My typical day consisted of cold calling on large corporations.  I discovered a database full of larger clients tucked away by their corporate division and should have been national accounts."
good,working overnight was a little hard at first but it gets easier by the weeks. I learned a  lot about alarms and the hardest part was staying awake. The enjoyable part was It was nice and calm at night. The management was ok for the most part.
good,Branch manager was a complete idiot. A lot of what he was trying to do was for personal gain and he didn't foster a positive work environment. Installers couldn't talk to the administration personal. He created a divide and made it a difficult place to get work done. My immediate supervisor was amazing and the majority of the other installers were great to work with. Pay is horrible starting out unless you have your low voltage license (State trying to make money).
good,"Duties and responsibilities are to initiate necessary action when irregular signals are received or trouble develops. Responsible for working with outside repair technicians, guards, etc, to ensure that signals are received properly also that circuits and signaling devices are restored to normal operations. Also responsible for notifying appropriate authorities and customers if alarm signal is received while adhering to standard operating procedures and special instructions, interpret and record signals received from customer's premises as needed. Respond quickly and precisely to incoming phone calls Document all alarm activity and subscriber phone calls via PC and activity reports. Assist customers via telephone with technical alarm questions Contact customer via telephone to inquire about unusual events with the customer's alarm system (not closing or opening on time)"
good,"generally great company; tons of in depth training and salary is great if you want to work 6 10-12 hour days a week EACH week.  "
good,"After the split from Tyco and the merge with Broadview, ADT has lost their identity.  Instead of being a leader in the industry, they have become a follower.  Always trying to catch up their technology with others in the industry, instead of being the example and leading the way."
good,2-3 installs per day.  Some days they are on opposite sides of the territory.
good,"Company has thrown many changes giving opportunity to learn and obtain experience. The people I work with are amazing, and have helped me grow and learn in areas that I was missing."
good,"Great part of my position- Helping customers protect their home and family."
good,policies are not employee friendly. management is very friendly and environment is very welcoming but as mentioned employees are second to all else
good,"I love what i do at work. Helping customers on a daily basis comes natural to me. Being around others and working as a team is something i enjoy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to  assist customers and show my personality. I have learned my interest is more towards Management or Team Lead. The hardest part of my job is when a customer is unhappy about a situation that i can not resolve, I always try my best to give the customer all that they need.  Every customer is different and I've learned how to handle each call with a professional attitude plus tone to help the customer."
good,On a typical day I receive inbound calls from customers and from service technicians in the field.
good,Typical Day includes answering calls and assisting customers managers are there to help
good,"I enjoyed working for this company , it was a very great leaning experience ...."
good,"Productive working enviroment, managment very approciable and plesant co-workers"
good,We visit with and consult with clients face to face about their security and life safety needs. We analyze their home to identify what products work for them and we recommend the best packages to fit their needs and provide them the safety they deserve
good,Training could be better. Management is amazing but higher up is tough!
good,"A typical day included processing multiple invoices and expense reports."
good,"Working for ADT requires short to long distance travel (work vehicle provided), patience (long drives or difficult customers), and knowledge of a variety of hand tools for the installation of devices. Work environment varies from small business to residential houses; customer relations will vary from customer to customer: some will be grateful for your services and others will be frustrated new or existing customers who have had issues with pre installed devices."
good,Very busy call center. They like to reward employees that do their job. Always have overtime available.
good,Working outside sales selling security systems. Generating leads is the expectation and keeping a 50% closing rate.
good,"• Continued developing interpersonal skills while generating business through in-home sales visits, cold calls, and networking."
good,Commission only sales is a hard job. I have learned a lot from the company and coworkers with many years of experience.
good,"very productive place to work, very busy, management  was strict but organized"
good,"As a whole, my current workplace is a fairly balanced company. In the department that I currently work for there are a number of very intelligent and hard working employees that contribute to a pleasant atmosphere and a strong work ethic. There are also, unfortunately, some examples of poor management that exercise the ""few bad apples"" dynamic to a breaking point. Those fortunate enough to not be directly affected by these singular sources of discord and counter productive management styles are likely to be content with the environment offered. In my time there I have learned a great deal about a myriad of accounts receivable processes in particular, and time management/problem solving in general. I've enjoyed working together with my peers to find ways to help improve how our business operates and regret that the presence of a few bad seeds in upper management are steering an otherwise positive work experience into a negative one."
good,ADT within the Life Safety Systems Critical Application Support arena is a very intensive job.
good,"working to many hrs,but i enjoy what i do,helping other techs in their installs"
good,"I enjoyed learning everything I did to be able to do my job. Worst part was trying to keep calls low so that it didn't mess up productivity. However, you don't want to rush the customer off of the phone you want to make sure the call is answering all of their issues. Most enjoyable part was being able to shorten the training and guideline book down to become smaller for me to access it easily."
good,Had to manage 40 employees and report to operational manager in pe
good,"Most enjoyable---Work schedule is somewhat flexible"
good,This job is ok. Management is fair and understanding. Expect back to back calls which is fine by me
good,"Okay place to work for entry level candidates job is simple, face paced, and busy."
good,It's a very long day talking to different people from all across the states. The co-workers are like one big family. The most enjoyable part of my job are the coworkers
good,"Would get our jobs in the morning from what the sales person sold a week/month ago. You did not know what time of enviornment you were going to be walking into unless it was written down in the paper, hopefully. Compensation was good though if you got the job done quickly or if there were any add ons is where you made some good money. Did not like being covered in blown insulation, some jobs could be done in a day and some would take two. You would not get paid for any of the work until the job was completed. You would also go out of town on occation. Company Vehicle was a big plus and complany gas card. All equipment provided except drills ect."
good,"Very good company to work for, but no further growth opportunities for promotions."
good,nice professional environment co workers management are great nice place just no for me no flexibility
good,"Territory was very large and not protected at all. "
good,"Het werk was zeer werk zeer gevarieerd, met zeer fijne collega´s. De mogelijk was daar op parttime te werken."
good,"Get to work at 8:00 am chekc the phones to see if any customers has issue and get to right department. Check log of sales associate to see if they still have not got money on jobs that were already done and collect money. Add new job in log. Do payroll for tech workers only. I also did booking of jobs for the tech to go out and do for the sales associates. Loved my co-worker she is a great person to work with. The hard part of the job was working a temp for a year, getting hire full time, and then the cut backs."
good,"No two days are the same."
good,At this particular job the were to many man managers telling you different things to deal with the customers with effected sometimes in bad customer service. Overall ok job but working in a call center wasnt for me.
good,"being able to help callers with setting up their alarm systems when there was trouble,  Being able to help customers by notifying them if the was alarm coming from their system"
good,Phones mainly.. management was disorganized. Coworkers were very friendly and pleasant for the most part. Hardest part was not knowing exactly what was expected. Most enjoyable were my co-workers.
good,"Help provide electronic security, by monitoring commercial, residences and small business"
good,"I clock in on my computer and load up my programs. I log into the phone and start taking calls. The calls I receive come from sales representatives who call in after making a sale with a customer. I take the information from their signed contract and input it into the systems. I learned how to use my time efficiently and how to keep my emotions in check when I was on the phone. The phone calls can range from easy to really hard when it comes to the different personalities of each rep. I have become really with keeping a level head and just try to help the rep as best as I can. My immediate manager is a good guy and great at his job. He is really good to the people who work under him and is always willing to help. The general managers are good people too. They know their company and treat their employees well too. All my co-workers are really good at their job and most enjoy it very much. They work with each other and are never not willing to help another coworker who may be new. The hardest part of the job is the fact that it is a call center. The one job I really never wanted to do but right out of college I needed a job and it was the first one to hire me after looking for months. The calls can be okay most of the time, but the one call with an angry rep can take a bit of getting used to. The best part of the job is having one in the first place. I can complain a lot of the time but the benefits and having complete control of my paid time off is worth the challenge and stress that come with the job."
good,I go to work everyday and take phone calls and coordinate technicians to their job sites.
good,"I work at home alone on a computer phone.I get commissions from Adt security.it is very ,very fun"
good,Sit at the desk all day and eat and make outbound calls to customers. I learned that I would not want to get an alarm system in my house unless it was purchased at Radio Shack.
good,there was not a challenge to the job you were just a apt checker. an insult to your integrity
good,A typical day consists of cold calls and pursuing new businesses that have opened in the NYC tristate area.
good,Will watch alarm and attempt to call the customer of the alert and contact the authorities for assistance
good,started from knowing nothing and became a good installer.opened the door for so many oppertunitys
good,This Job is all about numbers if you can makes sales via phone keep up with stats this is the job for you
good,"ADT is a good company to work for, room to grow, it gets stressful sometimes but its worth it when able to fix customer issues"
good,I interact with clients in their home on a daily basis. I have really enjoyed the outside sales experience. The most difficult part of the job is the after the sales process including installation of product. The best part is the lucrative commission and relationship building.
good,"A typical work day included coming in and making sure all necessary applications where working and available on the PC. Next, make sure I was logged in and adhered to my schedule for that day. Then, assisting customers in the most timely and efficient way possible making sure every issue resolved. I learned many new trouble shooting skills dealing with alarm system and also the procedures taking when a customer alarms signal is recieved at ADT. My co-workers were very helpful and knowlegeable of the information needed to succeed. I would not say anything about this job was hard or challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I may have prevented someones house or residence from being vandalized by making sure immediate contact with the authorities was made so they could assist."
good,"Come in sit at your desk log into your computer and phones and take and make calls all day non-stop until your breaks."
good,I was data entry for a special project. We were taking inbound calls from installers and implementing zones and dispatch information. I also had to perform off phone duties to correct mistakes. I learned how important it was to be accurate because in this situation our customers lives were at stake. I also learned what it means to have a peace of mind within your own home.
good,special operations coordinator have to insure techs are getting to high priority calls with in small time frame. Requires a lot of follow up. 
good,"Supervised Inbound/outbound calls dealing with customer service, technical support and billing questions. Responsible for collecting past due amounts. Stayed current with company policies and procedures as well as new products information. Monitored and recorded personal reliability objectives daily and monthly. "
good,I answered a lot of calls from security system customers helping with silencing their alarms or setting up technician appointments.
good,"leadership great"
good,"Since ADT separated from Tyco in 2012, the company has had to reinvent itself, and has done Ok with the staffing and technology piece, but the culture is fairly toxic."
good,"Typical day was pulling out a phone book and making cold calls.  Set appointments and updating customer relations database.  Building estimates and closing sales.  Co workers were friendly and knowledgeable, but would often require splitting sales with the reps if they assisted at all with the proposal."
good,ADT LLC is a decent working environment with plenty of opportunities.
good,"It is a good company, but hard to sell security systems in this economy. It was 100% commission. "
good,"It is a good place to work, the only situation is having to wait on another team member if they are late, you have to stay until they cover your shift.  As an Assistant Manager you are required to do all duties, but the Manager gets the larger bonus, but if the Manager has no employees they will have to work the whole store"
good,My job is to help fix what is wrong and to ensure our customers are satisfied with the resolution of their problems. The job requires constant communication and cooperation from a variety of departments. My investigative skills and problem solving skills have definitely improved.
good,"Productive workplace , Prizes , and Gift Cards and Spin the Wheel and win Trips"
good,Productive
good,Typical day consisted of going on appointments and evaluating customers security needs. I learned some interesting facts about home invasions. The management was supportive but not very understanding. Going on appointments that weren't planned very well. I loved being able to help anyone that needs security services.
good,"Onsite report is to be completed by 0900. Calling technicians for the estimated time of arrival for their next jobs, open work orders and to schedule to complete installations previously started."
good,"This is a great place to work, they have good morals and people who work for them. they also have a great customer based support system."
good,A typical day at work would be interacting with customers to find out what their expectations of an alarm system would be.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of continuously staying on top of all the sales associates to make sure that they were hitting their target areas and following up on the leads provided to them. The sales training was pretty impressive, and the co-workers were a mixture of lazy vs ambitious. The hardest part of the job was the micro management of the sales associates that were there just to try an make a few dollars. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a new employee develop and watching them grow into a position where they not only started to make good money, but also began to better themselves."
good,"great enviroment, nice people. i enjoyed meeting new people, i learned so much"
good,Upon arrival at work we get paper work ready.
good,"I made cold calls to start the day, which was over an hour. I planned out where I wanted to meet with potential customers for security system. The most difficult part of the job was meeting with people more than once about getting a security system and they still won't buy one, or choose a competitor. ADT was not the cheapest and there is no chance of ever being the cheapest."
good,"ADT is a well known company all the way around, they have been servicing communities around the world for quite some time, as many companies the bigger the company the more the focus lessons on the thoughts and feelings of the employees of the company. Great place to brush up on customer service skills and if call center work is for you a great place to start a career, advancement can be quick and the pay can increase. Over all a ok company to look for and a good stepping stone for what I am looking for in a future career."
good,Good company to work for. Everyday you are helping field technicians in making sure the programming of the panel systems are correct. I have learned a lot in reguards of the systems.
good,"invalueable place to work,some good co-workers and good pay."
good,"Efetuava a instalação de sistemas eletrônicos de segurança, através da qual enriqueci meus conhecimentos e habilidades."
good,i would recieve the signal and if it was needed to call poilice i would if i couldnt get ahold of any of the customers on the call log
good,Very fast paced position. Calls were constantly in queue with irate customers due to billing or technical problems. My co-workers were nice to work with. We enjoyed our breaks and team meetings to regroup.
good,Everybody is has the chance for more oppurtunities. Management is very unknowledgeable.
good,"Cold calling, door knocking, building referral relationships."
good,Handling inbound calls and making daily outbound calls to arrange pre-set appointments for Sales Representatives
good,I enjoyed my time with ADT very much and I enjoyed the people I worked with as well.
good,"My overall experience with Dell/ADT is an enjoyable one. I have not overall compliants, I was able to become Lead Tech in about 6 months, so they do recongize talent. I am dual trained so I can work with a team from 6 members to 2 members. I worked in the Mobility department and Deskside support. The most enjoyable part to my job is the interaction with the clients. The hardest part is overcoming some of the scheduling challenges."
good,Lots of incentives and very challenging. BIG money opportunities if you do well
good,taking calls from customers usually because they are having problems with their alarm system. try to solve problem over the phone or book engineer to go to site.
good,Enjoyed working there
good,Overall Tenable was a good place to work. But there is so much favortism and unfair treatment that was not completely visible.
good,I worked in the billing department. This is a big organization as we were taking calls from all over US and Canada. The way you are graded on job performance left little to desire for the customer. I felt sorry for the customers as we were pushed to get the call handled in so many minutes and get off the phone and on to the next customer. There were a lot of infuriated customers that I spoke with.
good,A great place to work for the highly self motivated sales representative.
good,"You have to be very agressive with this job, sometimes they hire to many sales reps and you also have to compete with vendors."
good,"At ADT I enjoyed my time there, altough I was faced with multiple attidues from complaining customers I always kept a professional tone and attitude as well as handling each and every call in a respectable manner."
good,Lots of flexibility with your schedule
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering multiple phone calls and assisting customers. I have learned patience is a must when working in customer service. Most of the people that call into the center are upset with the company in some regards, and they always take their frustrations out on the reps. However, it is our job to correct the problem and ensure that it will not happen again. The easiest part of my job is when customers call in to make payments, or when I am coaching someone else on how to handle phone calls and other situations. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to help my peers with their customer's issues and concerns!"
good,I worked for this company for over 15 years. I enjoyed the corporation.
good,My typical day starts off by calling in checking my voicemail for appointments. I learned so much for as home security set ups. Where the contacts should go on windows and doors. My manager was great as a person and trainer. I say the hardest part of the job was driving 3 hrs away for a accessory order such as a motion sensor. The greatest part of my job was to meeting wonderful people each day.
good,ADT is the leading home security company and for good reason. They have a very extensive training program and offer a lot of knowledge to its employees.
good,"Typical day to day was canvassing/calling for leads to in home consultations usually leading to first call closes."
good,"You get to work on your own out in the field and not in a cubicle , not a bad place to work , but hard to advance as a career , management are friendly and help and so are other techs in the field."
good,Great workplace with time/life balance. My lifestlye changed and i had twins and had to adjust mentally or else would still be apart of organization. Designed for the entreprenuer at heart with great commissionable earning potential.
good,Wasn’t  bad working at this company until a new manager came in and messed everything up . Good place to work at but not with the new management . Feel free filling up for this job
good,"Pros: Good place to start working in Alarm and cameras. They have online guides to learn programming. Paid upsales. Fairy good health insurance. "
good,"The training and job itself along with benefits was great. The work culture is hard to grow within because of the lack of integrity with management, HR, and most of the leadership in the company. There are many individuals employed there who are physically violent and lazy with zero work ethic and ambition who remained employed while many hard-working individuals are terminated with invalid reasoning. I would recommend this place if you are desperate for a job, but if you have other options, seek those first!"
good,"I worked for the Mt. Laurel branch of ADT for almost seven years and for most of those years, it was a stressful job. Like any business that has work loads based upon customer purchase(buying a new system, sales etc), your position hopefully wasn't ""nixed"" if work got slow. Thankfully, I kept my head down, did my work, and was ultimately promoted from within. "
good,Work performance is based on company matrix system which is done via voice recognition system. Agent accountability difficult to control due to voice recognition system that can not tell difference between agents and customers
good,all commission sales...they will starve you if you cant sell. you probably wont make it. good luck. the hours are fairly flexible but you better be prepared to work nights and Saturdays!
good,Management didn't have much experience in her position. no help but good benefit. few leads to work and door nacking it was a nightmare part of jobs. your own company will be your competitor.
good,"There is always change in the metrics that need to be meet. The job can be difficult if you're not good at adjusting to constant change. It's all about the numbers and more numbers. Employees tend to be last on the priority list, which is why the turn over rate is high. Always say what you need and stick with it."
good,This company could be great except they expect techs to be everything for the company.  They compare you to other branches and other companies too often and don't take into consideration the full details.
good,"Llamar clientes, escucharlos, atenderlos, tratar de solucionar todos los malos entendidos."
good,"Every day was never the same, which made it enjoyable and a fun place to work. I started at ADT when i was 18 years old and within my time there I have learned so many new skills and built up my technical knowledge of fire and security products within my 14 year period as an employee. i also grew as a person with my time at ADT and grew in confidence thanks to the support of my fellow co-workers."
good,Overall I would say ADT is a okay place to work. Typical day at work is medium call volume learn a lot from the different systems and troubleshooting with customers.The most enjoyable part if talking and working with different customers from all over and co-workers.
good,"There was place to advance"
good,Helps you get experience in call centers. A lot of room for opportunity and advancement. I recommend if you are trying to get your foot in the door and get more experience.
good,"Worked here for two years, I wouldn't say it's a job of longevity. Work is easy and repetitive. Can get busy/boring at times otherwise its a good place to work for college students"
good,"Installed and repaired alarms, CCTV and access control. Did monthly reviews of performance. Monthly meetings to discuss productivity and field issues.  Monthly vehicle inspections as well as safety equipment.  High stress work environment with high demand to stay productive and meet sales goals as an installer or service tech.  Good compensation for meeting goals but not so much for not achieving them."
good,"Very productive environment , People work hard and very professional but poor salary for what employee give. "
good,"Main person front of desk when clients arrive, post incoming and outgoing, main switchboard took telephone messages, raising invoices for clients, team meetings attending and arranging. Culture was fun, long hours some days, social side was good. Everyone was part of a team - just a small team about 20 of us. I liked meeting different people coming into reception. I learned a lot using the telephone and being first point of contact gives you confidence."
good,"ADT is a great company for individuals looking to being their sales career, but it does not offer much hope for long term growth.  After a merger with a leading competitor, the training and support has gone downhill significantly.  The fact that the majority of the executives are only with the company for a few years at a time says a lot."
good,"ADT is a good company, but when I worked there, residential sales were paid commission.  Not reliable enough with a young family.  I needed a more stable position."
good,"The Job is very stressful and can get to you but the benefits are pretty great lots of paid vacation time, the co-workers make it worth it all though."
good,"Any type of 100% commission job takes a high level of drive to get out and sell. The biggest issue I had with the company is they restructured the compensation plan 3x within a year and half and running the sales I made under the most recent formula resulted in a $30,000 reduction in pay. Not to mention that if you do have success they will immediately cut your area in 1/3 or more by adding a bunch of other sales reps in that location. It is very cutthroat, our office had about an 85% turnover rate within 3 years."
good,"Sink or swim culture. Insensitive environment. One year salary plus commision. They constantly change commision grid to suit Company.  "
good,"I started with ADT in the beginning of the year, at that time I had a GREAT manager who personally took the time to properly train reps. Later in year, that manager actually resigned. ADT has a constant revolving door when it comes to the retention rate of employees. "
good,Fast paced call center job with limited opportunity for advancement. High volume work with great attention to detail required for all work preformed.  Would recommend job to others wanting to work in a call center environment.
good,Management at ADT is Amazing. The Managers personally want to see you succeed in whatever life path you are making or wanting to pursue for yourself. I learned a great deal of patience while being in a stressful situations. This job is a mental job and can take its toll on you mentally. Lucky they offer services to help with these situations to help ease you so you can go about your day and not have to worry about the little old lady life you saved when someone was breaking into her home the night before. They work on team building here with activities and contest that make coming to work fun and enjoyable.
good,First off I did enjoy this job as a Dispatcher then they pushed me to move up to CSG. I absolutely HATED CSG. The stress behind it wasn't terrible but compared to dispatching it was rough. The management here is a whole other story. They LOVE to pick favorites and guess what if you aren't in their favorites good luck moving up past ARC. Not all managers act like that but most there will. On top of  it all half of the managers can barley answers questions you may have while working. Most have to ask for help to even answer your questions (They'll just ask other agents) All in all it's an ok job with decent pay and paid time off and double time and a half on Holidays.
good,Good company to work for but the company does have a very high quota for you to meet each month.  You are not paid on jobs until it is installed.  Installation department often finds reason's not to install jobs.
good,"Stay focused on what you need to learn. Take notes. I enjoyed my job. I was the only admin person for awhile so it got fast paced & deadline demands came very quickly. I got a lot of work load done in the time I had. I also expressed I needed help. I worked there over 16 years. It was a very hard decision to leave, but I knew eventually we had to part ways."
good,"prospecting main part of the job, through networking, cold calling and referals and very few appointments from the company. however that is the easy part, getting your sales install is the harder part.. so much burrocracy that is no even funny. "
good,"The training you receive is some of the best I've had at any job and they fully prepare you for the types of calls you will receive. Everyone starts out on outbound calls, but don't worry, the customer is expecting your call. It is fast paced and you are calling people at a stressful time, be prepared to be yelled at and possibly cursed out. Many people start on the overnight shift."
good,"Handled all alarms, calling fire department or police, and contacting owner about the alarm going off.  Transferred calls to other departments when necessary."
good,"Great company and benefits, good exposure to complex accounting with opportunities to learn and improve. Accounting department is overworked and new management does not have a human touch. Feels like a factory at times, but the benefits and learning experience is overall beneficial to have. There is a lack of communication between departments. It is a fast paced and dynamic environment not for the weak."
good,"great team support, difficult technical information for products offered. revolving door of employment, including management changes and support changes often"
good,"My work day started at 0800. Our call center started at 0900 on the phones and would work until 1600 calling expiring contracts for retention. At 1400, I would have the marketing teams come in. They would spend the first half hour practicing their presentation and rebuttals on each other to warm up for the day. They would dispatch at 1500 to various neighborhoods that I had researched the days before. I would then use that time from 1500-2000 for interviews or training. Twice a month (every other week), I would train the 3-5 people I hired from the week before.  The culture of the workplace was professional and relaxed to maximize moral and minimize turnover. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the people who wanted to argue that they wanted to cancel after the system was installed. That, and the fact that the ownership of the franchise was very absent leaving me to essentially build and maintain a business all on my own. But the rewards of protecting a family with a system, or an elderly person with a ""life-alert"" style call button, is awesome."
good,Good company too work for. The work is interesting and rewarding. I myself enjoyed my time working for adt. It is a very big company with lots of oputunaties too progress and apply for various jobs within adt.
good,"Un espacio de trabajo bueno en cuanto a lo economico, solamente pocas probabilidades de crecimiento."
good,In the five years I worked for ADT things have changed. Company leads have gone down significantly company wide. Self generated appointments are the main profit generation platform. Lead generation dropped about 75% over the last 5 years.
good,"I am very determined person and eager to learn,have vision and hard work looking for a permanent opportunity as it Wil be a promotion and brighter futer."
good,"typical day of work includes going to a customers' home or business & installing an alarm system that was sold by a sales rep previously. Train the customer, complete all paperwork & take payments.  Jobs vary from day to day.  may have 1 to 4 jobs.  2 is most common."
good,Seems to becoming a Authorized Dealer and phone sales company which will eventually cut out actual Sales Reps.  Long time employees not valued any more. A once great company sinking at a steady pace. Management losing integrity for numbers which creates low morale. If Company starts focusing on employees again then employees can truly focus on customers.  Remember no customers no company.
good,"ADT was a great company when I first started out working there and then shortly changes began to come and the company went down hill from there. Nothing is wrong with change, however the company itself couldn't implement the changes correctly themselves. It was mostly the employees suffering because the lack of communication from headquarters to the people that actually help the business run efficiently."
good,Good place to work if you like the cubie's - not a fast enough place for advancement. You can get a ton of hours. Managements opportunities are limited. Overall a good place to start out.
good,Working at ADT is great the people are amazing and always willing to help. The group is like a very close family but the pay is not the best with the amount of work you have to do as a team manager.
good,Typical workday at ADT is taking inbound calls from customers with billing questions and concerns. I have learned how to put myself in the customers shoes the managers are there to assist with any escalated issues. I work well with my co-workers we continue to give each other ideas. The hardest part of the job is having to de-escalate  a irate customer because they were promised different things at the time they signed the contract. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and leaving a positive impresson of the company.
good,"I manage 6 locations and am responsible for high production of sales, operations and employee development.  I've learned a tremendous amount when it comes to just being involved in the every day to day operation , sales training, hiring and being profitable.  My staff ( management, sales reps, office staff) is what drives everything to work efficiently to make sure we provide the highest quality of customer service.  The most challenging part is the long hours and not much of a work life balance.  Overall a great company to work for but looking for new opportunities that will challenge me to succeed at my highest potential!"
good,"En general, una buena empresa. "
good,"the people were all friendly and very helpful when you had questions. Training was good considering how much there is to learn, but you learn so much more once you hit the call center floor."
good,"Ótima empresa para adquirir experiência com atendimento ao cliente, porem pouca oportunidade interna de crescimento"
good,"was a great experienced based on the type of customer service orientated person which I am, learned to polished my in home presentation to future clients, supportive management, a cut throat employee based mentality, it was a hard job to based your future starting new when priority was given to seasoned veterans"
good,"I believe in  learning,it  represents a challenge which I know I 'll relish,clearly already have extensive experience as admin manager .I m interested"
good,I worked with good people and the atmosphere with them was really good.  We had flexible work hours which was a nice plus & the work life balance was balanced.
good,"Great overtime availability very busy due to merger management can be more motivating the most hardest part is following behind agents who doesn't care about the clients , Ive learned that customer are first no matter what co workers are very thoughtful"
good,"I begin my workday at approximately 6:30 at the warehouse. I pick up the equipment I need for my assigned jobs. I leave the warehouse by 7:00 am and drive to the first customer's residence. Typically I do two jobs per day, each one lasting around 4 hours."
good,The corporate culture was nice.  My Manager was extremely supportive and supportive.  My colleagues were willing to help whenever asked.  I left because I found out the position takes about 12-18 months to ramp up enough to have consistent income.  I could not afford to do that.
good,"Always micro managing, managers never agree with each other, company has poor to non existent customer service.  company doesn't have control of local offices"
good,My manager is a great individual he will do anything to help you succeed. That's where the problem is... a lot of security companies are in the market now and ADT while they are the longest running company they don't conform to a changing market. The market is price driven and instead of keeping up with market they try to live on how long they have been around which does not work anymore. Customers want the best value for there money.
good,"I am happy to assist my customer if they trip the alarm by mistake and call even at mid of night. though it is not my job but the customer trust on me instead of calling call centre. I have got several appreciation letters from my customer which really keep me alive to strive for more. "
good,"If you are a true door to door salesrep with experience in your back pocket and looking for a company that offers excellent earnings potential, benefits, a product and company you can stand behind with integrity - then ADT is for you."
good,I installed both residential and commercial fire and security systems. Pulling wire and fishing wall was a daily event. Although I really liked commercial work I was very good at fishing walls in residential. When Tyco split the residential and commercial companies I got left in residential install. The managers started pitting one installer against the others and the work environment suffered.
good,"ADT gives tremendous latitude for managers who are new and looking to progess in their career.  Opportunities are around every corner. "
good,"It was nice helping others, handling alarms can be pretty nerve recking but once your there and know what to do it becomes a lot easier."
good,"If your going to workin the alarm industry ADT is the only place to work.... Corp or bust... Best system willing to drop prices to get order. "
good,"Very good company. EHS most valuable to the company. Friendly staff. Great opportunity to become a competent person."
good,This is a commission based company and I feel that when I worked there that the sales reps were working too hard and not compensated according to their performance. I have a very strong selling technique but as for the company to many downfalls
good,"Answer calls related to alarms."
good,"Too much drive and commission pay with low training."
good,"must upgrade and up sale in order to succeed and make more money and support from upper management was not always available, how ever I did enjoy and like very much doing this type of job."
good,"Typical day 8am - call center - worked all HOA association calls, for issues of home alarms not functioning and resolving their problems, collecting EFT payments or upgrading their existing systems, calling the sales people for the correct pricing of each different individuals. No personal conversations with fellow employees due to microphones pic up all fed back background noise. Defusing a bad hostel customer is sometimes difficult. Co-workers are a huge part of the center for feedback and communication with managers and field manager and technicians as well for price or discount approvals. Learned to be patient and listen first then resolve in a timely manner. Hardest part of the day not getting a call or email back from the sales force to comply with time and a returned call to defuse upset customer. Most enjoyable part of the day is satisfying my customers needs."
good,"Excellent benefits, very understanding of work/life balance. Little opportunity to advance past middle manager. Very stable position but don't expect to expand your skill set."
good,Its a very high volume call center where only production matters. Little or no regard by management for the value of their employees. They do offer nice benefits and salary.
good,"I am my own boss mostly, go out and around to different area promoting the products. Sometimes just promote through social media or cold calling."
good,it was field work and we often had to query about our commissions. if im bringing in money i also need to be well paid.
good,A typical day at work is fast-paced. You have to learn to muti-task to be an effective team player
good,"typical day at work would be on the phone for hours generating business, follow up phone call, in the field or driving in my car. I have learned that I love the flexibility on the job. management and co-workers got alone well. losing a sell. the flexibility."
good,"Processing alarms, inbound calls regarding monitoring,billing account details.Client problem solving of systems."
good,Great place to work until they do a shift bid. You could end up working 330-midnight which is not ideal for a single parent.
good,Great company to work for. I really liked my job. The only reason i left ADT Security was to start a job in my career field.
good,I didn't really care for the micro-management that was going on in the company. My co-workers were great. I miss some of them. The best part of the job was talking to technician for all over the United States.
good,aquí aprendí mucho sobre las alarmas de seguridad y sus componentes
good,"It's a very high paced and stressful office atmosphere at the sales office with several co-workers and customers in need of assistance, administration works never runs out. Job security is high as a member of the office staff.  Many co-workers are very knowledgeable, however a part of the office staff doesn't have passion for the business, internal, or external customers and lacks teamwork. The hardest part of the job is not having much room for advancement as a female and an abundance of male managers due to the nature of the business. The most enjoyable part of the job is there is very little micro-management in administration and the company has good benefits. I have learned that the sales world can be a hostile environment, but you can use sales as a stepping stone to advance to corporate positions if you are willing to re-locate."
good,A typical day at ADT begins with a meeting every morning--- going over our scripts and other ideas. Then out into the big world we go; we get into a van and travel out to neighborhoods with the most break-ins. I would get with another sales rep and go door to door trying to convince homeowners that ADT security systems were the thing to have to protect themselves from crime.
good,"A typical day at work was to wake up early to make a schedule to door knock a select territory where homes had recent break-ins. Understand the new sales promotions.   "
good,"In a typical day I would carry out cash collections, banking, clear old debt and disputes and and aim to achieve targets. "
good,A structured call center environment. I work in the ADT dealer department. I help dealers that call in to make sure they know how to fill out the legal contracts the customers will be signing. I advise them on paperwork issues that need to be addressed to get their accounts funded. I assist them with questions on guard fees and location permits. Involved in the education of the dealers how to access and navigate through the dealer website. I process cancellation letters for customers. I work on special projects to get as many accounts purchased as possible.(some overtime required) When issues are not resolved I notify my manager to enlist their help to get answers to make production run smoother.
good,"I loved working at ADT, the pay was decent, you could be somewhat flexible with your schedule and the training was good. Unfortunately I had a horrible manager which in the end was the reason I left. If you called in with a question, depending on his mood, he might spend 10 mins. screaming at you over the phone...so loudly that my customers could hear...he did it to everyone. But I did enjoy selling their products.                                                                                                             "
good,"Trabajar, parar para comer y hablar con los compañeros."
good,"I work any day and any time...and i learned about some news skills : Work in multicultural  environment .....manage time, and work in a Team with Colleagues or Co-workers....And the hardest part of my job is work in busy environment without Team...but I really like it ...."
good,would start around 6am and end of day pulling back into driveway around 6pm. Delt with traffic and mostly upset customers due to my job of fixing what others couldn't or wouldn't fix. I would deal with dispatch but prior to being dispatched I used to handel my own schedule.
good,"rather not express my concerns about this employer, really im just looking for a job closer or that can compensate somehow for the traveling."
good,"ADT, LLC works hard a creating a good work / life balance for all employees."
good,"A very easy going but structured call center environment where I learned how to multi-task, have patience, and how to work well with people. Management was there when I needed them but also gave me freedom to handle business. The hardest part about the job was staying up for 8 hours straight doing the same thing over and over, call after call. What I enjoyed most about the job was the fact that we were paid every week and not bi-weekly."
good,"It was a very face paced job but it wasn't anything a person couldn't handle. The trainers make sure you fully understand what to do before the put you on the floor. The management was decent as well as the pay. There was a very friendly environment, if a superior wasn't around and you needed help, your co workers around you had no problem helping out."
good,"A typical work day at ADT Security is to wake up and already have your day planned out collectively from the previous days. You will have company scheduled appointments, as well as self generated appointments that you set up using methods such as cold-calling, door-knocking, and obtaining referrals from existing customers. Every day is different as far as where you go, and who you meet. You create a prospect list around each sales appointment of potential customers, and either before or after your sales appointment or installation appointment you attempt to set up future appointments with these prospects. I have learned excellent time management skills, as well as how to overcome objections in multiple scenarios. The part of the job which is least appealing to me is the inconsistent schedule. One day you might work 8-5, where as the next day is 8-8, and the day after that is 10-8. I am not opposed to working long hours but having a schedule and a goal is something I prefer."
good,"typicall day at work log into phone ,expected to take inbound and outbound calls adhere to cph,dollars collected and provide world class csutomer service without use of after call. If you go above and beyong to help customer and exceed your break time you are penalized and expected to miss you break time for helping the customer."
good,Co-workers are fun and nice to work with. Salary not bad for the type of work. Benefits are good.
good,Great place to work! Great product. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"I worked in the Service Department at ADT for 10 years. I spent the day on the telephone to customers, ordering engineers stock, opening service calls on the system and closing them down."
good,Sold burglar alarms and surveillance systems to small businesses in the Orlando area. Spent most of my days cold calling new businesses or on the phone with clients.
good,ADT is a good place to work at. The management was always there to help if you needed assistance or any questions as well as my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to great people/customers on the phone who were very delightful and made my job worthwhile.
good,This is a company you would enjoy working for if you are not a fast pace employee who likes to move their career and fast pace. It is good if you are a team worker and you enjoy an ever changing environment. However the pay is not what you would expect for all the work you do. Negotiate you salary before you accept their offer!!
good,"Working for ADT was the worst experience  for me since they don't even take the time to understand you, I was in Training and long story short the lady messed up and lied and they didn't do nothing about it. They are really unfair on their decision and with us employee"
good,"My employment at ADT was actually overall pleasant and the job was beyond easy to do. It was all a matter of following directions and just providing a good customer service experience. I'm not so sure it's the company so much as the managers themselves that make a point to make the work environment more tolerable within reason. The General Care section was and still is in my opinion run very well and even with my unfamiliarity with a call center environment at that point had no issue picking it up and running with it. I wound up getting promoted to Customer relations 8 months later and it was the same case there. The culture in the customer care side of the company is actually very much in line with what I believe a customer care experience should be. "
good,"The people are nice, there was a good pay for that role.. However, you have to be comfortable and able to manage a bit of a chaotic fast-paced environment."
good,"A typical work day is usually routine on occasions there may be unwarranted change."
good,"Great people to work with. Being part of a local branch, speaking to local people and helping them was a great privilege. Having a great group of management to assist customers is great too."
good,I really enjoyed work environment  and the company valued employees ideas. I would encourage individuals that want a job like this to go and apply. The company could do better in giving employees room to grow and acquire ne skills.
good,"This can be lucrative when everything falls in place, however everything will not always fall in place. This position is both commission based and base pay. However, most job will only complete one type on base pay."
good,"This company is a descent company to work for because of benefits, fellow employees and easy to learn material for work. The pay isn't well and you will little to know chance of advancement."
good,good company to work for if you know how to deal with different personalities. Company changed drastically once it became a publicly traded company.....
good,"Management was good. The position was an entry type position and was not really what I was looking for."
good,"Door to door sales is a revolving door. You can make great money in this business, and I was able to accomplish that. Some weeks/months are much better than others, but you need to stick with it."
good,This job was more of a data entry job for me .  I worked with equifax and ran credit reports to see if potential clients qualify for our services.  The workplace culture was a bit unorganized but tolerable.
good,ADT is the best out there. But most of your competition as a rep will come from their Authorized Dealers who sell the same service for half the price.
good,The new upper management had consistently removed benefits and sales tools one after another until it became difficult to trust that the company supported it's reps.
good,"My biggest complain was with management.  My direct supervisors (I actually had two in my time there) were excellent.  Knew the products, easy to talk to and fair to work for.  However their supervisor was invisable and the few times you did see him, he almost had a distain for the sales people"
good,"Typical days of work began with a minimum of five consecutive calls to sales, management, and customers. Job assignments were distributed based upon assumption rather than customer care. The company provided a company vehicle and excelllent benefits. Work expectations were often blurry and inconsistent. Management was not professional nor empathetic to work place concerns."
good,"Morning calls with manager and team, target new leads and surrounding area, then out to the field for prospecting and any potential appointments.  Setting at least one appointment a day is company standard.  Accessible to all tools and resources from day one, through life of employment.  Peaks and valleys, as any sales job.  Lucrative pay out when business is busy.  Tough when market is slow.  Open schedule is difficult if one is effectively managing their time, but allows for more freedom than any other occupation."
good,"Good pay, call centre based work, decent office area but long days, harsh targets and a lot of customer service based issues and changes within the company when i was there."
good,repetitive work and lots of gossip between employers. Not enough pay for all the work that was done by employees. The only good thing was the benefits.
good,"My installation manager hired his poker buddy and gave him all of the easy, high-paying wireless jobs, leaving the difficult, low-paying hardwired jobs for the rest of us. Before that, it was great."
good,"If you apply for this postion, expect to spend the first 2 or 3 months looking for jobs and dont expect all of them to sign your contract.  It takes practice to get a perfect pitch and that means losing sales in the beginning."
good,At this time it is a suitable place for beginning a installation career. As. Far as longevity you might out grow it. Decent work environment and excellent and knowledgeable coworkers.
good,ADT was awesome! Ioved their management and the culture they had built there. The training was intensive and thorough and the trainers worked very well with the new hires to make sure they understood what to do and felt confident before they hit the floor. Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
good,"ADT encompassed all the aspects of a sales position that I thrive on.  The training, the poor management and the lack of support however is horrible."
good,Great company to work for.  Management great always willing to help out if needed.  As for team members also good company to work along beside and learn.
good,Decent place to work. If you like a nonprofessional environment. If you like working in a call center this job is for you.
good,Commission changed dramatically other than that its a good job the people are great but they need to change the pay. Schedule is flexible to help out benefits are not the best but are good. Nice vacation time.
good,"I am an At Risk Customer/Loyalty agent with ADT. Covering everything from billing, tech support, saving customers from canceling, etc."
good,"ADT is a very stable and established company with very rigid standards about how to do business. I worked for them twice and enjoyed the experience both times. The best thing about the company is the fact that you are working for the industry leader. The position I held before with the company put me in front of existing customers constantly and I enjoyed solving their problems, but this time as commission sales I found it too undependable as far as compensation. So if you enjoy a position where you can certainly attain great rewards this position would be for you. If you find that a dependable paycheck is more important, it is not."
good,The money is the only thing that kept me here so long. Soon as the commission changed I had to go. Management is terrible. Save yourself the trouble I wouldn't apply.
good,"Le personnel assiste rarement l'employé. La compagnie possède beaucoup de problème avec les ordinateurs (programme d'appel lent, qualité du son basse, heure de travail peu adapter à la clientèle)"
good,"Its sales so don't expect anything steady however, if you are self-motivated, high-energy, and willing to commit to long hours, this is the job for you! The pay can be extremely high or very low, you decide."
good,Drive to customers home design a system for them sale it. Make lots of cold calls. Meet sales goals and self generated sales. Great company over all.
good,The management was not good. Was no fairness as some people got more and more work and others   was asked to do less and less  and bad attitude to some  and not others. Employee(s) cheated on time and management was well aware and said nothing. Just signed off on it.
good,There tends to be a lot of favoritism at this branch; other than that you are left todo you work without being micromanaged.
good,good company to work for just wanted to move to new location would recommend  the to anyone looking for a good solid career.
good,"As a sales manager, if you were wiling to build, coach and mentor a strong sales team the earning potential was there.  "
good,"Challenging work culture,great training and compensation program.  High Turn-around in Sales, poor Customer Service and client retention."
good,"just somewhere to enhance your skiils and make good money on which you have to earn. don't  have nothing bad to say, they will hire you if they see you have potential"
good,"me and my teamworkers were hardworking door to door salesman. We met many different people daily that helped advance our skills with people, familiarity with the products we sold and how to handling certain situations."
good,"Decent pay, a lot of overtime available. Call center is open late so must have flexibility. they have a cafeteria on site which the food was amazing"
good,A D T is a very replicable company to work for.  Their benefits are rather good. The managers show care & concern. They've established a nice employee dispatch cafe. They have spirit day/Wednesday  wave Friday.
good,ADT does not value their employees as much as I expected.  I learned how to really value my customers and be empathetic with their needs.
good,I worked as a cold caller upon starting with ADT.  I was being moved to the Helpdesk two months later due to my ability to work with field technicians and salespeople.
good,"Conduct demonstrations and presentations of entry security systems, CCTV, and burglar alarms. Responsible for designing, layout, estimate time, equipment cost, type of systems for small businesses, corporate & commercial properties. I developed market and business relationships both in public & private sectors."
good,"•	Organized meetings with new and established clients "
good,"Great Benefits, Never could change work Hours from original new Hire."
good,"enjoyed working for this company. However, would have been more successfull providing additional training opportunites were offered on systems that we were selling. took personal initiative and request further training. however, it was something that was not offered.  left company to move to Austin"
good,"At first I loved the company but than they change the pay plan... "
good,"Training is extensive, and the staff that do the training are really professional. The major problem with the company (at least the call-center branch in town) is that the HR management is unhelpful, degrading, and incompetent."
good,"My day consisted of punching the time clock and getting straight to work, inputting data into the system. I was constantly at my desk with little to no breaks. I would have my typical lunch break, but end up coming back early to assist with a customer or technician. "
good,"Must be able to make executive decisions"
good,"I like the company and their values, especially how they treat the employees. this only thing is their so behind in technology and its very irritating at times."
good,"bel environnement beaux locaux, formation instructive et emploi facile"
good,"Call center jobs have a reputation of being monotonous, and this is absolutely true of ADT (formally Brinks Home Security); however, the corporate culture was phenomenal when I accepted the position as a Customer Care Specialist for the latter-mentioned company.  The management was very empathetic and caring, the training was thorough, and the work environment was very comfortable."
good,"•	Developed and maintained referral sources associated with the home security industry within a specified territory."
good,I learned about the typical methods of sales and how to present them to make people want to buy the product.
good,Well another door to door job.
good,"Training was minimal, they throw you right in to calls without making sure you have all the information you need to give to customers. They do not care about you as a person. I NEEDED a day shift, but they would not let me switch. So I ended up having to miss work and got fired."
good,Excellent comapny to work for wanted to transfer within the company but no opportunities available at the time.
good,I would go into the field door to door and canvass. I learned how to be excited and motivated. Hardest thing was I had to knock on at least a 100 doors.
good,Going out to homes and businesses to install alarms. I learned a lot about electrical things. The management was pretty good. I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that you could not leave until it was done and sometimes you ran into problems that would last for hours. The best part of the job was knowing that they were recieving a quality product and follow up service.
good,un día típico en el trabajo: TRANQUILO
good,"Good co-workers, some managemnent were very hands on. The traing was very through. Learned a lot."
good,"ADT is the largest Security Company in the US but does not always appreciate it's individual customers or employees. Looking at the ""big picture"" sometimes does not equate to World Class service that we all strive for"
good,Una empresa internacional con muy buen ambiente laboral y condiciones laborales
good,Overall  the atmosphere was ok ADT hires older and younger adults with intensive training. If you wanted to advance there is opportunity to advance  at s entry level team player.
good,"no vto"
good,"我每天工作主要包括监控华人客户的家用/医疗警报器，负责定期帮助华人测试警报器，并与维护人员沟通。"
good,"working at ADT, I am responsible for performing tasks like taking calls, scheduling appointments, ..etc  I have learned to be more agressive when it comes to being in a call center environment."
good,ADT was a very great company and did provide all the things that in this field one does need. The only challenge was not very strong on one on one trainng. And at that time no sales manger in about 6 months.
good,If you're into door-to-door sales then this is the job for you. Management is friendly and also very helpful. Hardest is keeping up with quota. I enjoyed the experience.
good,"ADT is going through ""merger pains"". It is being merged with the smaller security company Protection 1.  There are constant changes that require flexibility, but a person can only be so flexible. The entire moral of the Provisioning Field Support department that I work for, has dropped. Everyone seems to be stressed by the new expectations set by the CEO. We are being cross trained to support multiple departments but aren't receiving extra compensation. I really do like the professional and personal growth that I have experienced at ADT. I just hope that the changes from the merger will be more beneficial than alienating to the frontline agents."
good,Working for ADT became more rewarding when I incorporated carbon monoxide sales and education into my work day. My direct manager was great to work with.
good,"•	Increased number of customers by 130% in 3 years"
good,good job common biased need to upsell but they will take care of you as long you put your part great experience  meet lots of new people you have to drive
good,"A friendly environment, but very results focused.   A competent training department and chain of command which helped employees retain customers and do all the mandatory required over time."
good,"For anybody looking for a fun fast-paced environment. Great management and compensation, and the ability to assist in saving lives."
good,Ive been working with ADT for a couple months and its an ok job. One thing i hate is that training is late (3:30pm-midnight) and once training is over i was stuck with the shift 2:30-11 and NO ONE worked with me I am in school and also have a small child.
good,"I was in the training period, before I left to further my career.  But the time I was there, management was very helpful in teaching."
good,still a dead end job. there are chances to move around in the company. wont really wanna move up. management is highly lacking no matter what department. recently bought out by Apollo (protection 1 parent company). things are worse since the buy out.
good,"Hired on as a receptionist through temporary service. After 7 months hired on as a full time employee. Promoted to mailroom administrator, then to billing administrator and then to Senior biller."
good,"Although it gave me the call experience I needed and wanted, I realized a call center job was not in my area of job interest. I gained the knowledge to execute calls in a quick state and under-pressure. I also, learnt to handle my time as well."
good,"great benefits"
good,working 12 hours a day 7 days a week its not a joke its very tiring and alot of stress that you need to handle at the end of the day and keep your customers happy.
good,They will never fire you at this job unless you really suck!!! A typical day would include you going to get those self generated for the company because that's truly what matters!!! Go get those leads and you won't have to worry about anything else....but definitely don't look for much else the company has definitely changed and at this time we can't tell for better or worse. Good luck!!
good,A typical day at work would consist of answering the phone and fulfilling customer requests. Helping other co-workers with emergency dispatching or answering any questions they may have. I have learned how to handle emergency calls as well as how to trouble shoot alarm systems. Working with the management can be the tricky part because some of them act as though they don't want to be there so they have an attitude with the rest of the crew. The most enjoyable part of my day would have to be the fact that I was able to successfully put a smile on somebody else's face.
good,"Great work environment.  Liked the fact that you could work from home when you had local appointments."
good,"-Productive, on the phone all day"
good,"Managed office, and phones.  Prepared, and sold moving contracts.  Sent workers out, and performed time management on all jobs and trucks. Marketed fliers to apartment complexes throughout Colorado.  Learned to run an office, and manage a team of workers."
good,"Fast pace environmentm, high call volume, typically the same expectations on a day to day basis. Proffesional and friendly staff, great company."
good,Adt was a great place to work. I loved that the hours were early and I was able to be home with my newborn. Staff and Management were very friendly at all times. I loved that Adt always encourage us to strive.
good,Get in do my job and leave. Management was strict but well organized. Co-workers were okay. Hardest part was focusing on my work. I enjoyed the pay.
good,"Fun work environment and good management"
good,"Typical day- On the phone from 7:30am to 4pm daily making sure that I adhere to the scheduled breaks, call handling & procedures."
good,"A typical day at work involves me doing reports meeting with my team members explaining current stats and going over all promotions and closing tools to ensure all clients needs are met. I've learned to communicate effectively no matter what the situation is. Management is a great tool I've put to use, I put together my communication skills and leadership skills to be successful in managing my team. The hardest part of my job is getting paid commission only. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people daily."
good,"The company is recreating itself since the spinoff from Tyco.  Adding stellar management to the team to drive the organization forward.  Competitive compensation and benefits.  Better than that, is the talent.  Some of the best in the business!!"
good,"Working at ADT was different because it was my first job ever touching a computer and consisting of multiple managers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work the computer and verbiage for the job. But management was patient and taught me well. It was a call center environment for the first time I worked with different personalities which turned out to be quite interesting, and I met a lot of good people.   "
good,ADT knows how to make the employees feal like they are appreciated in incentives as well as in employee appreciation events. This is an ideal company to referr someone to.
good,"I worked as data entry for this company. Pleasant work environment."
good,"pro cust service, adt is a good company that works with there team members."
good,"Awesome management; awesome co-workers; difficult customers, high prices"
good,"A typical day at work would include processing over 300 adjustments to separate accounts and or sending 300-500 insurance certificates. Once a month I was also responsible for merging excell spreadsheets into word documents, printing and mailing documents per customers request. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was hearing the thank you's from customers and my manager for a job well done!!! Customer service is my passion!!!"
good,"You get what you put into it. I enjoyed working there, but working for commission only is well... working for commission only. If you can stay hungry and motivated it can be financially rewarding but for every big week there's a bad week. Better be able to budget and not live paycheck to paycheck."
good,Very rewarding when keeping in mind that you are helping people. hardest part of the job is 'selling' the product.
good,I had a great experience working for ADT. They have a great work environment and benefits.
good,"Great place to work, excellent team always there for you... Great manager always looking out for the customer and employee...The biggest thing I have learned is to be there for the customer, its a great feeling knowing that you help someone.."
good,"Honestly not a bad company to work for, I feel that they are to relax on attire people look like they rolled out of  bed or just came from the gym to work.  I also feel like it's favoritism always it's always the same people on top for rankings even though you have the same amount of revenue and sales."
good,The job was a good job I just wished there was a way we could have did the job from inside of call center environment because working outside in the winter was no fun talking to potential clients/
good,How would you wrap this up! the company I work at was a sub-contracted ADT service so it didn't have the same benefits as the original company.Soooooo
good,"This company needs to pay a little bit more for the employees. and needs to have sick pay. ( with the flu going around you would lose your job at this company if the doctor told you, You had to be out for two weeks with the flu. The only thing I did not like was you would get time counted against you if you were 1 min. late from break and you had to clock out to go to the restroom. Other than that it is Drama free no mess is tolerated at this company and you can move up fast if you go to work everyday be on time and be pleasant. If you know you cannot be on time and you will be calling off a lot do not apply for this job. It is a professional enviroment and they are always doing something for their employees. This is a positive place to work."
good,hardest part of the job is the customers and meeting company standards. it is a call center job enjoyable part is the team you work with they make the day go by.
good,It was a call center environment in the department I worked in. The particular department was new ( Loyalty retintion) It was a temporary job and I enjoyed it. Being that it was a new department within the company things were a bit overwhelming at first however manage did a great job with training.
good,"It was a very stressful environment with multitasking and using multiple systems. The stress I could handle but the lack of assistance and difficulty with the systems made it hard to do my job. As an Account Manager we had alot of pressure , we were above the CS supervisors and did multiple tasks to ensure our clients met there needs. Although I enjoy working under pressure there wasn't a lot of time to be able to follow up so i would come in on weekends to catch up. For the most part we had free range to use our best judgement with the customers so not only did we work independently but also team oriented for the best interest of the company. I originally was going to be moving to Kansas City but unfortunately I left the company abruptly due to my father having a stroke. He is now in a facility that can handle his medical needs and I have decided to stay in Wichita with my family, which is why I am looking for a career here."
good,I actually love working here I don't like the politics but you'll have to deal with that anywhere you're not your own boss lol the company is filled with people who is willing to work with you and your situations just communicate with them... If you do your job you won't have any issues
good,It was a decent job with decent commission but the base pay was horrible. The management pushed you to be successful without it coming off as a threat.
good,"Day to day working with a coordinator to help guide my day to the best completion. completing work that is asked of me and satisfying any all customer needs. Management can be a bit challenging to work with from time to time, and it has built a somewhat sad work environment as lots of employees don't enjoy their work."
good,"I enjoyed being in the military as an individual the different opportunities available are endless. There is the opportunity to have great benefits and do a lot more after being in. Educational benefits are endless and you can also retire early, relocate different places and are also offered different opportunities to get student loans paid for along with being able to get into a government based job in the long run."
good,"Always a great day and a lot to do."
good,"I worked my way from the bottom, to an owner position."
good,"I was a central station dispatcher.I was a customer service representative,I answered questions and concerns about their service and options with the company. I enjoyed helping people. I work well with others."
good,"Learned to time manage, stay level head, understand customer's concerns, product knowledge, working as a team, having goals and always having a go out and do it effort."
good,i started in the customer service dept and moved to the accounts receivable dept was a very good company to work for and was supportive of my educational adventures
good,"I work with some lovely people and enjoy the job. The work ethic by management is questionable, you are not treated very well if you are below them. "
good,I'm flexible if there is a change in schedule. The hardest part of a job is unrealistic deadlines and expectations.
good,Making calls to customers and scheduling appintments to get customers setup with ADT Security.
good,"bueno."
good,High pressure job dealing with distraught customers and proper authorities.
good,"I enjoyed working for this type of company, loved the customers and the co-workers."
good,"wake up at 04h00 in the morning,"
good,my day started at 3pm - 1130 pm I enjoyed to be able to help customers with there alarms by calling the police or fire departments then speaking with them
good,Great company to work for if you enjoy working outside commuting at least 25 miles on a daily basis.
good,"Was approached by ADT to manage several accounts. "
good,"I worked for ADT for a little over a year. I left the telecommunications  contracting industry to work there.  The money wasn't what i expected it to be, and the company switched my pay from weekly to biweekly pay shortly after i started.  After 10 months the pay scale was switched from package pay to merit based/point system based, and my biweekly pay severely dropped as the work load slowed up. It was a friendly and organized environment otherwise."
good,"Flexibility to work remotely home, travelling etc.... Nice gym, hair salon, spa, doctor office, shoe repair outdoor patio for lunch. Cafeteria cater to all different diets, lunch discount."
good,"A typical day was going to someone house, and a lot of talking. I learned how to talk to people in a professional way. Management was great. The workplace was quiet. The was not anything hard about this job. The most enjoyable part was getting to know people."
good,ADT is the premier security services company in the security industry.  ADT continues to be innovative in the market place and compete to maintain a 90-100% market share of the security industry.
good,"working for ADT was a great career opportunity until they closed my department and unfortunately, I did not have the means to relocate; i'm thankful for the opportunity though."
good,Overall great company but does not really help when you have medical issues and make you do more things than should be required ............................
good,If your looking to climb the latter of success ADT is a great company to do so. With the company being as large as it is new opportunities are coming open all the time.
good,"Working for ADT is fun, you can meet many new people and experience many new things."
good,"Management needs to trust employees more and value their opinions. I had the opportunity to learn new job skills, which allowed me to promote within the company. I also, learned how to adapt to changes that were made within my company. I enjoyed getting to know my co-workers and building relationships with them. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency from supervisors and managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the opportunity to learn new job skills."
good,A typical day at ADT includes reaching out to customers and developing new business opportunities. At ADT I learned how to manage territories while being efficient and productive.The management at ADT is very subjective and dependent on what you can do as a Sales Representative. My co-workers were very friendly and upbeat. The hardest part of the job was scrubbing through tons of bad leads just to secure viable accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people from different walks of life.
good,"A typical work day consists of cutting grass and keeping the parks clean. I have learned that some of my coworkers are hard workers and some are not. The hardest part of my job is, dealing with the weather. The most enjoyble part of my job has to be, being able to lay back during the winter."
good,"ADT is a Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,"Selling and analyzing Pest Control needs for Businesses and residential. License required to sell Pest Control Services, ability to self manage time and sales funnel"
good,work day in office out of office worked close with sales reps after hours install co-workers great hardest part of job none enjoyable part installing securing families
good,"A typical day in the office starts at 7am with a walk around the department saying good morning to the early birds who made it in to work. I'll then review the previous days production and quality reports to view employee stats. Kudos are sent via email and during quick touch points to those who met goal for the previous day. Feedback is provided to those who did not meet goal. "
good,"A typical day at ADT is a little hectic. When arriving at work I would have to rush to find an open desk, set up my things and hope that the computers worked properly so that I could clock in on time. My co-workers were overall very helpfull when first starting out and very kind. The managment didn't seam interested in their jobs. My first manager was never available when I had a request but once I recieved a new manager issues were done immediately. I wouldn't say there was a hard part of this job. The material was very easy to learn and the overall routine was very managable. The most enjoyable part was making the customers day. I loved hearing that people were ok or that it was a false alarm and when customers would tell me I was very helpful. It's always nice to hear good things."
good,"It was nice adventure but they close the departement."
good,"And sell the right way.. you can make good money.  You pick the days and hours you work.. but there are sales requirements.  More you work, the more you make."
good,"Customer orientated- dealing with calls from customers who required their alarm systems repaired."
good,"the training is 6 weeks long, but the learning environment is awesome. A lot of fun and a great experience. The job itself is super easy. The training really gives you the tools to be successful."
good,"at the time I worked there it was fun but towards the end it was very messy with co-workers and management was not being fair I remember a time when one team did not get written up, and other teams did, I also had a manager that was not fair at all I don't know how it is now hopefully things have changed."
good,Great Job.  Training is great they sent us to San Fran.  Manager was never there he had in Raleigh.  Set your own appointments and closed your own deals. Lots of money.
good,"A typical day is call the home owner about there alarm going off and notifying the proper authorities if needed. The hardest part of the job is staying on the phone all day.  The most enjoyable part is the interaction between the homeowner, my fellow coworker and all managers."
good,Enjoyed doing costumer service worked and improving on my data entry skills
good,great pay great bonuses....have to be able to sell/ fun staff!  I learned how to sell and how to read people over the phone
good,Well enhanced and diverse.This is a great place to work and get to know management.
good,ADT as a company is ok. I believe once i made it in the door many opportunities were exhausted because everyone already has an alarm system or dont want one. I think Sales should at least receive a base salary if expected to meet quota of 12 sales a month.
good,Company is going through transition. Making a lot of changes do not know from day to day where the company is going. Not sure if the Company has the sales reps best interest at heart.
good,"Working for this company is an experience I will not forget. The days were productive and sitting at a desk for 8 hours is not bad. I was in a training class and I was taught how to provide world class service as well as obtain payments by check,debit or creditcard. The co workers were very unique and contributed to the company in a positive way. The most enjoyable part of the job was working independent or as a team competing against other teams. I also liked earning prizes and working with different team managers. I don't recall anything that was hard about the job."
good,"I have definitely enjoyed working fir ADT. I enjoy the people as well as the work. Lots to keep busy with. My bosses are very nice, helpful, patient and understanding. The only downside is it is now too fat of a commute, otherwise I would stay."
good,Very accessible and knowledgeable manager. Learned about the home health industry and really enjoy meeting new people every day. Co-workers are very friendly and always helpful.
good,Un trabajo en el cual te permitían crecer
good,"A great role, unfortunately not supported by management in regards to trained staff as work colleagues. Training was left up to Me which was NOT reflected in my remuneration. Promise of hourly rate update as per contract not met after the 3 month period promised. Crew staff were NOT trained in the function of the Vehicle or its safety functions which left me at great risk. Long hours per shift ( 14 hours + ) 4 to 5 days a week."
good,"Llegar sentarte donde ellos te dijeran y llamar , solo levantarte para ir al baño y almorzar... Aprendí a vender seguros."
good,"I was excited to get the job at ADT. The interviewer was great. Went in my first day and spoke with my new Manager, the conversation was all about how great he was and his accomplishments at ADT."
good,"Note, I worked for the company is a previous position under different ownership.  As a sales person who is 100% commission, they micromanage every minute of your day.  The reduced the vehicle reimbursement to save them money, not to help their employees."
good,"My manager recruited me, the interview was with him and he hired me two weeks later. I had no idea what commissioned based salaries were.  It was all a surprise to me."
good,"Micromanagement by a person that does not know how to manage in general is bad.  No team leaders, it is like you are on an island of your own.  Manager will not teach you anything, because they want to do everything on their own, and if you make a mistake, they will stand over your shoulder to recreate everything while screaming and cussing about it..."
good,"aprendí a tratar con los distintos tipos de clientes. me saque el miedo de hablar por teléfono,mis compañeros me ayudaron mucho dándome consejos sobre la parte de la venta. la parte mas difícil del trabajo era confiar en los gerentes por que a la hora de la paga eran muy desorganizados. todos estábamos en negro y para  la mayoría era su primer trabajo así que no sabíamos como manejar ese tipo de situación que a muchos nos genero desconfía y temor a que no se nos pague. lo que mas me gusto fue el apoyo y la buena onda de mis compañeros."
good,Good for someone single with no kids.  Basically no life outside of work
good,"all about work"
good,Freedom and flexibility. This job is 100% commission only and they can change commission structure at anytime.  Too many chiefs not enough Indians....
good,name recognition is awesome but working in the office is hectic and disorienting at times. intially got hired to be trained as a tecnician but was put in service dept without knowing products
good,"good job for some one straight out of high school with no  kids because the  pay is not good , but the people are nice and the work is easy  the hours are fair"
good,"Una buena empresa seria, dispone de un buen producto y prestigio a nivel mundial. Con un buen ambiente."
good,"If you work hard and willing to just work for great benefits then this is the job for you!"
good,"The system was very easy to learn and the hot keys where a big help to make my work as smooth as possible. A typical work day included, clocking in and answering the phone to assist the tech with setting up a system in a customers home and making sure the system was working and safe. Giving a conformation number when everything was set up correctly."
good,very rude. not helping employs. loved my job just not the company was treated very poorly. the only enjoyable part was helping people i loved working with customers.
good,"Appointments in customer's homes and businesses to evaluate their security needs. I learned how the fundamentals of having my own business. "
good,ITS a good workplace but the Managers need to give more time to the new employees.
good,you have to be logged in and on to time each morning you are greeted by all the wonder staff member whos been here before you and typically it take 5-7 minutes to get logged in and ready to assist customers are fairly do right by them and your all will go smooth.
good,"Is ok but can be better. Manager does not train employees, they are under constant meetings and or conference calls. "
good,A typical day at ADT is based on numbers being met and collecting while saving customers. Also including employee appreciation and recognition awards.
good,"I took the job to save up extra money for Christmas. I knocked on doors with the intent to book an appointment for an ADT security salesman/installer to come to the home at a later date. The worst part of the job was walking the neighborhoods in very cold weather, best part was getting paid."
good,i like it because i get to meet with different classes and kinds of people i get to interact go out to different locations in and around Maryland i get to learn more on hands on tech security for both residential and commercials.
good,I love my co-workers. They are the best part of this job and coming to work each day.  I love clients  that call in for service and want to learn. The clients that are not wiling to learn more about their purchase are  the ones that can make your day difficult.  Management is ok. Every one is matrix/number driven. For the majority they are not client obsessed. And some managers can make an employees day a nightmare.  Promotions are only for the new and the ones that senior management can train in the manner that they want them perform. One with education and experience will be overlooked for  the one that does not have education and experience.  The promotion process is less then desirable.
good,My field of work should be finance thus growth is constraint. Call centre is not a career i would want to explore but for work activity and progress..
good,"Long unpredictable hours but part of the business.  Training and support could be better, also financial support to get started."
good,The company is okay just feel as though you should make more for all the work you do! Good advancement opportunities. Some people in management really care
good,Move shifts around with minimal thought to how it effects staff.  management never around to support staff.  High level of turnover in the job role at this premises and no effort by the management to identify causes and increase job performance
good,Top down communication is lacking.  Strong dedication from some long timers. Commission is not good. Some of the best roll out quickly. Non salary sales reps are forced to work 6 days a week. Commission is poor
good,Local office management and personnel were always supportive.  Middle management seemed to be disconnected.  There was a new Area Sales Manager every year for the 4 years I was there.
good,Excellent company to work for and it was unfortunate that ADT (as the bigger group) had massive 'accounting problems' that forced the closing of the Service Sales team merging into the wide Sales team.
good,Over the past 17 years I have learned alot of new skills from working at ADT. The hardest part of the job is really not knowing when you will get home at the end of your shift. A big perk is having a company vehicle to take home which is nice.
good,"Performed a dual sales manager and sales producer role; active “hunter” who met sales quotas by utilizing strategic networking, cold calling, and door to door marketing campaigns."
good,"A typical day would be answering phones and waiting for an alarm to appear on the monitor.  The atmosphere was easy going, slightly boring for me. Those, like myself, that were easily bored, would be given multiple tasks at a time.  Management loved the days I was scheduled because I would work on special tasks to remove ""low priority alarms"" from the queue.  I could be sending the police to a home and taking care of a ""Low Battery Alarm"", at the same time.  "
good,A typical work day is busy and can be stressful but laid back dress code. Management needs improvement. Overall ok place to work pay could be better as well.
good,I worked with ADT for a couple of years both in residential and small business sales. Sales were fantastic at first but then began to drop significantly due to the presence of other companies.
good,"recibir el trabajo a realizar, dirigirse al domicilio del cliente, ejecutar el trabajo mencionado."
good,Warm working  environment with sometimes supporting management.The most enjoyment part of the job is working alongside a dynamic team and learning from them.The challeging and exciting of the job is when stakeholders want their work all at the same time and one has to prioritise.
good,"I worked in the sales division, there's an opportunity to make money but the variables and the footwork you put in through out the day can be discouraging when you don't have a base salary of pay."
good,I was able to give customer a sense of security and help when they needed it most.
good,I would place orders for customers and get the installers the materials that they needed for their jobs. I would also do inventory audits.
good,"Support outside Sales Reps, internally with booking appoints and other product or service needs"
good,I just expect more from larger companies and how they conduct there work habit.
good,"I enjoyed helping people protect their homes and families. I learned that ADT is a department of defense company, they are in 50 countries, on several continents, monitors the pentagon and has been in business for over 138 years. Management was great, my co-workers were great people, the hardest part of the job was people who did not want to pay for the top quality of ADT. Typical day in the office is prospecting and making calls."
good,"ótima empresa para se trabalhar e aprendizado de excelente qualidade."
good,my day begins as soon as I sit at the desk and sign into the agent website. My usual job is to make outbound calls and get customers to accept the offer of ADT home security. I have learned to always keep a positive attitude regardless of the situation I may have with dealing with customers on the phone.  The management and co-workers are easy to work with. The best part of the job is when I get the customers to accept the offer. That makes me feel that I'm doing a great job at sales and Im securing yet another home.
good,ADT really use to be a great place to work. We have been through a lot of management changes. Not much room for growth.
good,takes a lot of call for people who dont want to talk to us but it is not a hard job and is very easy to preform at.
good,Great place to work! The hardest part of the job was getting the techs on the phone to understand you could not provide them with a confirmation number if all points did not come through.
good,"aprendí a desenvolverme mas para hablar ,la parte mas difícil es llegar a vender 20 alarmas,me gusta mucho que sean muy compañeros con migo. muy buen clima laboral ."
good,it was a good job but just the employees and sum mangers made the
good,"The hardest part of the job was the driving, I would sometimes be on the road for hours, going from house to house."
good,This position requires a 6 - 7 day per week work schedule to include door to door prospecting and heavy telemarketing.
good,"I would recommend working here if you are entry-level and need to hone your technical skills and customer service. The pay is not that great, but the benefits are ok."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I was an outlier in that I serviced my entire state. The hours where long with a lot of driving. Self managed and motivated to complete my tasks. I loved my customers and what I did.
good,well off place to work was really one of the good ones never need to pay for much when working everything was some what given to you loved the lunch breaks
good,Excelente ambiente. Los objetivos son acordes al entorno país.
good,Loved working here. You have to be a hard worker to be able to fit in. Commission structure is great and pays if you work hard. A lot of cold calling required. Meeting a lot of new people.
good,required to knock doors 12 months a year. the staff are pretty fun to work with. the pay is ok... on paper it looks good until deductions come.. then half your pay check goes out the window lol
good,The company is no longer ADT and was bought out twice in the time I have been here. It is now Johnson Controls.   A typical work day is steady but not too busy.  Management is not the micro manage style unless given reason to do so.
good,Monday - Sat  team meeting at 6am- 7:15am then onto my first appointment at the customers home for a 3-4 hour time frame then a second install or service call then home.
good,I was able to meet a very really amazing people.  Some of which you only see in movies.  Its a pretty easy sale but can shock people when they learn the cost.  The sales process is very easy to follow as long as you take the time to really learn it.
good,"Although every branch was different, the Orlando office pushed so hard that everyone was stressed to the point of backstabbing and sabotaging others if it would make them look good. Everyone had to be out for themselves. It is a fast paced environment and there is a lot of opportunity for working independently of others. The pay for the commissioned techs is one of the highest in the industry, but they expect you to keep quiet about any workplace issues, even with other staff. It does not bode well for a team like environment, even though everything requires one.  New CEO's vision not with employees comfort or needs in mind. Unrealistic."
good,"Decent work, hardly competitive pay, terribly managed. Minor room for advancement, college degree preferred. Frequent changes in policy and poor support network."
good,Excellent opportunity for individuals interested in 100% commission pay structure.  First six months will be greatest challenge.  Networking is very helpful.
good,"Devido a varias mudanças na diretoria da empresa, a mesma esta em busca de novas adaptações e equilibrio."
good,"90% do tempo de trabalho efetuado em campo. "
good,"Commission is created to pay the most to the people who sell the most which is fair, but the calls are tiered so it doesn't provide a fair chance to all employees to make the sales needed for a good commission."
good,Throughout the years working for ADT Security services i have learned a lot and received awards. I worked hard to become an technician after i had been a wireman for years.
good,Meet and greet with customers. I would let them no exactly what I would be doing for them on that date. Install security panel. Explain all the features to the customer and be on my way. I learned everything about a DSC Impassa alarm system. The workplace was very relaxed. Hardest part of the job was doing camera installs. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was helping protect families from intruders.
good,Comp plan is changing every other day and nothing seems to be good enough anymore   Use to be a awesome place to work at. But now your treated as if your replaceable even if your one of the top producers  which is hard to believe when you have seen the amount of sales reps come and go as I have
good,"Working for ADT was great until they were sold to Protection one, In this area with both companies makes out market flooded and they wont' allow you to cross sell."
good,"Had a small gig with them for a while as a sales representative. It's a great company and the management couldn't be nicer. That said, this job is not for anyone, mostly because it requires previous knowledge of Miami businesses and a personal client list. Not for newcomers in town."
good,"""I was able to provide customers with solutions to protect their families. It was an amazing experience and gave me a sense of worth."
good,"Great trainers but stressors in management when on floor. Great place to work if you are looking for cs experience. Learned that there are a lot of things that go into securing property for individuals that need it. Co-workers are very nice and helpful. ""they want to see you succeed at all costs. the most enjoyable part of the job is the encouragement from co workers and training team. They were helpful and assisted you with help if there was something new that even they didn't know."
good,ADT is a great company to work for. I have flexible hours being a residential sales consultant. I enjoy cold calling and working hard for a sale. My role as a security sales consultant is to ensure I give the correct advice to my clients to ensure their safety.
good,ADT is merging with 2 other companies which were both purchased by a private investment firm. The direction of the company is not what im looking for.
good,"Deal with different queries, different people.  Because of this learnt  to deal with difficult customers.  Two IC of the team. Was a supervisor at Std Bank.  My co-workers are very nice people and very helpful.  The hardest part of my job is that sometimes you wait for other departments to give you feedback which either comes late or not at all until you folow up.  Talking to people the whole day is interesting."
good,"I enjoy assisting customers ,solving there issues. I look forward to seeing my co-workers, team meeting with all of us trying to brain storm to have the best customer service possible."
good,Door to door sales its very fun place to work and you actually enjoy you job if you are a good sales person. It is %100 comission based.
good,"We would go in the office and talk about the previous days work, we go over if anybody got sales or if anybody got in a house."
good,"When you start with this company, you are placed with different technicians to perform labor to help technicians do their work. I was used to run wire, clean up and basically general labor on larger jobs as needed. I had no real training until I was out in the field learning by my mistakes up to the last 4 months of my employment, only then was I trained in class room of how to perform installation and service correctly. I was written up for mistakes I made with no training. Long hours, no real home life. Product support, long on hold times..., causing issues with customers. The good part was meeting interesting and nice people. Hardest part is upsaling and collecting Funds as well as attic crawls, heat, and guessing how to take care of issues due to little support. Manager seldom available."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to complete my job to my fullest potential. I enjoy seeing the customers faces when they are completely satisfied with my work. It is a great representation of the company and myself. This is a fulfilling feeling!
good,Sales can be a great job to have.  There is so much potential in this line of work.  It's just a matter of one having discipline and patient.
good,A company always on the grow and advancing in technology each day. Had the opportunity to work with some of the biggest names in the industry. Great experience which taught me a lot of my skills sets that I use each day.
good,"Immediately responding to all types of alarms, as they are raised within the clients’ premises. Doing proactive patrols for security presence & visibility within the client surroundings. Doing possible arrests once crime found committed and the suspects found was a routine thing.There was no succes without co-operation.Management was strict when it comes to clients complaints. Co-workers were young friendly and teamed in spirit.It was hard when the criminals/suspects start the shoot-out,but the shoot-out was enjoyable cos we were well facilitated & high in continous shooting skills."
good,"•	Collect and input of sales account"
good,good employees and a great company to work for. made a lot of friends was a little tedious
good,"From 9am the beginning of work day, where we create a atmosphere before going on the fields around Manchester city."
good,great job and team members. I learned a lot in such little time.
good,commission pay job that require a lot of time away from home but it taught me how to manage time & how to be very productive
good,En este caso mis objetivos personales no acompañaron a lo laboral..... sin embargo las tareas realizadas dejaron en mi un aprendizaje importante a la hora de negociar y fuerte en cierres.
good,"I like the job but horrible benefits,  they dont care for there employees and the pay isn't bad for Field Tech Support. They always offer vto so you have a gokd chance of taking a vacay unpaid or using your pto. The best part is you have the ability to adjust your lunches and breaks unlike most companies. So if youre stuck on a call during your break, you can easily change it. The call center isn't in the best shape, they have two elevators and one barely works. The cafeteria food is horrible most days and parking sucks. Its a laid back job, easy money. Everyone comes in making something different.  It ranges from $12-16/hr but once you train for diff skills, there's a very slim chance for a pay increase"
good,Good job but was not a permenant job. Loved the customers and team members
good,this job is a great place to work as a starter job or someone in college.
good,"Mucho trabajo en equipo,alta motivacion para el logro de los objetivos,bastante planificacion y estrategias de venta ,"
good,You come in the morning for your daily meetings with supervisor.
good,"great company to work for,great hours and good pay.door to door knocks,getting in and out the vans,in various kinds of weather."
good,very productive work workplace that keeps you busy your entire shift
good,days are fair but the distance is on your mind throughout the day.
good,"My day consists of managing the day to day activities of approximately 30 employee's. I have learned a wealth of knowledge relating to management, project development and other important leadership skills over the last 6 years I have been in management. Upper Management for the most part is there to help you move up. And, I cannot say enough good things about my co-worker's great people who are there to help you no matter what. The hardest part of my job is the work-life balance. It is very difficult to accquire weekend days off and because of that hard to see your family and/or start one. Working every weekend and every holiday is a challenge for anyone but creates a bigger challenge when starting out your life. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to make a difference in your employee's life."
good,We had good team building together and we were sent on team building cources
good,Calling residence and businesses that had alarms systems that were in alert to send police to the location. I learned how to deal with customers that were panicing and upset.
good,"ADT runs under Tyco Corporation. They provide a number of tools and and a great training seminar to get sales professionals ready to drive their business. However, it is like driving your own business. Business is slow when you start and when business is slow the money is tight. It's almost like getting into the real estate business and insurance business."
good,If you enjoy call centers you will love this job! There is a monthly bonus that is avaible. Not is to get but not impossible either.
good,Bonus performers.and off the year you received bunus.And received certificate for working good in every 3 months with money.And when work hole roster.
good,"A sales rep I saw my manager maybe 2 to 3 times a month, we mostly talked on the phone and text or emailed each other.  You did need to have the ability to create or find your own customers, you would not make it on just company given leads.  overall it was a good experience, I learned a lot but, hours worked compared to the pay didn't work for me."
good,ADT was fast paced which made my day go by faster. Enjoyed working with the people around me. However the 3-11pm shift you are REQUIRED to start out with in the scheduling dept. did not work for me.
good,"stressful at times but a good job. Very difficult to move up. They always have someone in mind, but they try to act like you are in the running for the position"
good,"Preparation is key, be prepared to work effectively manage your time, stay on top of company initiatives and the industry on a whole, expect the unexpected, listen and provide solutions based on clients needs"
good,It was a difficult job. I didn’t really enjoy it it was temporary and was laid off. Great for people with sales experience or retaining customers. Upgrading accounts was difficult.
good,Been working at Adt for 8 years. I like the challenges with wire running and trouble shooting. Although they have a new numbers system they are countinuosly changing these numbers to the point that we are all stressed out to the max and that is the only reasoning for me looking elsewhere for work.
good,Typical workday involved direct calls with sales reps at customer locations.  Interface with customer issues in problem resolution.  Train and review daily planning and team activity.  Attend management meetings to review branch performance and budget adherence to meeting monthly targets. Workplace involved a large number of tenured employees of 10 years plus.  Very close scrutiny from senior management.  Enjoyed training and supporting my team on winning deals and increasing their opportunities for earnings and personal growth
good,"Not really happy with the way the company is going, products are not as good as other competitors and nothing changes after voicing our views to management."
good,You will have a lot of different security options to offer. So you will have to attend all the training on products to learn about them. ADT also has a very defined sales process. They will teach it and will expect you to follow it.
good,"This job consist of office work, I placed phone calls, did filing, any receptionist work through out the day good job just moved away from the area and had to find other work"
good,ADT was a great company and I worked for them for many years and was very successful. I enjoyed the fast paced sales position and was willing to put in the work and hours. It was a change in management that I did not like
good,Eu tive as maiores experiência de trabalho na ADT.
good,"Inbound center"
good,"very great company to work for , Every day is different and challenging, every one works as a great team, and every one communicates very well with each other when there are issues"
good,"A typical day at ADT would be get your daily schedule, run sales leads and communicate those opportunities back to management. Additionally, while at sales calls work the neighborhood in which we are assigned to try and obtain self generated business."
good,"Bonne expérience."
good,"Be prepared to work 16hr shifts, and if you're great at sales bring home the bacon! Great field to work in for learning technicians, although you will have to drive close to 100+ miles a day."
good,Good interview presentation with a very good manager at that moment. Made you felt relax and gave you a good understanding about what the job was all about!
good,"ADT is awesome. However, being in Account Management... helping people that are wanting to cancel... that is hard. ADT sets you up to succeed but nottaking the customers harsh words to heart was hard for me."
good,"to many cold calls per day to be successful, its a good place to work for if you have experience "
good,"Much needed adjustments to today's culture, and to make sure that their ear is always to the ground. Be sure to keep everything accounted for, and work hard."
good,Good place to work and learn about security system. The company had flexible hours and the staff where very professional . Energetic and enjoyable atmosphere
good,It has been a long time since I worked here but I learned a lot and was impressed by how they are concerned about quality and customer service. It was a fast paced but fun work environment.
good,Buena empresa con valores y lo esencial mucha capacitacion constante
good,"Learned how to design and install security systems in our Federal courthouses. We all worked well as a team to get the job done. There was stress for time sensitive projects, but we all came together to make sure work was completed."
good,"ADT is one my best place that i have worked so far."
good,"Show up do your job, follow the corporate guidelines all will be fine. Managers are supportive, teamwork is mandatory in making the day go by smoothly and quickly."
good,i would still like to be there i worked there for five years.it felt like we were making a difference in peoples lives thru their burglar alarm  system or the home health division to allow people to stay inside of their homes
good,"Everyone is nervous for their jobs because of the merger.  They have placed people in positions based on who they know, not what they know.   Staff is over worked and are expected to make up for anyone that was laid off."
good,good job but they change pay structure way too much . Its commission only so this becomes an issue . The management is also always changing so do not get attached
good,"ADT sometime can make you feel unappreciated and the leadership sometimes seem to forget about their front line employees. Its very easy to feel ""its not what you know its who you know"" to advance."
good,"I think ADT was an overall great company to work  for with very face pace stressful environment but management showed you ideas and constant help goals to achieve,"
good,"The employees I worked with including some of my bosses were great people to work with. I still keep in touch. We still meet for lunch."
good,Company is customer focused and less so on retaining excellent employees.  Although they are doing better in energizing employees but still needs improvement overall.
good,ADT is a great company to work for. They have good pay and great benefits. A typical day at work is either upgrading or installing a completely new security system for residential customers. I enjoyed learning about the different security systems especially the home automation end of things.
good,"ADT gave me my start into this industry as a commercial intrusion install technician.  I am grateful for that opportunity.  It's a big corporate company culture and all the ""stuff"" that goes along with it."
good,"-A typical day consisted of making 100 phone calls a day early in the morning to prospect and make an appointment with the decision maker to sell cameras or alarms. "
good,"Very face paced and competitive market. Daily cold calls, setting of appointments, called on clients at their businesses or home. I was assigned a territory and worked outside the office on a daily basis."
good,I have learnt the importance of a team work. Although this job is not related to my education even though I have learnt a lot. Meeting customer and deal with them are of the best experiences I have ever made.
good,It was a great company before they sold the businesses.   Busy and fun place to work.  Management was great and so were the employees.   I worked as an EA and HR Assistant
good,We started everyday off with an office meeting.  We went over how people's days went yesterday and how sales went.  We were hashed out areas to knock and driven out there by team leaders.
good,"ADT is a large company with large company policies and this takes the personal aspect out for its employees, generous benefits but not kind to a work/life balance"
good,"Great work/life balance if you meet or exceed your quota.  Very hard to get out of the dog house if once you don't meet quota.  Overall, the  company provides a decent commission plan."
good,"This is a company with a long history in one field and they are successful.  More focus needs to be put on retention, both of customers and employees, as the current way of doing business is add one, lose one.  During my tenure three associates have left."
good,"flexible with every day life, open 24 hours there scheduling around every day life is understandable. haven't worked here in years not sure how things are today.."
good,"The local office is not very big, so not many co-workers to interact with.  Had great perks due to being a large corporation.  Not a very stressful environment."
good,enjoyed meeting new people everyday. it was a door to door job. on the job i advertised adt home security. the system was free all the customers had to do was keep the system monitored.
good,Es una experiencia grata aunque poco movida. Estoy un poco más acostumbrado a hacer algo más de cosas.
good,ADT was owned by Tyco. There was a commercial and residential split where Tyco was the commercial arm and ADT was the residential arm of the security business. While both companies were successful. They went to business differently.
good,"Oldest security company in the world."
good,"Since I was not an employee but a contractor, I don't know the culture of the company.  As a contractor, I was very limited regarding access which made my job more difficult to perform."
good,as a tech we worked in very fast paced job. its been years since ive worked there. everything has changed. they got bought by protection one. im guessing that they are using pro ones rules
good,Typical day at work starts with Pandora. Then i open Mastermind and audit for 8 hours. I learned Excel and auditing. Management was nice. The culture diverse. Hardest part was staying excited to come to work though i do love accounting. The math and muc=sic was the best part.
good,It was a great experience working for this employer. Learned a alot about security systems but it also allowed me to acquire a vast experience in customer service techniques.
good,They provided good benefits and very involved with community projects and public safety.. The company was also very thorough with ensuring employees knew personnel rules.

good,good sales job with decent money and lot of flexibility. not too many growth opportunities. Too many changes in management .
good,Great place to get started in sales. Try to use your current networks as bases to jumpstart your business. Phone calls and follow ups with leads are critical to building the business.
good,I really enjoyed working for ADT. They have an awesome and supportive staff. I wish my medical issues did not get in the way of me staying longer because I really enjoyed it while I was there.
good,"Call on customers, network and cold call for new customer, I learned how to design systems and design camera's system.  I also learned how to design Access control and some Fire.  Overall management was good and helpful.  Co workers were like minded and helpful.  The hardest part of the job, was designing a job without mistake in the early years.  The most enjoyable was designing system that helped business customer see a return on their investment."
good,Excellent expérience de management en Comptabilité transactionnelle.
good,"A typical day at this job entailed visiting different public schools in need of refurbishing. With a group of people we would paint walls and blackboards, clean and decorate school grounds and overall just prepare it for the next school term. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to meet different youth and explore our strengths to accomplish our assigned tasks the most efficient way possible."
good,"Fast-pace, multi-tasking, simultaneously complete duties with high demands for availability.  No run for error, scheduling, rearranging, emailing, conference's , and  zero down time."
good,My first job working with computers. I was training others on the job after 6 months.  The system numbers for the alarms and the codes for different alarms was not hard for me to pick up on.  The hardest part of the job was when it stormed outside tripping alarms that needed to be checked to make sure it was not an actual incident. Having to call people in the middle of the night to tell them their alarm was not set was never pleasant.  The customer usually became upset. When an alarm goes off and found to be an actual entry alarm or fire alarm is rewarding when it's handled timely and taken care of properly.
good,"doing the best for the client is my business, always. and that keep the relationship good between my company and the client so everyone get the best"
good,"no benefits, very fun place to work , management could be a little  over the top , hours was not flexible , pay was very low , great job to have as a first job or a part time job"
good,"Oilfield work is not great for family life but the pay and benefits are great, it is a great starter job and there is progression for the right people."
good,This was one of my first places to work as an IT professional.  They took care of their employees.  They provided good training to get the job done.  Co-workers were young and energetic who were keen on learning also.
good,"No support. Product and support materials were not provided. "

good,Ok place to work. Great building. Very top heavy leadership. Who can say what is going to happen with the merger upcoming.
good,"Commercial Sales and Advertisement, distributing flyers and door tags providing  ADT customer  with recent and updated sales. Also persuading potential customers to join ADT in its ever growing expansion."
good,As a employee here one must be a self-starter and must be willing to work without direct supervision or guidance.  Other than that the job isn't terribe.
good,"ADT is a solid company and management is great.  To make decent money in sales however you are running 7 days a week, all hours.  Tough with a family.  Sales in commission only."
good,overall a good company to work for but not much growth opportunity. . but the head quarter is beautiful and great café inside the building
good,Management was supportive.  Coaching and training was available when needed.  Onboarding process to very detailed and made for an easy transition.
good,Working for ADT I have improved communication and time management skills. ADT is a fast pace company. One has to be able to multitask and adapt to change quickly Communication is a major part of this job.
good,"A typical day consists of checking emails and appointments in salesforce. Making a call sheet and following up with prospective customers and ADT pays partners. Making at least 50 calls per day and visiting with local real estate agents. Canvassing the area around one of your customer installations to drum up more business. I learned how to write out a contract, collect and process a payment, scan and download a contract for review. We had a great set of managers that were there to help you and very knowledgeable. Again I had one of the best trainers in the business to train me. My co-workers were great and were always willing to help when you needed their help. The hardest part of the job was all the driving you had to do to make a sale. The most memorable part of the job was making my sales quota in a week."
good,"Acercarle las promociones a las familias de variadas localidades, y concretar entrevistas entre las familias que se interesen por el servicio y el asesor de la empresa. Turno de cuatro horas y media. En un muy buen clima laboral."

good,"ok job, their turn over rate is horrible. treat you ok but have had better and more organized employers. besides that it was cool"
good,"On a typical day I am multitasking between listening to radio traffic, dispatching patrol officers and trouble shooting with customers via landline."
good,"Going in to work you pretty much know what you have to do because you have been trained to do it. Breaks are usually consistent everyday. Co-workers are pretty nice I mean you're not there to make friends you're there to work. Potential friendships can be developed. Hardest part of the job is sitting almost 8hrs a day, but you get use to it. I enjoyed helping the techs with the technical issues after doing so I felt good about it."
good,"I would deal with working with my coworkers on a daily basis. Sometimes with big projects. Prewiring houses, apartments, and buildings for security, phone, cable, CCTV and trimouts. Some times I would do installations after the building has been built. I would do programming and demos for owner to learn their systems. I would use a company vehicle to get to my jobs. The hardest part was crawling in attics and crawl spaces but this job had it's adventures on a daily basis."
good,"Day started at 1130 am and ended any where from 7-10 pm "
good,"I had a lot of fun here, however the management in the field was a little shady at times. But all in all, not bad. Travelling and staying overnight was a cool experience"
good,"Productive and very strict atmosphere due to dealing with emergencies."
good,Training is very thorough. Very flexible position. As long as you work closely with your supervisor you can make great gains personally and with the company.
good,"The people I work with are generally friendly and my supervisor is cooperative with me. Working at this company is sometimes stressful, but it is an easy job and I feel successful at it."
good,"Took inbound calls from technicians in the field pertaining to the connections of alarm in the residence, business, etc. I learned a more technical side of customer service in regards to connecting alarms and blueprints of how alarms work."
good,Adt is a great company to work for. They have great benefits and upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers on a daily basis and helping them meet their security needs.
good,Great experience for someone trying to gain an understanding of typical Washington day-to-day work.  Leading tours of the Capitol building greatly enhanced my public speaking skills.
good,"It is a big company. However, they don't provide health insurance or 401K. The pay is very little and the work load is a lot."
good,"As a people person, the most enjoyable part of the job was to do what I like: working with people, helping and enjoying customers and my co-workers, be a team player, doing bookkeeping and operate office equipment, achieve all key objectives established by the Company, be a role model within Business by promoting the institution's products and services at every possible opportunity etc..."
good,"May varied tasks and projects to undertake however, most of the tasks were very time consuming and the tasks themselves could be incredibly repetitive. Little to no training provided and no clear work structure. Very much on the job training however, this radically improved my ability to adapt to new tasks and learn quickly. "
good,"Busy and Challenging, Learned a lot out of the job, including working in a team, and varies of information management software"
good,The job is always changing from day to day. You are always in a new place and always have a steady stream of work. The benefits are also nice.

good,"lovely place to work and likely to move up in the company, new faces everyday."
good,"I have worked for Brinks/ADT for about 7 years, and when ADT brought out Brinks, the company flow changed, and departments started being eliminated."
good,First job great managers kind of wish I would have stayed there.
good,"In this role I would chase outstanding debt by telephone and by letter escalate accounts further when necessary. As first point of call to all telephone customers I was also required to carry out many more general customer service duties. It was a job in which I had many targets to reach on a weekly, monthly and annual basis."

good,Pretty good work environment. Just didnt have many chances to move up within the company.
good,The training staff is very thorough and will make sure you go through every aspect of your work day. By the time I completed training I was well prepared. Once I was on the floor the day is spent speaking to ADT Technicians verifying that the installation was done correctly.
good,"•	Management of Installation & Service Technicians"
good,I gained a lot of computer and phone skills during my employment at ADT. Typically the job entitles to be on the phone and at the computer all day while entering data into the computer. In my opinion was a very easy job and nothing was hard about it. The goals to be met were very reasonable and reachable.
good,"Large company with plenty of talented and collaborative team members.  "
good,"Dia típico, monitoramos os alarmes, fazemos contato com os responsáveis pelo local, e tomamos as providencias necessárias para dar tratativa a conta, se necessário acionamento do suporte ou PM, isso depende do cliente dispensar ou não o disparo ocorrido em seu estabelecimento e da solicitação feita por ele."
good,great work place great pay. love the job great pay the hours are just meesed up at times. a good day at work would be 2 jobs which take about an hour an a half so you would be home by 4 everyday and make $200 a day
good,Great Place to learn from some of the best minds in the industry.
good,You will find a lot of long term employees.  They must be doing something right to retain them.
good,I loved my shift from 5:30 AM - 2:00 PM . I learned that working in a call center involves a lot of changes and adaptation.
good,"Generally a good place to work, high energy and good benefits."
good,nice people. good management. The pay was ok for the job I was doing. The time off was pretty good as well.
good,I loved this job. I loved being able to help people with everyday living and teaching them new things. The best part of the job is that I learned something everyday from the people that I took care of and they teach you a lot about yourself as well.
good,"ADT es una de las mejores empresas para trabajar en cuanto al clima laboral y predisposicion por parte de sus administrativos a enseñar, controlar y brindar herramientas para desempeñar el labor de la mejor manera."
good,Perform a needs analysis then design the system to satisfy needs and install.
good,"ive learn to order parts, inventory , manage tech trucks etc"
good,ADT IS Colombia es un buen lugar para aprender y adquirir experiencia es por ello que las personas rotan con velocidad. No hay retención del talento humano y tampoco una política de capacitación interna. Es una empresa para aprender diferentes actividades y poder aplicar ese conocimiento en otras empresas.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, a typical day would be answering calls from technicians and customers and process data entry, place accounts in service, make sure alarm is working for customer. I would do a lot of troubleshooting, process payments and confirm that everything is working in the alarm panel before we place accounts in service. I learned about pace and efficiency. I contributed a lot of my knowledge of computers and alarm panels to make my job successful at ADT."
good,It was a secure place to work. Everything was pretty laid back.
good,"This was a 100% commission job. After a while, the job became too stressful, especially when you are single and relying on a 100% commission-based paycheck."
good,I work in the sales department and presently my income does not meet minum wage standards. So I am looking at second job options. I have gone to school for medical billing and I am still trying to get employment in that field. I am willing to work part time evenings and weekings to get the experience in the patient registrations field. My only problem is no one is willing to train. It appears every place I go wants experience. I can not get the experience if I am not giving the chance to work in the field.
good,Very independent job where pay was 100% commission based. Sales territory for Ft Worth TX was extremey large.
good,This organization taught me to be self-sufficient and manage operations from a remote location to be successful. I relied on my teammembers to fulfill my projects and to ensure they come in on time and under budget.
good,"get to the office and get numbers to call for the day, learned how to manage my time"
good,"Start work at 8 on the road from 8.30, after submitting all all admin work. Learned how to get around Gauteng. I was manged by my team leader but just in the morning but for the rest of the day it was self management, co-workers were fun to work with there were about 20 of us on 1 team. The hardest part of my job was when my appointments were to close to each other it used to clash with my other appointments and my clients should cancel or ask some else."
good,Great fellow employees. benefits and material needed to do the job
good,The most enjoyable part of job is being rewarded for a job well done.
good,I enjoyed working here with numerous people on a daily basis. The pay was nice too.
good,Had an exellent run with ADT and enjoyed working with the people in my office and with the National account managers and the people with the Fed Systems Group.
good,"Its an ok place to work, but company is not willing to hire through company, only contract work."
good,Fair company to work for. Fairly big in size depending on location and at times employees get lost in the shuffle at times. All in all lots of potential for growth.
good,"Great workplace environment, with great training, and support. The capability to make your own sound business decisions within the framework of the Companies policies, and procedures."
good,"Company is always trying to improve processes. Team Activities with focus on fun and encouraging for individual participation. Call Center environment, on the job training, with a good Training Department."
good,"Since my start date I was welcomed by the team and trained for two weeks prior to being able to interact with customers over the phone so I felt fully confident in handing there queries, staff are friendly and helpful and the managers are approachable and make you feel at ease if you have any issues, we each have our own ledgers to work so are managed independently but also our main goal collectively is collecting cash to increase our profit margins after resolving customer disputes over invoices"
good,"Involves a lot of prospecting and leveraging on relationships with builders, electricians, property managers and business owners. There is not alot of monitoring of your day to day (typical in sales), but you are expected to bring in your numbers. The toughest part of the job is that ADT is not the cheapest in the market. so it can  be difficult to sell the same service for more than competition."
good,"I would prospect for new business every day.  The company would provide a few leads per month.  I learned a lot about the business through doing the job.  Management was very lax.  The hardest part of the job at first was figuring out how to develop a sale.  The most enjoyable part was, once I learned, designing a security system for a business."
good,overall great place to work .Don't have much to say . Just don't make 1 mistake .. It might cost you your job....I love the supervisors .I just don't feel they give you enough time to learn all of their processes
good,"Overall a well structured company with clearly defined goals. Management can put certain reps in better territories based on personal preference. Territories change often and it's hard to get used to a new area. Training is excellent."
good,Good flexibility and money is good once you gain momentum with customers. The job offered some great training. A great group to work with as well. They do the best they can with what's given to be successful.
good,"It has been hard to figure out my commission during my time at ADT. Although I am happy with the environment, the management are undertrained in people skills. and the commission needs to be clear for the employee's"
good,"ADT had a very good business and development team.  The analysts where very well versed on the multiple systems used for service. The group managed to get ahead of schedule for web application initiatives.  Organizational changes where made often, most likely due to mergers.  The people were very nice to work with."
good,This is a job whereas you receive compensation for sales installed only. Commission only occupation. You will be driving your own vehicle to all appointments received with mileage reimbursement monthly.
good,"The other sales reps don't help new sales reps. They take new people as a threat. My manager, who left shortly after I did, did not train the reps. We were pretty much on our own. Fortunately, the technicians were great and helpful. The product sells itself, if you're willing to work."
good,"Customer service support, answering calls from Spanish and English speakers from the US and Puerto Rico. The hardest part of the job was the hours. I learned how to manage upset customers."
good,nice place to work was weekly pay. it changed. old but easy operating systems to utilize. Great little perks daily. And great cafe coffe and icemachines
good,I was tasked with cultivating new business within the small business community in Northern Kentucky. I learned a lot from my manager and peers as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with them to secure their businesses while increasing profitability as well.
good,"Sales is a challenging field. the job requires self-generated leads, excellent customer service and relationship building along with quick and innovative thinking. Every month the quotas start over and sales surges are cyclical at times. That can be a challenge since it's commission only. If you're willing to work hard and make it through the first year the earning potential stabilizes"
good,"Ambiente de trabajo dinamico, con grandes retos y excelente compenzacion, capacitacion constante una de las mejores compañias que conozco."
good,"I was placed here for a audit project during a nationwide upgrade."
good,They are very quick to terminate people for the smallest reasons when work is slow but over all I loved working for ADT. The customers were enjoyable to work with and most of the other techs were helpful and always there to lend a hand. Management wasn't always that great but over all I loved the job.
good,Very nice working environment. Flexible hours with great benefits. Management was effective and was ready to help all the time. Money can be made if one possesses great work ethic.
good,"Only a few bad eggs and the new corporate structure is eliminating a lot of the bad eggs.      They are a ""Fire of the Day"" type of culture lacking policy and procedures.   A lot of ""not my job"" people working there."
good,I learned the business a lot about selling from my sales manager and their training programs. They company is very tightly controlled based on being a security company therefore I can't comment on the position specifically.
good,great management they were really helpful when i had a issue or a question very important call center i had enjoyed the process needed to help keep people and the valuables protected
good,"I really enjoyed the 2 years I was with ADT Commercial Security. I handled the existing customer base on a daily basis, reaching out to customers, setting appointments and meeting with the to determine their existing and future needs. Management is very nice to work with, they were very human in their approach. The hardest part of the job is the initial contact and getting the decision maker on the phone. I really enjoyed meeting with my customers, face to face."
good,over all its a good place to work. like all commission only jobs you get what you put in. the team i work for is good. work hard and get paid well.
good,I found the company to be a good company but some of the staff were different and made life interesting but productive.   I believe they serve the community well and should keep up the good work there.
good,It was a great opportunity to have worked at Adt. The best company on professionalism. Just the long hours are straining and one is unable to balance work and private life.
good,Great organization but lacks management aptitude to retain good sales people. The worst training program for new hires. Because of lack of proper product knowledge and training the turn over is very high
good,Sales dropped and so budget cuts across the board. VP came in and leveled the playing field but management refused to follow it.
good,ADT  is overall a good company but it has its good months and bad months the goal is to set two appointments daliy to have a set schedule throughout the week you're out in the field most of the time.
good,"typical day: servicing and installing residental/ small business customers in various areas and territories."
good,Great sales job with plenty of growth opportunities. Amazing sales training program. Hours are somewhat flexible but as in all sales jobs the more work you put in the better the pay is.
good,An industry leader which helps with recognition & trust with some clients.  Typical outside sales job with assigned territory.  Will have some company set appointments.  Not the most competitive as to monthly fees compared to some other providers.
good,"on a typical day at ADT there is mix of calls  from technicians, install, service and sales managers, and mostly customers who are either satisfied or disgruntled. From each of these callers a different outcome. There are endless emails, reporting to be sent, logs to be worked and a host of different things on the business side. flip to the casual or fun side of working at ADT  are incentives contests potlucks and jokes and great friendships that are formed."
good,"Making drinks and serving customers was a lot of fun. "
good,"Good brand to work for. Working hours are flexible. Diversity makes the job enjoyable. I have learned about technology and how it can be utilised and how it can assist the human factor in performing their duties better."
good,"Able to assist customers with their security systems and help the feel safe within their home. Even though unable to work hands on with the customers, still rewarding knowing I was able to help."
good,"There is a nearly impossible quota to meet every month and a lot of office time for an out-of-office sales position. There are also a lot of job requirements that are supposed to generate more sales, but do not (i.e. 50-100 phone calls a day). The benefits are good, but once you are out of your trial period it is a commission-only position."
good,Good people and easy job but not very challenging. Lots of training and helpful people to assist. Wages were not very good and hours could be awful at times.
good,"Over all expressive work environment"
good,"I learned a lot working here, and it definitely pays well. The down side is that the training is poor, and you pretty much have to learn everything on your own. The managers aren't very willing to help, and there are constant changes that don't always work in your favor."
good,"Prior to ADT merger, office environment was very friendly, positive environment. After ADT merger, environment changed and many lay-offs took place. The changes were many and frequent."
good,I really like to work out door and meet new people everyday. also I enjoy working in a team. that's what I like about this job
good,After working for ADT secrity and going door to door. You learn a lot about yourself. And being that it is commission based you really earn what you put out. It also depends on what time of the year it is.
good,"At first, an ideal job.  Had great training and tremendous initial success.  Sale of company led to internal struggling resulting in a company that sold itself again and is still struggling to this day."
good,"Great place to work. I was ranked top perfomer."
good,"A typical day of work requires me going door to door, presenting the future client with affordable and quality insurance, and reassuring them of the positive investment. The worst part of the job is not everyone is as kind as they should be."
good,"Overall this is a great place to work; good benefits; clean and employee oriented. Company provided everything need to do your job."
good,"great training, get an ipad, plus have cell phone and gas alloted. tuff getting more customers lots of cheaper competition."
good,"Commission only pay."
good,Busy Alarms Customer Care desk . Enjoyed Resolving Customer problems and complaints by utilising my excellent knowledge and experience within this industry.
good,"Sale or your out."
good,Era una de las mejores empresas de seguridad pero al día de hoy ya no es lo mismo la calidad de la empresa a bajado
good,"My Hours would be 9-5 but that never happens most of the time I leave at 7 in the afternoon. I learned how to be patient and control high volume of work. I was the manager of the technician and that would have to be the hardest for me. The technician were not reliable, always late, and talk back to me as there manager but I could not fire them I could not say anything because every tech that work there was a family friend of the owner. The most enjoyable would be my paycheck every two weeks it would be the best part of the job"
good,"consistent schedule"
good,i helped techs with their alarm installs via call center. I also checked if tech did work stated and update customers acct and all data entry at ADT.
good,Daily your main goal is to focus on sales and acquire more customers. My objective was to learn the technology and various products so that I may communicate effectively with my clientele. I learned that everyday is not a typical day. There will be various challenges and hurtles to manage all with patience. Most of my co-workers were like family to me. They were very helpful and tried to do the best that they could to assist me. I also did that in return. The best part of my job is meeting and assisting people with their needs. Making sure that I did my part in helping protect their families.
good,generally before the parent company tyco had split off and made adt a stand alone company they where my ideal place to work and I thank them for the experience I had learned.
good,"Twelve hour day if you want to succeed. A great job for young salesperson who does not have anything else to do in life. The home and small business products are the best, along with the sales staff at the location I worked."
good,"Provided customer service. Entered orders and scheduled installation and repair appointments for technicians in the Home Security Department."
good,"ADT a adopté la méthode de gestion structurante Six Sigma visant à l’amélioration des processus de contrôle de qualité et l’efficacité des processus. Cela fait de son organisation un milieu où les processus sont clairs et bien en place. Les individus sont donc plus aptes qu’ailleurs à utiliser des moyens qui permettent de servir la clientèle plus rapidement et plus efficacement qu'ailleurs."
good,"write clients information onto the database,call clients insure the information is correct and corressponds with the system."
good,"I really liked my job and the people. Everyone cared for each other. I would go into work. I opened up my locker and got out my materials for work. I worked in a cubicle with 5 other people. I pulled up the screens I needed. Placed my materials on my desk and began receiving alarms. I made sure I addressed each one. Or people could get hurt(medical alarms), a fire could be really going on, or a home or business could really be robbed."
good,Good company until new management came increase in prices and decrease in service
good,"Warming and welcoming environment with a great work/life balance. Working with different types of people whether it be sales, management, Admin, Warehouse, all types and experiences. ADT developed my Customer Service, and computer skills greatly."
good,"i have learned to be patient to handle pressure, to listen and how to answer wen i have to, i understood what they meant about team work. the management was good, friendly at times. my co-workers were good and supportive. the hardest part of the job... getting the customer to sign. the most enjoyable part was meeting the customers."
good,"sales, long days, meeting once a week, not enough sales training"
good,This company is a great start into the customer service field. They give you great training and benefits. However the environment was very draining and negative. The managers were not approachable and co-workers were very rude. The environment was much like high school and not a positive one.
good,I left from home to do my workorders
good,Sales of security commodities to business owners. Inbound and out bound calls to satisfy the security measures needed to protect their businesses.
good,Descent pay
good,"Buen ambiente, sueldo acorde al sueldo, pagos en fecha acordada."
good,The night before I plan my work day. You are pretty much on your own.
good,"I am currently unemployed, but I am a dedicated worker and good individual. I get along with people, because of my love for them. I am an honest, hardworking, and give a 100%."
good,"There had been so many changes in upper and middle management from 2005 through 2008 and so many changes to the way of doing business and what wad important to the company, it had become not the outstanding company that I had loved to be a part of for the previous 25 years. Morale was down to an all time low, and customer service was suffering as were the employees. My hopes is that is has restored itself to the one time class organization it was."
good,"My day starts at 6am, I gather my leads, review customer requirements, prepare paperwork, and geographical plans for driving."
good,"Job requirements were strict and based strictly on commissions from sales. Strictly Cold Calling. Area of production is depressed economically, far away from home. Calexico and El Centro, CA."
good,"It’s not totally great, but good! management needs to be more flexible and stop being so numbers driven! But isn’t that the same everywhere? It seems that all weekly training meetings are the same. Have a “ worker bee” give the training, it gives everybody the possibility of teaching a class and know sales better."
good,Es buen empleo solo que el producto es un poco dificil de colocar ya que la mayoria de gente no le interesan los isstemas de seguridad
good,"The good is that, it prepares me mentally, for high stress jobs. I take over 200 calls a day, ranging from simple calls, to very intricate calls, that takes a bit more time and focus. The bad is that, there's isn't a ton of room for advancement, and I am someone who would love to hold a leadership position."
good,Work day is busy.  Management is easy to work with.  There are a number of discounts available to employees.  Hardest part of the job trying to keep the everyone happy. Enjoyable part of the job are the people. We try to keep environment light and easy going.  Sometimes customers can be difficult to deal with.
good,"Good place to work. Some customers can be biased towards culture and workers though. Be cautious when going in areas where you are a minority. Also, police may be an issue in rual areas."
good,Good experience as a monitoring agent for a security company for both particular and business. i would have stayed longer at the time if the salary was better. But i enjoyed the experience
good,"He trabajado 11 años en ADT Buenos Aires, Argentina . Me desempeñaba en el sector de Monitoreo , desarrollaba tareas de recepción de llamadas de emergencia brindando servicio y contención al cliente en las emergencias derivadas de la activación de alarma. El clima del sector y en general de la empresa lo describiría como bueno y con mucha flexibilidad en horarios para quienes estudian ."
good,"Es una empresa multinacional, muy buenas prestaciones y buen ambiente de trabajo, falta interés por el desarrollo del personal"
good,wasnt there long enough to form an opinion. if commission and sales are your thing its great but i like steady income was a little to scary for me to call a full time job when accounts werent always promised everyday and it was fully comission when i worked here.
good,"This was a stressful job all the time.  Since it was so competitive, no one really helped new hires learn the business.  The territory was so wide spread, I was never home"
good,"Good people to work with.  Goals are achievable.  Turnover is a problem at the sales level and it takes hard work and energy to meet reasonable goals.  Earnings potential is good but it is 100% commission only, other than a training stipend for a few months.  Their reputation is outstanding and is a highly branded name.  Sales reps however, experience ""inside"" competition from ADT's telephone sales group and their dealer network.  The product is considered high quality but at a premium price, so competition can be an issue.  A rep just has to outwork all of these factors and they will make a nice living."
good,"Customer Relations"
good,ADT is constantly on the move with monthly goals. The introduction to the business Provides so much information that at first may be overwhelming. Once a sales rep has a month or two of experience things will begin to fall into place. Having a resolute attitude will carry a person to see success. Team atmosphere is crucial to a new sales persons success as well as the team suitability.
good,Working independently and working on your own time. Your the supervisor of your own because you earn on commission. Make sure all clients pay so that you get your full commission.
good,ADT is an OK company to work for. But the commission only is hard to deal with at times. Makes a definite paycheck amount difficult. You have the opportunity to make good money if you want to work 9 to 10 hours a day. Hardest part of the job is making your quotas in order to stay employed. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working as Administrative Assistant because it was very diversified, and I learned new skills."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and staff you work with. They will always be the reason you enjoy coming to work. Duties as a Manager are not difficult however ADT relies heavily on its TMs to run and conduct the business on a daily basis.
good,"The only call center I've seen where talk time doesn't matter, but getting it right does.  Talking to technicians is far easier then talking to customers."
good,If you work hard you will be rewarded. Commission only.The company works to get you opportunities. They also have continuous training and good benefits.
good,"A typical day at work mostly would be focusing on generating new clients, strategize with your line manager also ensuring that you are well organised."
good,"Whether receiving calls or taking calls, busy all day. "
good,A typical day of work is by having a sales meeting and moving on to looking for business by cold calling and telemarketing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting small business owners.
good,The job is honestly kinda tough but the payout is worth it. it is both hourly and commission based so as long as you perform well you can control your income which is nice but can also be a downfall depending on the month you are having.
good,I loved working with ADT. They were a great company. I only had an issue with the install manager because at the time he did not cooperate with company policy
good,"Each company was different. I thought ADT was the best operation I ever worked for. ADT was security, the others were less focused on the customer and their safety and happiness, and more about the next customer."
good,For the few of those sales people that really wanted a big pay check it was a huge commitment of time.  The product benefits are easy enough to learn.
good,Sometimes they change just to change.  Money can be good. It takes time to learn the skills to sell well. Be at work on time and work the days you are suppose to and you will be fine. Many people fire themselves because of (compliance) attendance.
good,"The culture and benefits at ADT are great, but the compensation is very poor. The team members make almost the same amount as management. Upper management focuses heavily on team member engagement, but often forgets about mid level management. The company also does the same."
good,"Overall the job was good, just wasn't much opportunity for advancement. It was a competitive company, striving to do better and improve on numbers each quarter and year."
good,"ADT is a good first time collections experience, i enjoy being on the phones interacting with other customers from all over the world. I love my job but the pay is not the best. With the work that's being done regardless of experience or not the pay should be fair."
good,"Great place to work. Great training benefits for all employs and opportunities to progress on as an engineer."
good,The job is great but upper management is not on one accord the right hand does not know what the left had is doing. The benefits they offer are great.
good,I was a female worker in the sales force in Tempe Az. The job was great and then management changed. I was working with a mature man and the new boss was much younger and favored men. I was stuck in a predominately senior area where selling security was a concern but the customer didn’t have money to upgrade. This left me with a lot of sales but not a lot of profit. When i asked for a sales position that opened up closer to my home I was told ok but the position was given to a new employee and their profit margin was much greater. I had no choice but to find a new position.
good,"It was great to learn and to grow within the company. I had a great time in terms of the team, and to develop skills on your own with little to no training when you to make adjustments."
good,"As a field tech, the rewards are many. Although your schedule will be tight you do have a fair amount of independence. My direct supervisor was great. Cared about my well being and supported me when needed. As long as work is getting done there is very little pressure. I found the most difficult part of the job was the amount of travel time between calls was often quite stressful. There is an expectation that all calls will be completed every day and on time, but traffic and geography aren't always in your favor. ADT has recently merged with another company, Protection One. Protection One's management will change the culture at ADT. I do not know whether for better or worse."
good,"As a person who was self-motivated in doing my best whether ion sales or service, ADT was a good company to work for, albeit long hors were required. However, particularly in sales the financial rewards were good if successful, and customer satisfaction was achieved in service by going above and beyond the call of duty."
good,"The training is good. You have to be punctual and be able to handle an occasional stressful situation and realize they monitor and record every call, and you have to handle a minimum amount of calls per hour. They will evaluate your performance a lot, but there are a variety of opportunities within the company. You sit in a small cubicle and sit in front of a monitor when you work in Dispatch or Customer Service. Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,too many people not doing efficient work. managers are very hypocritical a lot of training material mass unprofessionalism and no advancement unless you are favoritism by managers. dog eat dog a lot of issues at the branch
good,residential sales now. It was commercial and residential however since the split it has changed. Advancement was an great path from residential to commercial to core commercial.
good,"Working in the office was pretty much what you'd expect.  It was a great environment with great people."
good,If you are not social afraid to approach people this is not the role for you I enjoyed myself working there it was experiencing the fact to be involved with the outdoors helping people be safe in there home I feel like they could have paid more but overall value good addition to my resume
good,A typical day was staring off in the office pumping up the team to go out and sale. We would then sale for about eight hours on a daily bases and then meet back at the office.
good,"every day is different as i'm out on the road meeting new people in there homes helping them secure there homes and there family's typically ill go in the office in the morning and do my the research for my appointments, then return to the office at the end of the day and submit all my files schedule all my new sales and disposition all my appointments then make about 50 phone calls and set up my appointments for the next days."
good,"Experience is relative to the respective team you're on as well as the manager that you report to. My manager didn't have the greatest people skills, only with people he reported to. He wasn't as personable  with subordinates"
good,It's a Call Center so don't expect anything else.  You sit at a desk and answer the phone so a customer can complain to you for eight hours every single day!!
good,Great opportunities to grow and expand to different aspects of the company. Good benefits and incentives. Lacks communication between departments makes hard to meet goals quickly and efficiently.
good,"Training is pretty informative but kind of lacking necessary information for being on the floor.  Management is supportive, most difficult part of the job is dealing with the lack of professionalism of some of the co-workers,"
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and most efficient.  Between inside and outside personnel, the office staffed just over 300 Team Members. I learned that by being a hard working, caring individual, others trusted they could come to me with personal matters. Management was fair.  With being a branch office in a nationwide corporation, hands were somewhat tied.  The workplace culture was diversified.  Most everyone got along, nothing out of the ordinary comes to mind.  I can't say there really was a hard part to the duties I was assigned. The most enjoyable part of my job was the way in which everyone on the administrative staff worked and helped each other to ""get the job done""."
good,Have to deal with tough customers. Union technicians are lazy. Some managers are not willing to help employees and work with them. Offers 24 hours security. Biggest alarm company in the world.
good,Training was extensive but needed for the job. After training we had supervisor and's leads that helped use through the first couple weeks on the floor. Great company to work for.
good,"É uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, consegui aprender bastante informação na minha área, cresci profissionalmente porem não na área de TI eles não possuíam vaga para efetivar somente para estágios e menor aprendiz."
good,"This job was good. The starting pay was great for the year 2007. We were paid weekly. Insurance was great. Continous training to keep up to date, team building meetings were nice. The managers were supportive of you daily goals and helped out when needed. I would go back to work for this company if the opportunity arose. I was layed off back in 2009 when the recession was going on. Which is what prompted me to go to school."
good,Not a lot of real advancement within the company. Plenty of overtime and mandatory overtime. Great place to get your feet wet as far as work experience and flex room with availability. Company is very unorganized with programming for employees and lack of knowledge on troubleshooting products sold. Very easy job as long as you are on time.  Great workplace culture. currently growing company.
good,"Very great company to work for, only no benefits for the employees. High energy culture that definitely motivated everyone to produce more. Really grateful for the experience and wisdom obtained through extensive research."
good,"Sold security systems including Burglar, Fire, Access Ctrl, and CCTV to large commercial account base.  Developed presentations and quotes for new and existing customers. Participated in expos and road shows. Worked with integration team to develop security solutions."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a morning call with your team manager to go over what you would be doing for the day.  I learned to manage my time efficiently and to be proactive at all times with little to no supervision.  I also learned to supervise installers. Management was great, however I wish that they would spend a little more time with their new employees to show them ""the ropes"" of the business.  The hardest part of the job is to make sure that the job that you sell actually gets installed with no problems.  This company has a lot of installs that never go through because the installers are not properly trained to do the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with customers and the feeling of accomplishment from selling a job."
good,Fortune 500 company. Several opportunities for advancement. It seemed that with the company beng as big as it is that some local issues can be hidden from the greater establishment by local upper management.
good,"Company was bought out by Staples. Had a good manager I got laid off. Pay and benefits were good. Company did good things for the employees ie some free lunches, take you child to work day, etc."
good,"Answering Incoming Calls, Meeting People And Working In A Team Environment Is Phone. Learning And Adapting Is Also Fun, I Love New Things And New Ideas"
good,The North America's largest electronic security services company. Provides numerous benefits to employee. I have been given the customer care and support training that i enjoyed the most. Uses multiple techniques to lean and enjoy.
good,"ADT was a great company at the time I was employed there.  The pay and benefit package then was among the best.  It offered great balance between work and personal life and the management team was top notch,though I cannot attest to growth opportunities within the company, I would enjoy employment with this company again."
good,co-workers and direct management are good.  Upper level not as good.  Job has become micro-managed and turned into numbers.  Not all about the customer anymore.
good,"I would notify customers of alarms burglary, fire, to  a low battery,I would notify police if need or the fire department."
good,"Good attitude, excellent coworker, learning fast, optimist. Work under pressure. Just you can..... ...................................."
good,have a meeting take calls for customers interested in getting a security system in their home or place of business and learn as much as i can about our product
good,"Um dia de trabalho, maior parte tranquilo."
good,New world tech but old school management. There is not a realistic thought about goals for a forecast. Upper management not in tune with the changing atmosphere in the security industry
good,I rather not say a thing. I would like other to experience themselves so they can review it. I rather leave in a positive note.
good,"At ADT Security LLC I am responsible to schedule my self generated appointments,run company set appointments, and close over 50%. I learned the customer is directly responsible for both my success and the market share growth of ADT. I work with a very enjoyable group of co-workers who help each other to benefit one and another. Our management are very accessible, and team oriented."
good,"Up to the last year or so its been pretty tolerable. However the management doesn't obviously care about the employees in respect to lunch or breaks any longer and is constantly threatening to apply corrective action if schedules are not met. Its like any other company the bottom line profit comes before the employee, and the attitude of replacement is more prevalent than keeping those that have been there happy."
good,Management was not well informed how to assist when needed.  Lots of misinformation pass along.  Management lost their pride.  Did not care about the importance of the job
good,"Nationally recognized company. "
good,"Worked there for almost a year, it was stressful, time consuming and mismanaged which is why I left to pursue my career elsewhere"
good,"IT was all door to door, if you do something else besides that it is wonderful! I did door to door throughout virginia/maryland/west virginia and I honestly didn't like the people we visited. I mean of course we were just knocking on doors but they weren't the friendliest people on earth. MY co workers were wonderful people who had a drive to make money, I can't say I had the same mentality but they were awesome. I honestly miss them sometimes because they were wonderful people, always positive no matter what."
good,"As a customer service specialist for ADT, I tracked security surveillance of over 10,000 residential and commercial accounts every day. Upon receipt of a distress signal, I immediately called the site to verify the safety of the occupants by requesting a predetermined code word. If there was no answer or I received an incorrect code word the local police department and/or fire department was notified immediately. Also, I assisted clients with troubleshooting of malfunctioning alarm systems. If troubleshooting was unsuccessful I scheduled for an appointment for on-site field service technicians to repair or replace the alarm system. The most difficult part of the job was learning to troubleshoot alarm systems as there were various different types. However, I had very patient and encouraging managers and co-workers with years of experience to support me through my training. Each day after work, I felt like I played an important role in keeping people safe. I believe that was the most enjoyable part of working for ADT."
good,"- most of typical days its wher by there is a new product which need to advartised distributed to many of stores withing a certian given piriod of time that makes us to work under pressure."
good,Giving citizens a peace of mind is very rewarding. Flexible schedule but due to leads declining and commissions changing in a negative manner is challenging.
good,"I was hired to replace all the wireless radios that was 2G to 3g in the Dallas Area for 4g depended the type of radio I was working on. Worked out of my car and paid my own maintenance and insurance."
good,"On a good day you find out that you saved a life, or aided a customer w/ a technical over the phone w/out having to a tech to the home costing hundreds of dollars."
good,just before I left there was a change in ownership and changes made. changes that didn't make a lot of sense and got rid of a lot of people
good,The staff care about what they do- save lives. Still a young company that is moving into maturity.  World class leader in the industry.
good,Learned a lot more about customer service. Learned a tad bit more about team work and being a team player. The most enjoyable part about my job were the customers
good,my work day was very busy i used to see at least 3 clients a day.My co workers were friendly.It was difficult at times when appointments could not be secured.The most enjoyable part was whjen i signed a client it boosts your morale and confidence
good,ADT great company provides outstanding quality equipment and service but management is 100% focused on numbers.  Outstanding customer service is more then numbers.
good,Everything good. We support and work very well together. we help each other to achieves the company goal.
good,"My typical day at work is always busy, I learn every day and work well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is when I have to meet my deadline and dont want to be disturbed. I always meet my deadline, I work well under pressure and am the best in my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job is where I am always busy and always have something else to do. I always have a productive day and enjoy in what I do which includes customer services and my telephone ettique."
good,Great place to work. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience with ADT. Learned many different things from how they run their business.
good,"The direct managment is good and will bend over backwards when a team member needs help in personal and professional matters. Too much emphasis put on quantity not enough emphasis put on quality given to interior customers(techs in the field) or exterior customers. You can be lost in the suffle very easily here if your not careful. All in all I did enjoy working for ADT, but it is time to move on to a career that I can actually have my excellent customer service be of use and my data entry skills be helpful to me and the company I work for."
good,"My typical day is not a typical day at the office. My skills and expertise are not only dealing with technology and home security systems. I have to wear many hats. In summary, I am my own administrator, a listener, consultant, quick problem solver, vendor consultant, budget manager, and project planner."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in."
good,"I have learned a lot about data entry while working for this company, they don't require a lot but expect top performers to ensure that the job is done correctly. I like that the company holds you accountable but is there to help you along the way."
good,"Have been working for ADT Security since 2009. Has been a great company to work for, but has been going through so many changes recently where the valued sales reps are no longer being treated fairly.  Also, no room for advancement."
good,Spent most of the day navigating from one job to the next. Management was not overbearing and I was close with many of my co-workers. Work was not overly complex and was nice learn all the different areas of the city and outlying towns.
good,"Overall great experience working for ADT. Started off in the field as a sales rep and moved into management. This job requires a self-discipline, organization and strong time management skills. Great training!"
good,"Received incoming phone calls about customer's alarm systems. "
good,"management and staff are as friendly and easy to get along with as close friends. General work day including driving to randoms homes and giving them piece of mind by securing there loved ones and possessions with a security system. crawling in crawlspaces and attics were not the ideal work conditions but manageable. the company ""restructured"" after stocks suffered a substantial drop, in turn decided installers were getting paid to much there by changing the pay scale and raising price of insurance lowering the payout."
good,"log on to system, take all inbound calls from current customers asking general customer service question, as well as new customers looking to install a new home security service"
good,"on a slow day we are required to follow up on customer's alarm make sure they are reminded to change the batteries for smoke alarms, medical alarms. and as usual they don't like being called but it is our job that we follow up in case of a fire or injury for the elderly and burglars and we always delivering exceptional service "
good,"My typical day consisted of answering calls in regards to the ADT alarm systems. I would technically assist customers with their alarm problems, and after exhausting every technique to fix alarms over the phone I would have to setup a technician to go to the customers' homes and fix the issue. Also updated limited information on accounts. I learned to work in a fast paced environment and deal with upset customers. I believe the management was great as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers and trying to be quick with each customer while completely fulfilling their needs. Also, because of the high demand for call center representatives, there is strict attendance policies. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people out who are in need."
good,good people to work for able to learn new selling techniques
good,"good job good pay"
good,"Extremely fast paced work environment. Punctuality is a must. Points for being late, tardy, or absent. Incoming calls are graded by time and quality. Point system almost impossible to keep up in order to get bonuses."
good,very clean and nice enviroment loved the staff and the work hours.
good,"Room to make a lot of money, management not at its best, in sales a lot of competition!"
good,"Taught new sales techniques on a daily basis, very helpful management personnel answered all questions and concerns co-workers were very competitive. Hardest part was the door-to-door sales most enjoyable part was getting sales."
good,"Excelente , tengo la mejor impresion , me gustaria trabajar nuevamente para ellos , pero esta vez en forma directa"
good,I work with a great group of people who I will miss when we get made redundant. During my time here I have built up some fantastic relationships with the customers whose accounts I have been looking after. This has helped to resolve invoice/service queries in order for prompt payment.
good,This was a commission only position so the better you were at your job also being fast with quality work you made more money in the end.
good,Continues focus on achieving numbers when sometimes people are forgotten. Values is one of the most important things I learned here because this is something that most people that work here value. Being objective is one of the hardes part of this job being able to identify when someone is telling the truth or not. I enjoyed the people.
good,"it is very busy and challenging but i do everything to make sure that i maintain the company's standard."
good,"Typical day, consists of sales coordination, project coordination, keeping the customer happy."
good,"ADT has a name that everyone recognizes. With their technology, families and businesses are protected."
good,log in to the systems and take incoming calls from customers. I've learned a lot about customer service and being a sales representative and how to make sure that the customer gets the best service. I never had never had any problems with management i alwyas have done my work and followed company policies. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with the stats every month especially if you are having a slow month in sales.
good,Aprendi todos los campos de mi profesión.
good,Co-workers can be a little uptight sometimes because it was a very stressful job. Working technical support you learn ALOT about security systems and how they work.
good,Loved helping any company in a emergency within the 24hrs 7days a week.
good,"Sold security, burglar, hold up, CCTV, Access Control to both small business and commercial in S Florida."
good,"ADT was a great place to work. The only reason I left was for more money. However, I have since realized that money is not always everything. ADT had great core values, the management was great as well as the staff."
good,Era muy gratificante.Aprendi muchisimo y te enseñaban mucho con capacitacion . Era al nivel de la empresa. Muy compañeros era un grupo de trabajo .Sin descanso y desgastante.La experiencia y la calidad del grupo de trabajo.
good,"I honed my inter-personal skills, challenged my self from a knowledge point of view. There was no telling what to expect in that some days were a typical 9 to 5 days, others we had to report earlier and leaver later that our normal hours of work. In some instances we had to work on weekends outside the Office environment. I cannot say that there was a difficult part about the job, except to say it required someone who can adapt to various work situations. The most enjoyable part was the combination of an Office environment and an external (outside office) environment."
good,Great for self starter and for autonomy. Strong training and development. A very competitive sales environment.
good,"Empresa, con buenas prestaciones, pero que no tiene horarios definidos ni diferencia la vida personal a la laboral."
good,Call center and door to door activities. Depending on manager a lot of freedom. A little cut-throat at times.
good,"Daily duties include, Project managed over 100 commercial installations, including banks, county courts, US marshals office, and big business."
good,"A typical day at work was very basic, with a computer, head set and phone (set up for in and out bound calls, however, depending on the weather, wind or simply just that newly installed system, we could be hit with several alarms for long periods of time. I walked away from ADT learning yet another job skill coupled with customer service skills. I really enjoyed the management team, structure and set up and I am glad I had the opportunity to work with all three shift managers. I got along well with my coworkers and enjoyed working all that overtime just as much as they did. The hardest part of the job was during bad weather, when alarms are going crazy and everyone is having to dispatch on false alarms, unsure if its a false alarm or not. The most enjoyable part of the job was working for such great people like our Sr. Huamn Resources Generalist and the Director of the the Dallas call center during my time of employment."
good,"Very rewarding place to work. High energy, fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction"
good,interesting how the alarm business work
good,"In my opinion it was a great place to work, great benefits, and friendly people to work with. The only thing is the schedules arent always the best, if youre looking for a 9-5 type job"
good,"A great company to work for with fabulous benefits. If you're a single person, in college and have no children then you can make some pretty good money but don't look for advancement to be easy. Getting off the customer service floor is hard and thankless. The rules were always constantly changing and they frown on absenteeism even in the slightest and with legitimate reasons."
good,"As a fomrer employee of ADT I regret leaving the company.At the the time of my departure,the future of the local branch did not seem healthy for my career. I now am aware of the opportunities that ADT can provide outside of the local office branch. I know the present economy is enduring for everybody, including myself.Again I regret leaving ADT."
good,Fun job where I interacted with people all day. I made my own hours and was paid on how many deals I made.
good,"ADT is a impressive company to work for. They truely spend alot of time and reasources to give all employees the best chance possible to succeed. The job is very rewarding but long hours. Many days are on the road, door to door, and cold calling. Be prepaired to work long hours."
good,This was a good job for entry level customer service rep. to get experience. If you are more established this place my remind of a big high school.
good,As a mentioned my time was short due to downzing. The branch I worked from did seem disfunctional. Besides that I feel if I had stayed the oppurtunities would have been endless.
good,"I have been with ADT for several years and many processes have changed over the years, but this company actually cares about its management team and technicians."

The hardest part of the job just as usual with sales is the leads generation and lots of drive. other than that its fun and really enjoyable job and workplace as well.
good,"Every day you had to keep a buffer of alarms cleared and move at a fast pace while also providing excellent customer service. I unfortunately got sick and missed too much work and resulted in my getting fired. Otherwise, I would have stayed there. Supervisors had very little pull because it was a corporate run business."
good,"Fast paced, high stress. Fun workplace environment, approachable managers, good training, good comradery between employees. I've learned to be more organized."
good,"Overall ADT is a good place to work.  Your manager makes a huge difference regarding your experience there.  Some of the managers are very encouraging and some are absolutely horrors.  The IT department would use some help in resolving things a lot faster.  There is good variety of people there and they are handicapp accessible.  The rules can be somewhat intimidating due to the fact that you only get 3 breaks a day."
good,"Your call, but highly recommend you have a Plan B in place! Seriously sought you'll survive there financially! Huge turnover and employee churn in this position!"
good,"I enjoy working at ADT , but there are certain opportunities that does not become available. I would love to be able to move up in a company and be able to implement some of my own ideas."
good,The training for the call center position was excellent. The position was stressful. I think that roving mentors would have been an excellent idea instead of very little support on the floor.
good,"I enjoyed other employees. My manager and didn't see eye to eye upper management were good at what they did and were dedicated. I spent 18 years in electronic  security, 12 of which included high end technology. I Was limited in regards to technology with ADT."

good,Was given the opportunity to learn new skills from other employees that I am able to take with me and apply to my own future employment elsewhere.  I am grateful for the opportunity I had to work and learn at ADT.
good,ADT definitely equips their new hires with detailed training and proper resources to be successful in the position. They have a relaxed business casual dress code and they have a lot of amenities for their employees from nap rooms to gyms and even a lactation room for mothers. They set aside time weekly for each team to meat and discuss goals and ways to improve and develop not only each individual on the team but the whole team as well.
good,"Sales and marketing of physical and hardware security products"
good,Very good lead flow provided by the company. excellent customer base that allows sales representatives to be extremely productive. Management did have a tendency to play favorites not based on productivity.
good,"Management was awesome"
good,"Working at ADT required high motivation, attention to detail and creativity in pursuing ADT goals, deadlines and projects. Very demanding, serious corporate structure and culture, no errors allowed."
good,I enjoyed my time working at ADT. I gained a lot of skills and experience with this company. They really helped with building my customer service skills more.
good,"You must be able to quickly learn job multiple processes, and have knowledge on how to get wires, from point A to B without exposing them in the open. Management constantly pushes you to work hard and fast, so you must be able to work quickly and efficiently to please the bosses. The hardest part of the job is having to sell $600 of extra equipment a month. The most enjoyable part is knowing that you've pleased the customers, and made their business/residence secure from burglars."
good,"calling customers when alarm goes off, calling authorities trouble shooting taking payment over phone from customer and sending tech out.the hardest part of job is having patience when it comes to the customer especially when they are upset."
good,"Great company and management is a greater help ,the have plenty of overtime if you need it."
good,"Though the international concern spent 100's of millions USD on all versions of media, NYC leads never filtered down; especially small to medium commercial businesses. Thus, besides learning security products and implementation, I had to teach myself how to find customers in the zip codes assigned. Leading to my ""capturing"" construction permit data and sifting through to 10's of potential opportunities for surveillance and access control implementations. Additionally, had to bootstrap installation department to follow my lead on IP products and IP network convergences."
good,"Decent Job Culture.  Good place to work, but I was stuck during a company split from ADT to Tyco and there was much disorganization at that time.  Good HR, though, and they will work with you through getting situated."
good,"Great challenging work environment, good project and PMO structure. "
good,"Daily interactions with customers, managers and co-workers"
good,Clock in on time and have to be on the phone for required amount of time. Regular breaks and Lunches. Management was reasonable and approachable. Workplace culture was great.The hardest part was dealing with upset customers that didn't want to get off the phone until someone arrive at the location. All in all you make sue your customer is satisfied. The most enjoyable is helping customer and Technicans get thru their day.
good,I worked there for over 10 years and felt that I was valued at times and other times not. But I felt like I was given freedom to do my job and do it well. There are many areas where you can improve in your job and they have many spaces for talented people to fill. The hardest part of the job is that I worked in the sales center and its all about the numbers.  Management is hit or miss. Some really good managers and some difficult ones. I learned to be upfront and devoted to making a plan work.
good,I enjoyed my employment at ADT.  There was room for advancement and it was a great atmosphere.  Training was very informative and I felt very comfortable going on to the floor
good,I enjoy it because you get to go into people's homes and interact with them and develop a security plan that best suits their home and family. It's long hours and a lot of driving but it's worth while.

good,"I was the lead residential installer. Drove all over Nevada. Got paid on commissions, the more the installed, the more I got paid. I decided how many installs I wanted to do for the day / week."
good,ADT has a great environment for a workplace.  People are highly competitive however there is no advancement or growth for what I do in the company in my opinion.
good,We called customer when alarms went off. We would call police if needed and helped customer with alarms issues. Notified needed authorities. Helped people need to having alarms systems
good,It is a good place to work.  The company lets you decided your work hours and your evaluation is done by the achievement of results.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,I enjoyed giving the sales presentations in clients homes. This was also a job with minimal supervision. ADT is a well recognized company and overall i had a positive experience working for them.
good,"Great people to work with.  It was an upbeat and fun environment, with music and food from time to time.  Enjoyed working with others in the office and the dress code was very casual.  If time off was needed, the supervisor was to be contacted ahead, which was fair, and the leads were provided from the autodialer and updated on a weekly basis."
good,"This job was great, and the working environment was very comfortable.  After 5 years though I just felt like there was no place for advancement.  I also decided I would like to go back to College."
good,"Its a good place to work for, many people stay here for years but I personally would not consider this place for a long term carrer. Not making any difference in world with this job."
good,"i grow at ADT Security into higher position which was good, ended in Nation Key Accounts working with Nation companies such as African Bank, and the whole group they had under them( Ellerines, Bears ) furniture stores, which we did the alarms and monitoring for."
good,"The company is good to work for and they promote from within, however  was tough in my area because of internal competition which sometimes is not very healthy, overall it is a good company."
good,This job offers positive reinforcement top there sales representative. You feel acknowledged and worthy. This job offers you the advantage of wanting accomplish something very team oriented
good,"report daily to customers home to assist the with problems they have with alarm system. which includes troubleshooting, wiring, testing and change batteries as needed"
good,"Professional work environment. Training needs to be improved, does not get you ready for the actual floor. Expectations are not clear. Some of the managers are at work less than the actual agents."
good,"I enjoyed the work as far as the product knowledge, but management from my supervisor was a bit of harassment/stressful!  I was not pleased with the company's way of promoting from within!"
good,"Door to door sale rep,speaking with live people,helping prevent break in and alert for fire.traveling to different neighborhood or county providing services."
good,It's a call center.  People dress anyway they feel.  Mangement is very supportive. Culture is not good.  Hardest part of job is their pulse system.  I enjoy when I leave.
good,"The company was a good company overall, which lacked in quality trained field supervision security professionals to lead the field operations section of the security operation."
good,"Learned the processes of the alarm business. A typical day at work includes helping customers and technicians with numerous queries, liaise with control room."

good,"I have work for ADT for 3years now & I must say it is a great company to work for."
good,"This a job that will really make you work for you dollar, if thats something that doesnt scare you go for it! I was successful, so why cant anyone else be. After working with the company for 2 years, straight out of college, it taught me about being your own boss and motivating yourself to secure your own pay check. The position enables you to have extreme flexibility with your schedule. The company will train you but make it your mission to know your product this way you can communicate the pro and cons much more comfortably. The security industry does have a lot of hands in the pot but ADT is and always will be the face of the security industry ."
good,"Aprendí el manejo de dispositivos para un sistema de alarma, como funcionan y cuales son sus alternativas de colocación, ademas de negociar con los clientes. El ambiente laboral era bastante tranquilo. El comedor es muy bueno. Lo que no me gusto es que no había flexibilidad de horario"
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working for ADT. We had to leave Utah because of health reasons with my wife. So is OK now. Did more resales sales than any previous representative for ADT. Made 200 to 300 calls week contacting prospects.
good,"J'ai travailler pres de 1 ans,pour ADT et j'ai adoré mon travaille.Si j'aurais la chance de travailler pour eux,je n'hésiterais pas."
good,"Solid company leader in the alarm industry and strong brand recognition. Great working environment more like independent contractors, good product to sale protecting home owners and businesses."
good,"I go in at 7am pick up paper works and equipments then leave for the jobs. I would work like 6 days a week. I like it until we got a new install manager, our old got promoted. The new manager only want to work with a certain group of people. So he clean house, it took him a while to get to me."
good,"I used to love working for this company.  That was BEFORE the hidden talks about the merger that took place back in 2016.  Before, everyone was more like family.  Benefits were spectacular and there was room for growth at one point."
good,"Fast paced environment but overall I enjoyed my job. Monitoring alarms, answering calls and dispatching in a timely fashion."
good,"Lots of driving, getting to meet customers. Do not get to work with other employees. Hardest part of job travel, and not allowed to drink water inside vehicle."
good,Work day included running co appts. and self generated leads.  Learned how to configure alarm systems.  Management was fine but went long periods without managers.  Great and professional co-workers. Self generating leads by door knocking was difficult.  Favorite part of job was closing a large amount of sales.
good,"A typical day for me can start as early as 7am it may involve an early appointment or a strategy meeting at the office im either attending or hosting, As a team we go over what we may have experienced out in the field or new product and even new promotion that can be used as a tool for closing deals, my co-workers play a vital roll in this exercise, it is essential to be a good listener, contacting vendors, odering parts, scheduling appointments, making calls to potential customers, and closing as many deals as possible, the hardest part of my job is when i am unable to help someone so that would make the enjoyable part of my joy the fact that i can"
good,"Excelente empresa, da espacios, estabilidad laboral, constante capacitacion y excelente  clima  laboral."
good,A typical day at this position I found to be very memorable as I was overseeing the scheduling and arranging of Security Professionals at various site.
good,"great pay , great insurance"
good,A true challenge industry. Multifaceted job that keeps you constantly learning. If you like being the best you can be this is the job for you.
good,ADT has great benefits to offer their employees. And it is awesome work life balance. Nice people but is a revolving door of Sales Representatives. Overall fun company.
good,ADT has an amazing culture. They are very careful on the people they decide to bring on board. This might not be the best time to work for the company but definitely a great place to create a career.
good,"ADTP est une association de travailleurs handicapés qui réalise des activités de sous-traitance industrielle pour les grandes entreprises de Haute-Savoie en majorité mais aussi pour la Suisse."
good,Needs more HR involvement but overall great place to work. Scheduling was flexible. Most enjoyable part about job was advancement opportunities.
good,"Good pay and benefits, low stress, great support from direct management and upper management.  Great training and time to acclimate to job with on the job training after classroom training.  I really love the on the job training as there were always support staff within arms reach to answer any questions that come up."
good,they are a good company who try to help their staff succeed at what they are doing. they support their staff to make sure they are doing the best they can.
good,Worked there for over 16 years and was laid off with 2 weeks notice.  But while I was there - for at least the first 14 years - loved my job and the people I worked with.
good,"I love my co - workers and management team. Relax faxt pay, To much work and little pay. Bonus changes constantly. So many systems to work from with no advancemnt in pay"
good,"At ADT things are constantly changing so consistency is hard to find especially with management. Good benefits, opportunities to volunteer, and wellness rewards."
good,I woked through a third party and they suddenly decided to end their contract abruptly. The best part was it was a postion from home and I was able to make my own schedule.
good,Coordination of sales and delivery of home security systems to population of southern california to fulfill the needs of home owners and businesses.
good,The Managing Director that I worked for was a pleasant and fair person.  There were very difficult days but together we managed to get through every obstacle.
good,"Compania de cutura americana, con las flexibilidades que puede otorgar con home office, dia por cumpleanos, grandes beneficios a empleados y cultura organizacional amigable para el cliente interno."
good,It is a fast paced work place dress is casual but it gets repetitive after awhile and kind of boring but their are plenty of advancement opportunities
good,"Customer always had problems that needed to be solved, so my problem solving skills were truly tested. Mgr. didn't really listen to suggestions in team meetings. Made great friends from coworkers."
good,"Learned a great deal in my first year"
good,"It's always good to save lives, and keep people safe, but that is such a small portion of the job, and we get little to no feedback as far as how actual events turn out. The best and worst part of the job is being part of a union -- good pay and benefits, but very political."
good,"ADT is a fast paced Call Center Enviornment. They have good benefits. Management works really hard to keep you aware of changes to Policy and Procedure."
good,"ADT is a great company to work for. For the most part your day consists of answering inbound calls and answering billing and general customer service questions for customers. Management for the most part is very helpful and willing to assist. The compensation is good for the work that you're doing, however there are no more bonus opportunities within the billing department. Numbers are important but the biggest definitely being attendance and adhering to your schedule,"
good,"Employees are expected to be self motivated to make upwards of 200 cold/warm call/week and to knock on about 100 doors.  New sales reps get company lead flows based upon their gross close rate(GCR).  But, self-generated sales will get more commission.  Job is a commission only job.  Some holes in vacation pay  Job is 6 days a week.  Local management is nice, but you have several departments that you need to go through to make sure your customers are taken care of, so you are at their mercy to get good referrals.  The insurance isn't that great and it's based on the premiums are structured on your reaching fairly lofty projected sales goals.  Bonus kickers usually are only made if you have a killer month.  You are expected to double check every job as it pays out so you get the right amount of $, and sometimes payment can take up to 3 weeks after the job is installed.  Make sure you have a reliable car, as you will put on a crazy amount of miles."
good,"Easy to manage job. Opportunities to move up. Management very helpful, co workers are generally very nice. Hardest part is the repetitive nature of it being a call center. Most enjoyable part is the fact that the training goes well and the job is easy to reach their goals."
good,"I liked the company. They need to revise the compensation plan for residential resale reps, however. No base salary and no leads makes it terribly difficult to get started. In every other position, as far as I know, there is a base salary available and/or company set appts."
good,"I've been there for 4yrs. Great room for advancement, but really big on attendance and everything is about numbers, so stats are monitored very closely."
good,"A typical work day would be starting at 10.am Sharp where I would raise and impulse in my team as I was a team leader and get people excited for the day and practice saying the pitch and teaching sales techniques in order to close the deal. I would also be monitoring sales activities and proactively taking necessary action to re-direct efforts as needed. We would then go out onto the field to explain competitively priced service plans to customers and engage strangers in conversation by going door to door and by speaking to 100 people that day. I would be planning and scheduling the roots for my team and convincing people of the benefits from certain products or services. I would be developing a rapport with customers and asking potential customers questions to ascertain their potential needs and finally processing payments and filling in forms."
good,"Productive place to work."
good,"C'est un travail très agréable et accessible. il y a un esprit d’équipe "
good,"Proud to promote ADT brand and solutions"
good,Busy. Ever changing. There is a lack of communication in policy changes. Laid back work place for 2nd shift employees. Work most holidays with pay. Wish there was more Rewards and Recognition. Room for growth and advancement.
good,"Empresa com bastante volume de informação e alto senso de urgência;"
good,The company is growing rapidly and it appears that growth could be possible if new positions are created.
good,Your typical workday is spent more than 99 percent sitting in place and answering phone calls. Most phone calls are not happy as something is not working with their system and some are genuine emergencies. Over all it is a positive environment and most of the management cares about their team and helps out how they can.
good,"It was great, training was awesome, environment was good, fast paced workplace."
good,"For me, the most enjoyable part of this job is being able to listen to music or podcasts while I work. This practice makes me more productive and keeps most of the typical office drama to a minimum."
good,Tiene mucho por mejorar y por cambiar la cultura del facilismo.
good,"Calling on Hospitals Senior living Facilities, and retirement communities. Public speaking to churches and other organizations in various communities."
good,"As a collector, I contacted customers about delinquent accounts with the primary objective to secure payment in full or a satisfactory payment arrangement. I really liked that the company recognized employees who exceed the minimum required quotas. I consistently received monthly bonuses and gift cards, a beach chair, a one week fantasy schedule coupons (where I chose my schedule for that week), extra 15 minute break coupons, to use when I wanted to. That was really nice, they also had a system where you earn a happy face sticker base on various stats. Once you have earned enough stickers to fill up a card, you convert that card into $10 (play money) that can be used to buy all sorts of things from a cart that came around daily. Being a collector at ADT is not hard, you have to stay focused when you're on the phone and of course get the money/payment."
good,"Start the day off with a motivational speech."
good,Enjoyed my responsibilities.  Co-workers were easy to get along with.
good,Management is very nice and down to earth. Treat staff like equals. A lot of the staff have been there long term.
good,"ADT offers many benefits needed in today's life style. "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to manage a team of supervisors and the call center floor. I learned a lot while working at ADT, had some great co-workes. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the morale of the employee's and the most enjoyable were the people."
good,being able to locate the parts for the techicans so that they can deliver the service to our customers
good,"-Every day I train and develop new reps with their pitch, techniques on getting inside houses, present a walk-through, how to build report and value in the product, close the sale, and do paperwork. I am responsible for taking a crew out in the field that would consist of 4 or more reps. We all knock doors including myself. If one of my new reps gets into a house they will call me and I will come in and show them how to do a walk-through and close out the sale and will continue to do so until they can do it all on their own. I would relocate us to different areas throughout the day. I work Mon-Sat 11am-8pm."
good,"This position was great. I moved boxes, sorted files, labeled folders and researched for names and dates. The boxes themselves were organized by numerical and alphabetical order. I learned that a good strategy and knowing what is ahead in a job will save a lot of stress and free up complications. My co-worker was the best! She was always willing to do her part to help and get to know me. The hardest part was when we would have nothing to do due to a lack of files or a locked room. Fortunately there was always labeling or checking the sorting of the files and boxes."
good,"Selling home security system to residential customers door to door. My day involved making cold calls, warm calls and door to door sales. Going to the customers home and assessing their security. Selling upgrades to existing systems and primarily signing up new customers. Management was really great. Easy to talk to and helped with whatever you needed. We didn't see our co-workers too often as we were usually out in the field. When we did meet up everyone seemed like very nice and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was the territory was too big. Some days it took me 2 hours to get from one appointment to the next and you are not always given accurate info on preset appointments. The most enjoyable part was getting to spend more time with the family. You control your entire schedule so everything is up to you."
good,This company was a very big learn experience.Customer service  and technical support where our main goals so most of my experiences with problem solving and handling upset customer comes from this job exspirence
good,"Management was very flexible for Employee work/life balance."
good,"It won't be far off if you read my Tyco review. I was more responsible for field and product issues in my early stages of this position and that progressed to finding new product to replace 'old' product and/or to source products to provide solutions to Customers, which included Sales, Service and Installation teams. This is where reviewing new products came in and in preparing reports for pros/cons etc... Still my focus was on Customer satisfaction, providing timely solutions, products, problem solving etc ... and of course staying the course, the ""whatever it takes to get the job done approach"". we were extremely busy. Great people to work with over the years and although I worked independently on many projects during my years, many occassion involved teamwork, and those I always enjoyed and looked forward to. A great opportunity to share ideas and thoughts with other associates."
good,"A typical day consisted of calling on set up accounts as well as cold calling on our own. I learned a lot of security solutions from burglar alarms to security systems. The management was very helpful and driven, as well as my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was calling on customers and presenting the product."
good,"I spent most of my day on the phone helping technicians verify the system they have installed works correctly, I also registered radio, troubleshoot when things didn't work. Verify data on account was accurate. I also was a part of projects to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our department."
good,"La empresa tiene una situacion estable, pero la posibilidad de promocionar es practicamente nula, hay cursos internos en los que amplias conocimientos, un ambiente de trabajo agradable y muchas facilidades para desempeñar el puesto de trabajo"
good,ADT is a great place to grow and learn how to sell face to face with small business.
good,My time at ADT has led me to believe that it is a great company to work for. A typical day at work would be to log into the computer system and log into the phone system and sign into all databases to be utilized so that customer orders can be processed and paperwork can be verified and audited. There would be monthly meetings regarding team production and employee reviews. The management could have been better and my co-workers were excellent. The hardest part of the job was to meet the demands of improving production on a daily basis and towards the end of each month. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was helping out my other co-workers. 
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting the sales reps and my manager, with whatever task needed to be done. I had look up appts. and email to reps, making flyers and coupons, and do mailings."
good,on a typical day i would take roughly 200 calls from sso offices and book 200 installs per day for residential and small business
good,"My job is to sell security solutions to small business clientele. A typical day consists of cold calling on the phones, cold calling door to door, looking for opportunities to create appointments to generate a sale."
good,A typical day is talking to technicians and activating/deactivating customers alarm systems.
good,"I enjoy working for the company, but the working can be challenging at times. For the most part the company does givie you the skill to deal with sistuations"
good,i was not fluent in speaking but after work with adt learnt a lot about communication with different people and great benefits of working with adt armouguard
good,I enjoyed working at Adt I have no complaints. I was a customer service rep. My duties was billing and retention.
good,Filled with amazing people who are extremely welcoming and enthusiastic. A typical day was going to work everyday surrounded by very positive people who just wanted to have fun and work hard together. My coworkers were there 13+ years this company once you go in its difficult to come out only because it pays well and the people are most enjoyable
good,"Even hours with all one could expect from any employer. Had learned much more about computers, geographical locations, data entry, various forms of clerical tasks, along with many other items. The management was generally fair and understanding, leadership was intact and top rate. Co workers were diverse and basically easy to get along, though we were all human and had some basic conflicts, but those had been resolved generally. The hardest part of the job was getting into either technical issues that I was not familiar with and dealing with dissatisfied customers, though I always tried to create the best solutions for all possible. I enjoyed the overall office environment, comaraderie, lounge was great, along with a vast array of vending machines. The desks were spacious and very comfortable."
good,"Aprendí mucho sobre el trato con clientes internos y externos, manejo de recursos, planificación, me ayudo para la carrera que estoy estudiando (Licenciatura en Logística) y de la cual fui becado en parte por la empresa, pero actualmente no me esta dando la posibilidad de trasladarme a Buenos Aires."
good,worked on automative dialer. Call center. I learned alot working at ADT. The training was extensive and very thorough. One of the best training classes I have ever had at a job.
good,Great company to work with vast opportunity for advancement.
good,An Adt reaction officer must be a time keeper and professional
good,La journée de travail est toujours chargé à cause du volume des appels (alarmes)
good,When I first started it was a fun loving place to work. After only 2 years being a customer service representative I was promoted to a Customer Retention Agent that required fast knowledge of all working platforms and programs across ADT. Even with this much responsability it was a great place to work till the end. The management went downhill made up lies to fire people including myself which they never could prove to me or to unemployment and something the EEOC said they should not have done.
good,On straight commission you're going to have to work hard and long in order to do well there. If you do that you can make a good living.
good,Good company to work for. The work you hard. The managers are good. The good the bad the ugly. Don't try this at home. It's time again to get it and work hard.
good,Adt is a good company to work for. Pleasant environment with pleasant people.  My experience was over all very good. Managers and teams are changing on a regular basis. Very demanding in the area of personal performance.
good,"It’s whatever you make it depending on management. Jobs, pay, insurance is pretty good. They do random thing to keep the floor fun in a stressful call center."
good,"This job is a fast paced and you need to think outside the box to get all your service/install appointments done. Don't expect to leave from home or get home at the same time every day. I learned how to install various types of hardwired and wireless alarm systems, including but not limited to  various system programming features to add and delete alarm zones. Management was not very supportive unless you were getting all tickets done AND sell system upgrades. Culture was rarely helpful, felt like I had opponents not team mates. Best thing about job is you get to see a lot of eastern half of PA"
good,I have worked at ADT's call center for a little over a year. They have great benefits and good PTO. Insurance is good and you pay hardly anything for vision and dental. Atmosphere is pretty good as well.
good,I was in the sales department. It was very boring. I left due to a better paying job but this job didn’t really have a lot of hours I think it was a total of 25-30 hours a week
good,ADT was a really cool experience i learned so much on how to sell and why people buy. Also really gained the confidence to approach random doors and get into their homes and sell them on a new system. But you definitely need the mental toughness to receive countless rejections and still push to find the yes. Only down fall was how competitive it was and if you didn’t hit your numbers for the month you were gone. And i personally feel like that’s not the type of job security I’d like for the future.
good,Supportive and collaborative environment after you get past the kinks..... Leadership is awesome overall. Miss working with the Irving/Dallas TX team!
good,"Es un muy buen trabajo. Buen sueldo y condiciones contractuales, pero los supervisores dejan mucho que desear ya que se desentienden totalmente de uno. Por ejemplo si hay problemas con las computadoras, no hay lugares disponibles, etc."
good,"Great benefits and good pay.  "
good,Good company. It is really rewarding to protect people and see the peace of mind you bring them. Some of them have had very traumatic experiences and are very relieved. Pay is well and excellent management.
good,"My role consisted of managing an outside sales team to achieve sales, hit quotas and ensure overall customer satisfaction from the initial walk-through through post installation."
good,"Typical day was logging in 5 min before your shift, take calls immediately whether it be related to billing or technical issues with equipment. I'd schedule appointments for customers. Throughout the day I would taken off the phones to help other team members with stressors or areas of struggle. Hardest part was the stress of the job, sometimes there were horrid customer stories. Most enjoyable part is the team work."
good,we traveled and worked a lot and the opportunities were hard to come by but i did have a very successful week there but most were not. The job was loosely guided and we were expected to be our own time managers which we did.
good,The compensation is ok and would be better if they had a system for cancels because of things that were discussed over the phone and aren't techs fault.
good,"This company has great managers.  It offered advancement opportunities.  The pay rate was low, but the stress level was minimal and the managers fostered growth and improvement."
good,"Problemas con pagos comisión"
good,The company is great you just have to be very gial driven. They will absolutely give you all of the support you need to be successful but you have to do the work.
good,Great to get started as a first full-time job or for customer service experience. Extremely flexible with accommodating their employees as far as time off.
good,"The team was very friendly,management good too, but  I worked to ADT just one year, maybe I will have the chance to be in their team again."
good,"-Culture and work environment are above average and one of the best features of working there. "
good,"I don't care about your review, blah blah blah, ready for this mimimum letter thing to be done with cause im not going to say anything here so go ahead and click next"
good,"Great Union job but endless hour's to work. The company is ranked #1 in home security. Th management is very good and helpful. Where once you deal with customers on the field , the  sometimes be a handful besides that overall great company."
good,Great company and corporate structure.  Amazing people and fast paced environment.  If you want to advance your career there is plenty of opportunity to learn and grow in the organization.
good,Great place to work. Leadership from CEO down really care about the business and the people who work for them. Great work culture. Compensation is low.
good,"While you are not given much flexibility on work and it is very fast paced with moderate sales goals, it offers good pay and excellent commission.  As long as you are able to stay focused and are willing to expect a sore throat from talking, it can be very lucrative."
good,lo que mas destaco de la empresa es la contención de parte de los directivos de la empresa. siempre atentos a la hora de las necesidades de los clientes . una vez a la  semana almuerzo laborales siempre los días viernes
good,"Clock in to work, take calls, 15 min break, take calls, 30 min lunch, takes calls go home. Every week you have a meeting with your team lead about your teams/yourself performance."
good,ADT has great ways to advance your career. They provide the excellent training and new product seminars. They are a good company to work for and I would recommend them to a friend.
good,"Learned a lot from this company in many tech skill sets and customer interactions and needs. Everything from install, to sales , Many perks w benefits"
good,Really enjoyed being around great co-workers. The managers were friendly too. The work was easy to do after learning how to do it. I did have really good hours too.
good,"Good corporate culture with collaborative work ethic between management and employees.  Group events keep people interested in working as teams."
good,They didn't pay me enough for my job. They brung new employees in making way more than I made and I had more experience. They added more and more responsibilities to the job but didn't want to compensate.
good,"In the company you should be accurate have listening skills and communications skills and make sure you adhere to every clients complain "
good,the work hours are good latest you get off is 12am. learn a lot about alarm systems and the management there were great. Coworkers was a lot of relations going on in there.
good,Sales manager is very supportive and the company invests a great deal on it's sales representative training as well as providing support when needed across the board.
good,"Fun place to work, great co-workers, fantastic kitchen that was fairly priced, large break area's. Ping pong table, Xbox, lots of TV's. Lots of time with managers and lots of training."
good,"This is a commission only job, which is okay for now but I really need something that is more consistent.  My manager is great though, very helpful, knowledgeable and understanding of my needs as a new employee."
good,ADT is a fair employer. Suceeding within the company is completely dependant on how much of a self motivated an invidual you are. Each office and area are completely different in their team building & cooperation.
good,"I enjoyed working with ADT. I feel the commission structure could be better with the amount of work you have to do. The support was not that great either but the managers are amazing when they are around. They had fun events to keep you motivated, which helped. Just a few minor tweaks and this place could be amazing."
good,"The culture was great.  A very employee oriented company. Management was involved with the employees.  They took each issue, whether good or bad into consideration and reacted to the best of their ability."
good,This company gave me the opportunity grow and advance along with them.  I was able to learn multiple facets of the business and was always provided the opportunities to learn.
good,grato ambiente laboral y bonita experiencia buena capacitacion
good,"the idea is great..."
good,I was on the admin team and the work was not bad. Sometimes the people can ruin the atmosphere by being petty but I stayed away from those kind to focus on the reason why I was there: my family.
good,"It has a great working environment , everyone is very friendly."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, compañerismo, trabajo bajo presion"
good,Receive in bound calls to help customers make decisions on upgrading security systems and handling customer service calls from many different departments.
good,"I loved my time with ADT, My co-workers were the best very supportive and helpful. I do think they need to strengthen their managerial level. They were not always on the same page which causing a lot of confusion with the hourly employees. i feel like the pay could be a little better especially with their competition and other call centers in the new economy. job advancement was amazing, They do highly encourage in house advancement."
good,"	Manage large calls dealing with customers, insurance companies, police departments, and the fire department"
good,fast paced but great company to work for.  would recommend to my friends.  the owner takes a lot of pride in the company that he built
good,"ADT is definitely a challenge if thats what you are looking for. Great company to work for they really try to give you all the tools to be successful in this business, however it really boils down to what you do and what territory you are given. I made pretty god money the time I was there but for me I didn't like not knowing where my money was coming from next. I sold a lot but only got paid on what was installed and for many reasons just because you sale it doesn't mean you will get it installed. ADT has a great team environment everyone i met and worked with was helpful in anyway I need it. Driving and cold call on the streets was by far the most draining and challenging part of the job although I was equipped with with a script and practiced it at times it got draining. If you like a challenge and like to make alot of money I say give it a try see if its for you. The training is great and so is the management and staff."
good,"Management at this co is friendly to talk to.It is a big co worldwide.they are the best in customer service in response and guarding,technicians know their job as well"
good,Quality is my desire to do the best I can so client or customer is happyi'am retired looking for small jjobs or driving jobs under the table.prefer cash!
good,"As an ADT Securities technician we visit two to three customers every work day to do full instals, service or upgrades of alarm systems."

good,ADT is a good company to work for. I have gained  so much product knowledge and a lot of sales experience from here. It's just time to venture on because so much is changing.
good,"It's been great experience to work with a company, having big name in security industry for more than 120 years. It's great honor for me to work for peopleto design their security systems that provides them peace of mind."
good,"As a well know entity ADT service major areas and provide multiple services related to home and business security."
good,I love working here. They treat employees with respect and dignity. They always want to make sure that you are happy to ensure that the customers are happy. Plenty of opportunity for growth if you are interested in going forward in the company.
good,Responsible for completing jobs on my own time and schedule. Responsible for having parts and being on time. Great customer relations
good,It allows you to use all of your customer service skills and to talk with a large number of people. and to also have flexible work hours.
good,"Great job to get your foot in the door for an office job, it teaches you responsibility and work ethics in an office environment."
good,"Loved the responsibility, management was good for the most part, co-workers were great. Loved be independent and the responsibility that came with the title."
good,"It was an Office that was being rebuilt. in the few months that I was there we were working on getting it turned around. The Gen. Manager and I worked close together along with the Salesmen, in doing what needed to be done to build the business back up."
good,"Your typical call center. They are fairly lenient with tardiness, but are very strict when it comes to meeting quotas. Free coffee, and a few vending machines. There is A LOT of training, and you are constantly learning new material."
good,"Trabajo en terreno, aprendí a vender, la gerencia nunca la conocí pero se sentía una buena administración y coordinación de grupos desde donde estaba yo. Los colegas me enseñaron mucho y hacían que el desarrollo de las responsabilidades fueran gratas. Lo más difícil del trabajo era estar en la calle todo el día y no tener mucho tiempo. Se ganaba buen dinero y el ambiente era grato."
good,"set schedules ,overtime opportunities, great management. positive environment always working on moral team work and safety."
good,The line of work is very important because we protect our customers and their properties. The work environment is always very positive and the management is very supportive and always willing to help.
good,loved assisting customers and providing installation technicians with internal customer service
good,"O tipo de trabalho era executado em comunhão de acordo com diretoria e engenharia."
good,"The day would start with lead call notifications, anybody in your area needing services would be directed to you. The challenge was getting to new business quickly and keeping current clients happy. The hardest part of the job was keeping your leads from being reassigned due to a clinch in the system, or repeated request calls made by the client. I learned very quickly that organization and prep time was crucial to my success at this company."
good,"I worked in the FSC (field support center) where we received calls from techs installing or done installing security systems in homes and small businesses.  We either helped them with installation or confirmed signals and entered all account information and gave them confirmation of signals.  "
good,"Managed and mentored Crews of technicians and managers. Prepared manpower projections and profitability reports. Setup training and continuing education for employees. Setup and maintained the apprentice program, providing the technicians to obtain and maintain their licenses required by state law.

Constantly look for new talented potential employees. Present reports to upper management that provide vital information for future growth of the company and its employees."
good,Uma  empresa que me ajudou muito na ampliação dos meus conhecimentos.
good,"Great company!  Management is exceptional, company believes in investing in its people and there are opportunities to make a decent living."
good,"Good place to work, lack of room for advancement with out moving."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"Contract jobs and usual local taxi jobs along with airport runs both locally and to other cities like Birmingham and  London , "
good,Typical work day was helping tec over the phone with loging in and out of jobs helping customer over the phone with alarm system and seting up appt
good,"ADT is a strict company that expects a lot out of their employees. They have a fantastic training class and help you every step of the way. Only tough part is being on time. If you clock in even 1 minute late you get written up. Three of those in one year leads to termination, which is why their turn-over rate is so high. "
good,"A typical day would be the team being on the phone competing on who can make the most sales in 6 hours."
good,Typical work day cavassing was laid back and all the walking keeps you in shape! I learned about the systems and exactly how they work. Co-workers were awesome and fun to be around. Hardest part was selling  the neighborhoods that needed it most due to cost. Most enjoyable part was working outside in the sun. No security as a female having to walk inside a strangers home to sell this product if they were interested. Your first step was to enter the basement to find out what type of system they required and have the information ready to the supervisor. Need some sort of call button incase of an emergency and you don't have the opportunity or service to use your cell phone.
good,I learned so much and felt appreciated at all times. People were easy to work with because there was a lot of team work and solution thinking from each member.
good,A typical day would be auditing of new/closed accounts and inbound phone calls.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist customers on a daily basis.  Also being able to troubleshoot problems and actually fix them.
good,"Fun learning job, speaking with about 99% good spirited technicians on the field, paid weekly and secure building."
good,ADT security services would be a good start for a customer service/call center first job experience. Human Resources is very thourgh  will explaining any issues with payroll. Although I'm no longer with the company I still recommend to others. I enjoyed being around the other agents and experienced agents. Some managers were also once a agent so there wasent pressure and they understood some of the day to day situations with residents and alarm systems.
good,"I loved working here!  Although, working graveyards there was not much to do.  However, the people around me kept everything entertaining.  Training prepared you for any call that may come your way as well as one on one couching with your supervisor every week."
good,As a Customer Relations Manager at ADT I enjoyed the continuing challenge of resolving customer issues and working with others in my company to do so. My manager and director were excellent mentors.
good,High energy sales environment. Many contests going on being held with different sales teams in order to increase company morale and boost competitive spirits. Co-workers are like family members there is a very strong bond of teamwork that unites us all. Management is strict when necessary but also very understanding. The hardest part of the job was when customers did not have the funds to purchase the services they need from us. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could help a customer feel like they were safe. 
good,"Good Company, vehicle and gas card provided, Manager provided good guidance, I enjoyed the challenges and taking care of customers."
good,"Mi trabajo en ADT me ha enseñado a relacionarme con diferentes tipos de clientes , teniendo que ser muy responsable y a la vez entregar el máximo de confianza, ya que son sus bienes o sus mayores logros los que confían en uno como ejecutivo , siempre he tratado de ser responsable en cuanto a lo que ofrezco tratando de explicar los pros y contra de cada producto, ser diligente en la instalación y dar lo mejor de mi en Post- venta; creo que como Jefatura he tenido la posibilidad de tener excelentes Jefe y colegas de trabajo, tiendo a tener muy buenas relaciones con los demás."
good,"Conference call, appointments."
good,"A typical day would be taking incoming phone calls from customers who wished to discuss disputes on their invoices. I would discuss the matter with them, and try to resolve there and then, with an explanation and maybe offer to reduce the amount due. I would also have my own ledgers of outstanding disputes to look at, and would prioritise these in order of value."
good,Since I started a year and half ago they changed the pay plan 3 times. Each time chipping away the pay and perks.
good,Able to establish and maintain a good relationship with external and internal customers.
good,Sell jobs and help company expand
good,"A typical starts with following a schedule that was set a day prior which would include cold calls, face to face meetings. Ive learned that communication and networking is key to fostering positive relationships. Co-workers are essential for positive, professional growth. The hardest part of the job is consulting with customers whom I want to help but are resistant to that help or change their mind after already agreed upon criteria. The most agreeable part of the job is seeing a customer satisfied with their purchase and they refer me to someone else I could help."
good,"Each day, I log in to a computer and a phone and field inbound phone calls from a variety of customers regarding many aspects of their ADT alarm systems. While doing this I respond to my coworker's technical questions via Microsoft Communicator and Outlook. Between calls, or during slow paced calls I maintain an internal website for the housing and propagation of knowledge. This website contains screenshots, tutorials, tips, tricks, and just about anything an agent would need. My current manager has been an informal adviser of mine for years and was the original creator of the website that I work so hard to maintain. Working on the site is my favorite part of the job - it brings me great joy to create something, and to assist my coworkers in this unique manner. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, but that is part of the territory; i always do my best to maintain a friendly tone."
good,"A typical day consisted of making and receiving phone calls, dispatching patrol officers to various locations and monitoring burglar alarms."
good,"A typical day doing security system installation consists of arriving at the office at 8 A.M.and reviewing the jobs for the day. After determining the type of installations you are assigned for the day you request parts to complete the installation. Before leaving you call your customers to verify their address and appointment times to prevent any confusion or missed appointments. Upon arriving at the installation site you introduce yourself to your customer and have them show you around the home noting where the devices will be placed. After the walk around, you begin to lay out the wire at the openings that will be monitored and determine a place to install the ""can"" which is the tempered steel enclosure the brain that controls the system will be placed. After that step it is time to drill your window and door openings normally using a 3 ft bell hanger drill bit pulling the wire to the attic after the drilling is complete. At this point it is time to crawl into the attic to pull all of your wires to a location above the ""can"" where they will all be stripped and divided next. Now it is time to identify your wire and strip all of it into a neat easy to work with bunch. After stripping the wire you determine how many zones the system will have and match zones together in a series circuit. After completing your wiring it is time to plug the system in and program it which basically tells the system what is there and any preference the customer may have. The final step is to call the monitoring center to put the system on a test to prevent the police and fire department from being"
good,it was a very busy environment - a large call centre with a lot of staff to manage on a daily basis.
good,I would return to ADT once they have completed the separtation from Tyco.
good,"Great enviorment, staff, and workers. Benefits are great as well."
good,"its a very relax but strict enviroment , at start of work day , goals set based on previous day , with the number of changes and new companies ...weekly training management always available , willing to assist if needed ...none as being hard everything right there when needed....overall job was enjoyable"
good,The collections department assists other departments as needed
good,Nice atmosphere to work. Learned the product and how to speak with a potential client who was interested. Spoke of promotions and special offers. Created relationships with clients.
good,"Can recommend someone to work for Adt,is not bad at all one can grow and learn new technical problem solving"
good,"I was a contractor working for ADT 2G to 3G project. They pay is good, you get a nice van. I enjoyed my time at ADT, shame the contract ended. I had 8 more characters to put in!"
good,enjoyed the people and culture highly competitive internally between managers and trainers. Very goal orientated environment. great bosses and staff. lots of travel
good,"Muy buena seguridad para laborar, disciplinada, salario digno, aprendes todos los días nuevas cosas."
good,Enjoyed fellow employees and management. I still need 100 more characters. I would have not used indeed if I knew this before. I have nothing more to say.
good,Great company great culture to work for at times. You must follow up on your accounts work very hard. Make a bunch of phone calls. And knock doors at least 4 days a week. The company overall would like you to succeed to make them successful. Work environment can be stressful. Do your best not to take home work with you.
good,"It was indeed pleasure serving ADT and all the respective customers. Amazing trainer, delivered fantastic training and support. Appreciated support from management."
good,I did not have a typical work day it was something new everyday and i learned something new everyday the culture was diverse the hardest part of the job was the system shutting down at times and waiting to start work
good,Loved working there. Unfortunately I had to move back to Florida due to family reasons. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family. The thing I liked most was it's people.
good,"Good company to work for ,they take safety very seriously,all the vehicles are equipped with drive cam which records when an event occurs like hard beaking,an even road and speeding. They do both  vehicle and officer inspection every month. All managers are good to work with and the company gives chances to improve  before they can fire you. Pay increase every year and this year they go new cars for patrol officers. Also when u are hired and start work,ADT helps you to get street patrol officer permit from LaPD commissioner  which is good for 1 year and ADT pays for it."
good,ADT has excellent benefits and lots of room for growth. From entry level to management. If you put in the work and utilize the tools given you can be successful.
good,Great place to build a technical background learn how to trouble shoot and operate your business in a sense. i really enjoy working here just moving on to cyber security.
good,"Fantastic, motivational sales meetings. Leads were often promising. "
good,"If you can handle low pay to start and want to work in a great environment.  ADT offers really good entry level jobs and does great training.  The managers are really nice and will help you as much as they possibly can.  However, the pay to start is fairly low and raises are not very good.  Advancement opportunities are there often and they give priority to in house employees.  Advancement is also accompanied by raise in pay.  If you have patience and can handle low pay at first, they are a great company to work for."
good,"The people were fun to work with.  They had flexible schedules and you could choose to take 1/2 hour, 3/4 hour or one hour lunches.  The worse part of the job as being micromanaged."
good,"Very good place to work and understanding of life issues, just communicate with management/HR.  The technology allows for hands on experience of new product and allows for time to learn."
good,"Adt provides some leads but you are expected to create and seek out SGs self generated leads. Flexible ,work remotely if you can.Meetings get old fast"
good,"It's been a while since I worked at ADT's Call Center, however I did like working there. The turnover was high because of attendance, but overall a great place to work."
good,"I enjoy this job.  I'm seeking for opportunities to advance and make a better salary. I have accomplished my goals with this company.  Starting in customer service, promoting to advance care customer representative.   Promoting again within the company to a billing administrator, which is my current position."
good,"ADT is a great place to work based on the short time I have been there. They have a good and positive work environment. I have never worked in a call center, but you are not ever alone when answering calls. There is always help available if you need it. I am just a more dealing with the public in person type person, not so much phone wise all the time person."
good,"This is a very large company with deep roots in American culture and heritage. It requires a lot of human resources to get the various tasks completed. Because of that, there will be varying opinions of the business. My experience is that from an overall perspective, your performance can dictate how far you get up the ladder. It may not happen overnight because there are many others competing for the next rung on that ladder as well. Being a well rounded politician that never gives up and is always positive can increase your possibility of promotion. Negative scuttlebutt can kill you here. Always make friends that are your Allies."
good,"Working for this organization provided me a great stepping stone experience."
good,"A typical day at work consisted in providing field technicians with technical support and customer with technical service."
good,Productive and exciting place to work at. I received a lot of experience working here. In this job I worked with different diversities which gave me the opportunity to learn how to be a team player and how to work together in a demanding environment.The management was very nice and considerate of it's employees. Everyone was willing to help each other if any problems occurred.
good,"Throughout my career at ADT Security i have had the opportunity to learn as much about the business as possible. In my 8 years i have been promoted 4 times and been mentored by various Managers to get to the position i hold currently."
good,"I enjoyed everything except for the stagnancy of the job. I became a waitress and paramedic after this job, so naturally I am a mover. Sitting at a desk was too much for me to handle some days."
good,"good entry sales position"
good,Lots of earning potential but some internal staff issues with constantly changing management.  They couldn't seem to hire the correct candidates from the available candidates.  All management eventually got let go after a few months.
good,Buen clima laboral en el que vendiamos mediante un speach sobre los productos designados.
good,Una buena empresa. Lideres en el rubro de la seguridad. Buena post venta y posee instaladores clasificados y honrados
good,"love working with adt, but my position requires lots of traveling out of my area, I'm looking to stay local because of family needs me at home. and all my work its overnight"

good,"While any call center atmosphere is stressful, ADT tries to incorporate a stress free environment during your free time with quiet rooms, ping pong tables and tv monitors to watch as well. ADT provided all resources that you need in order to be successful within the center."
good,"Very busy sometimes stressful, there are days where we had to work a lot of hours because the department stayed in Queue. Some times the moral is so low."
good,On a typical day at work I would start at 8am and leave at 5pm. Get my accounts that I was working on at the current time. Check emails and voicemails. Process returned checks. Contact members with appropriate follow-up on delinquent accounts. Process returned checks. Counsel and refer members to budgetary counseling to assist in reduction/elimination of delinquent accounts. Recommended accounts for charge off when necessary.

good,i got picked up we would walk around to each house try to get some deals and yeah some days good some not. the list would be given by our supervisor usually at the beginning oft the weeks. then we go to the towns.
good,ADT Security was a good company to work for i enjoyed my time there. Sales can be tough to get but overall they have the tools you need if you put the work in.
good,This was a great starting point.I  worked here while attending college.My management was very understanding of my goals and aspirations.I was mentored properly and they were patient.
good,"I loved talking with technician in the field, helping them daily on technical issues and just making their day easier through me. Taking over 80 calls daily."
good,I  love this company because you can really change the out come of each situation by helping the customer in making right decision on their service or  give them the right tools.
good,good managers and good trainings all was perfect at ADT shootin was organised and driving skills. advanced driving and combat training as well as safety was being taken care of to all officers

good,"Aprendí muchas cosas en un corto plazo, en plataforma todos muy gentiles"
good,"Manager and supervisor are on top of everything. Thyetee make sure that thech have all ressources that tech need to complete the job, they also assit tech on their daily basis."
good,ADT provides a good work environment.The pay is competitive for the industry. The benefits are great. The training that the company offers is better that most.
good,"OT is almost always demanded"
good,"The hardest part was getting leads. Some were sent to us by the company but most we had to get. These were by referrals, cold calling and ads. For the worst was cold calling. I know that I do not like to gets these sale calls at home so I did not enjoy making them."
good,ADT was the first job I took after selling my business. It was exciting to learn the technology and how the company dominated the market. Good place to be at the time.
good,"My job at ADT was a great experince. All the managers were all great, they cared about you and your family. I loved working with my co-workers. We would have great christmas parties."
good,"Good place. Made some nice friends. I wasn't a fan of the so called leads they provided, but putting in the effort is the requirement for all sales people. Gotta do what you gotta do."
good,"Just got a new manager one month prior to relocation.  I enjoyed working with previous managers. I appreciated the online job assist tools as well as the call in help desk. ADT constantly aquired new businesses and different monitoring systems. When they put employees from those companies in our department, we were able to help familiarize each other with different equipment."
good,"ADT gave me the skills I needed in order to move on into another company , It allowed me to expand my customer service knowledge and skills. The employees are understanding and helpful"
good,ADT Security is a place where I learned alot. It tought me to be a responsible person that I was always looking for to go save lives. I would really love to do it again and saves more lives in the future.
good,This was a great challenge for me because I had sales management experience but not commission only sales experience.  So I challenged my self to revamp my management style to adjust to the culture.
good,Very good work environment with good co workers and very nice customers who make my job pleasant when the managers and staff set up my visit making the customers friendly
good,Gave a good part of my life to company. Was a good company to work for then. Not sure now. Management and supervisory was good during my time. Liked what I did.
good,"Great Managers"
good,"ADT is a great place to put in some hard work and reap the rewards, with any commission based job what you put in is usually what you get out but it takes time and practice to improve sales skills. Manager is helpful, can be on our back when numbers are down but that is expected, co-workers work together while maintaining that competitive edge, we do not fight for territory as manager make it best as possible for areas not to overlap. If you do well  here you will be encouraged to go harder, potential is there, it just takes time and patience to get there."
good,Fun Loving Company to work with. Benefits are great . Its a relaxed atmosphere to work in. Great Leadership. Opportunities for growth and advancement.
good,I worked there for 5 years. It was a great job until some major competitors got in to the alarm business. ADT had the market cornered for decades and everything changed quickly. They never were never willing to lower there prices to compete.
good,I wish we never got sold to Tyco. ADT had an awesome management team and a better way of doing things and treating their employees. I believe that they are still a great place to work for.
good,The pace is fast and culture is ever-changing. I must say I enjoyed the job much more before the company was bought by Protection-One. Since the buy out the center I worked at was broadening the agent's role to the point of making it almost impossible to be successful.

good,Great company to work for with benefits. Very high paced and stressful. Constant whip to get the job done and meet quotas. Always demanding time management but constantly stealing your time to get on the next conference call or report sent up. Peers in same role environment are great to work with.

good,"I learned how to treat clients,people around you and workmates.Management treats people working  under them with respect. And Cleanliness is mandatory"
good,"Working at ADT teaches you how to pay attention to detail. When working as an emergency dispatch operator, you learn to listen to background noise, the way someone is speaking, keywords that might tip you off that someone is in trouble.

Either knowing that it is what it is OR that something will be worked on. TOP Senior Management in my area and feel good about what gets trickled down. 99% of the people I have come in contact with are awesome. If you look for the bad, you will find it...period. If you advocate for change, you will see it here... that is good stuff."

When they relocated me they paid for everything my new apartment, no bills, no rent, and they gave me a company gas card.  The only bad thing was I lived in Addison, Tx when I was working for them and only worked 3 days and a total of 6 hrs.  They sent employees home for 2 weeks which was fine because I got too see my family and friends.  After the 2 weeks the called us too be back at our apartment by January 4, 2017.  We went back on the 3rd and the next day we were laid off for budget cuts."

good,"During my tenure there were 3 owners. There have been 2 more since I retired. The new owner seems to be pretty good.  I was well compensated but would not recommend this company as a career path.  They, like most other alarm companies will not invest in properly training employees.  You either sink or swim in 90 days."
good,"This job was very busy and I had to work over time to finish the work before the end of the day.  I have learned a lot about ADT and it is very different than any other jobs that I have worked for but except, scanning and data entry.  The hardest part of the job was to able to catch up on my scanning documents and someone had to help me out until the work was done and then I had to work by myself to a normal schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to work on my data entry seperate from scanning."

good,"A day here was not typical for me, as it started early and ended late and far away from my home most evenings.  Learning that unfortunately, homes need protection 24/7 today because our society has changed with burglars going to work when the public goes to work.  The workpace culture was always positive while the most difficult portion of the job was the company moving out of the area 85 miles.....the closing of the company.  There was not a difficult portion of this job!  I enjoyed being a Top Producer in Northern California and being employeed with this Firm."

One would have to let the customer know how important it was to secure the system for the protection of family and their possessions. Call Center environment over 500 Customer service/Collectors.

good,"A typical day started with inspections assigned by the manager for a specific area of town. Appointments ranged from 8am to 6pm, and I would travel to these locations using a keymap or gps. Once on site I would inspect the alarm system in the home. I would then provide an on-site report to the prospective buyer and the home inspector. Many times homes were not equipped with alarm systems and I would make recommendations to the buyer on how to adequately secure their home. Dealing with the public (home inspector, buyer, real estate agents) was great because I met new people everyday. The hardest part of the job was the many hours and miles I spent driving to the locations. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility in schedule."
good,"typical day would on consisted of servicing / repairing/ resolving issues with alarm systems and cctv equipment, i leanerd all key skills about fault finding and repair systems, the most enjoyable job was the traviling and meeting new people"

good,"The variety of systems and applications needing service kept you on your toes both in diagnosing and keeping up with the needed manuals. Local management, most up from doing install and service, were aware of the job requirements. The national dispatch system was poorly set up and frequently wrong about many parts of the job like travel times at rush hour. The softwares lack of knowledge about the choke points in traffic such as tunnels and bridges made scheduling service a pigs breakfast many days. The wireless device used for dispatch was very usefull when kept updated allowing alarm history to be accessed as needed."
good,Very pleasant to work for. Looks out for their employees and also give customer great satisfaction. Co-workers were all willing to work together if needed to get the task completed. Local management tried to keep things to grow the company but did not push the employees to death to get it done.
good,Working for ADT as a team leader was a great and exciting challenge. Got to know individuals in my team and ended up being competitive on the floor and a great family. The support from management was helpful and welcomed. Good relationships with internal and external clients.
good,Their training program is a bit mediocre the way you find out that you’re doing something wrong it’s at the end of a pin rather than saying something to the person first constantly threatening your job The job was super easy the pay I believe is fair do you throw it in your job for quality and Sales that parts not really a big problem but when you want and expect everyone to remain 99% There’s a problem because you’re asking people to be perfect when no one is perfect
good,"A typical day has a lot of driving to get to the client then establishing a good rapport with the client. Mounting the panel and wiring it to the phone and electrical lines was the hardest part. After that, all that was need was programming and explaining the system"
good,"Mostly easy job "
good,Enjoyed working but they kept raising the bar They became more demanding. More sales all the time being a lot of pressure. A typical day start at 8 till 6pm The hardest part of the job was door knocking.

good,"As a mother of 3 children (at the time) I was able to balance home life and work life effectively because the company had incredible training and stability that I could rely on.  I had a promotion to management within my first year and I could have not been happier with the level of training I received to achieve that.  The company seemed to focus on the needs of the employees, and I was 100% satisfied with the benefit plan that was inexpensive and necessary for myself and children."
good,"Great management great company. commission only.  A lot of windshield time.great benefits.You need to talk to 50 different potential customers a day, to be successful. You also have to take about 2 years to build a referral base."
good,Goingtohomesand installing security systems. Hardest part is selling customers. i learn how to sell systems and install them. It take 1 hour to intall
good,"Great culture and usually fun to work with the people in the environment. However, there is an extreme disconnect between executive management and what they enact, and how our daily operations really work. They change standard operating procedures without changing position matrix first, making employees review number look terrible when they used to be great."
good,fun people to work with loved my coworkers management was great pay was great they have great benefits overtime is possible when it is available overall good company
good,It was good money for me and I had a son. Secure environment to work in and good people. Your breaks are practically on time unless you're caught on a call and you have to be back on time.
good,"ADT provides self-growth for individuals  Excellent starting pay.  Most people will come in, take inbound or make outbound phone calls dependent upon your role. Inbound is technical support, outbound is alarm calling.  It is an excellent culture, with Team Managers that will help give you the tools necessary to complete your job.  They strongly belief in 70/30 coaching; having the agent determine what they could have done better as opposed to providingyou with a list of deficiencies.  The hardest part of the job is sitting down all day, and occasionally being yelled at for situations beyond your control.  The most enjoyable part of the job are people that you work with, along with the culture that ADT provides."
good,"If you work at the ADT location in Aurora, CO your typical day is fast paced, management is always willing to answer any question and help you advance your career if you would like. If feels like everyone knows each other and get along well."

good,"The management are very supportive. They will do everything they can to help you succeed. The company is always treating their employees to catered meals and have fun contests all the time. The have multiple TV's, as well as an Xbox and a ping pong table in the break rooms."
good,ADT give you the tools you need to succeed but you get out what you put in.  You essential are your own boss.  Yes you have to meet a corporate quota but attend sales meetings but other than that you drive your own business.  Flexible hours is a perk!
good,"Company and door to door selling. Great management and training."
good,"On a typical day at work there is fast pace work environment. I learned how to deal with many different issues that you would face by the help of team leads. When it comes to management, there is a lot of support and help available. There are many different races and ethnicity to where you will comfortable. The hardest part about the job is the verbiage. The most enjoyable part about the job is when they have fun and games on your break."

good,great job kelly my boss was great  i made good money leads were provided.adt would provide training and leads easy to sell security
good,Very safe and reliable environment. also fast paced and quick days. Alot of advancement opportunities . Needs better managers and more communication between departments.
good,"It was a great place to learn for a junior, however, it was a challenge because of the compensation plan. It was commissioned only for them. It took a while to get the confidence and the “know how” to get sufficient sales volume to build a decent salary. The result was a very high turn over in the sales force. Many were called but only a few were chosen at the end of the day. "
good,commission only but you can earn a lot of money to catch up on a lot of bills. The hardest part of the job is trying to close each sale with all customers and driving far distances. But the compensation is reward able and meeting new people daily is awesome.
good,"Exceptional benefits package to include Tuition Reimbursement, Medical, 401k plan. Good Schedule and excellent merit raises."
good,Management must know it's staff and provide team building to improve team spirit. Every product must have training so the staff can be well equiped when talking to clients. Happy staff gives good results.
good,ADT helped me grow more in the customer service field. I loved my co-workers. I've learned patience with this company and learning the pros and cons of what to expect when getting a security system. Management was ok. The most enjoyable part if being there is creating memories with my lifetime friends as well as my technicians
good,"Very simple job, clock in through a time-clock on a computer, plug your headset in, and login to the phone, then take inbound calls through and automated phone system, helping customers and consumers with any situation they may have. that was the pleasure of the job though, learning multiple through the 6-week training class, as well as learning on the job with all the situations possible as well as the products ADT supplies and markets. Also with the fellow co-workers there is not a question that cannot get answered. All the employees are willing and happy to help anyone in need. However there are some situations that are harder to resolve. even with those times, the environment is still very much enjoyable and more than likely the best part of the job."
good,Took pride in the product and made allot of sales. I enjoyed talking to new people and offering them a security that looked out for their best interest.
good,I really enjoyed this job the only thing that was stressful to me was that at first they wanted it to be commission based. I really liked the company and the my workers were friendly. This a job that you have to have tough skin for because some customers can be a little rough. But if you enjoy challenges and easy money you will love this job.
good,"- Very easy days, work at your own schedule, worked with father for ADT services"
good,"The best part about ADT is their management. All managers were courteous, professional and excellent. The worst part of the job was the few customers who were having bad days and wanted to include you in their unhappiness."
good,"Empresa que preza os valores,"
good,The day as a PS would start fairly stable there are rushes towards the end of technicians shifts. The hardest part is making sure each tech has enough time for their jobs and the scheduling system gant is set up properly
good,ADT was a very educational and enjoyable place of employment.  The management was excellent and supportive.  The hardest part of the job was the required marketing calls each morning.  This was productive and necessary however it was very time consuming.
good,The only complaint I have is their wages they could be better.  Great hardworking coworkers.  They give you all the training you need to excel at your job.
good,"typical day consisted of driving from appointment to appointment fresno,chowchilla,tulare,visalia,hanford,lemoore and even the mountains. Where ever it may be. sometimes you have 3 appointments a day, sometimes you have 1 or none. New reps start out with a base pay for one year, plus commission pay. They give you a ipad, and pay for your phone bill, Gas reimbursement  and bonuses. great pay, just not for me. I need a work/life balance. you have the opportunity to make over the 55k a"

good,"This job was very convenient. I was able to work here while attending high school. They were very lenient and worked around education. They were customer obsessed. I pride myself on customer service, so I enjoyed working for a company who cares as much as they did."
good,The hardest part of this job to me was that it is compensation based. If you didnt close a deal then you didnt get paid. You get what you put into it. I also did not like working door to door. But I enjoyed meeting all kinds of people and helping them protect their homes with security systems.
good,"A typical work day consisted of logging into computers systems on time taking inbound calls providing solutions to customer inquiries. I learned how to provide step by step over the phone to solutions to malfunctioning equipment, I learned the proper emergency dispatching procedure when an alarm is in progress. The management was enjoyable very helpful to my work performance. My co workers and I got along pretty well we formed friendships that allowed my time at work to be equally productive as well as enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was memorizing proper trouble shooting procedures for specific system but with time and training it became very manageable. The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that I was helping in saving lives."
good,Came in and made it through each assigned account by leaving voicemails or speaking with each customers confirming payment arrangements. After touching each account responsible for I would follow a schedule to skip trace the higher priority accounts to avoid repossession or legal actions
good,"I enjoyed working here, but you felt like a number.  My job as an outbound specialist was important in having to respond to various alarms, most times, involving law enforcement.  As an inbound specialist, I handled call made from customers who were disgruntled about their system or the service they had received from technical support."
good,"The company itself takes great care of its employees, offering them wonderful benefits, 401K, incentive bonuses, Holiday pay, and the chance to move up in your career. I myself love talking to people and interacting, however I am not the biggest fan of being on the phone 9 hours a day so this would be my only negative impact on the work that I do there. Regardless as with any job I work as hard as I can and as effectively as well."
good,"ADT is for Adult Day Training program which is the employee work with developmentally disabled adults. I start my day with greeting customers and also supervising the clients and directing them to the area their going to work in for that day. I have learned that no one is the same and everyone is different and I cannot change anyone, just except them for who they are. My managers are very understanding and have our back 100 percent. My cowokers are the best we all get along very well and we stick together when it comes to the clients and their safety while their at work. The hardest part of my day at work is when the clients come into work and their in not such a good mood and when we cannot help them no matter how hard Ive tried. The best part of my day is when I can go home knowing that Ive made someone happy or a difference in another persons day by either making them smile, laugh, or just being there for someone. Making the customers happy is also a big part in our day as well, while supervising the clients and making sure their working and following the rules."
good,"•	Handle between 150-200 inbound/outbound tech/customer calls"
good,"Great company to work for if you have a lot of time to devote. It is a 10-10 job Monday through Friday and 9-6 job on Saturday. It is well worth the hours. The management was excellent and the morale of the office is always kept high. It was a very pleasant job experience. "

good,I provide support for staff and technicians as well as customer service.
good,"Assist customers to get security for there homes or business, whether getting them to a security professional or setting a field appointment for the location. I have learned to be very patient with customers on the phone for the united states and canada. My co-workers are the best part of the job. From the good fun and also how we help each other out with work related questions that are answered without needing management. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the new technology and policy changes daily.

good,"Overall, ADT is an amazing company to work for with over 140 years in the industry offering growth and potential to excel."
good,Its not so much customer service (in aurora Colorado) as it is talking to co-workers (techs that call in from jobs). its low stress and im happy. the only thing I don't like is the drive (distance from my house).
good,"The best job I ever had. If you are willing to work the long hours typically 50 or more you will be well compensated. They are the biggest for a reason, the entire staff understands the alarm business and provides the best benefits of any low voltage job. Highly recommended."

good,"We would start the day with a group meeting on direction to meet goals."
good,"everyday we are to produce activities for new opportunities. We have daily short meetings with manager to go over my plan. I get mostly company appointed leads and its my duty to close everything we come to meet, if not at least 50% of appointments. Manager keeps us motivated and is always willing to help us close a deal. We work to strive individually but also help each other out as well. Most enjoyable part is having the ability to help other and find solutions to one's security needs and budget. Not just that but working with a great team."

I definitely feel like I learned alot and this experience has made me better and stronger for the future."
good,"Good work environment, however you are at a computer most of the day. Made good friends with the people I worked with."
good,A typical day at work consists of being on the phone interacting with clients from all over the 50 states. basically as an emergency operator you handle alarms and quickly respond to the customer to see if any help is needed. I learned so much working with a company like ADT that i never knew how hard it could be sometimes  for a 911 operator to handle so many police calls compared to what i do. the hardest part of the job is trying to get a hold of client when their alarm is going off and no one answers . the most enjoyable part of the job is the employees that make the day better and the team manager who rewards ever one of the team members for their great effort and dedication to the job.
good,A typical day at work consist of answering multiple alarm dispatch call backs and assisting customers troubleshoot their alarm systems. I learned more about providing good customer service The co-workers are friendly and willing to assist you if need be.

good,Great company to work for. Teammates were able to share personal success stories. Flexible hours. Great benefits. Self-oriented business with team encouragements.
good,"I love the work environment at ADT. Everyone generally gets along great which makes the work week easier. Managers are always helpful and there's a growing sense of employee appreciation from activities and free lunch & give aways to an Xbox and various other games in the break room. Benefits are good as well. The only downside is the nature of most of the calls. Even though this is to be expected with any customer service position, at ADT it's magnified by the fact that we deal with customer's security. Depending on the shift, call volume can be extremely heavy. If ADT is not your dream job company, opt for emergency dispatch operator if given the choice. Overall the company is nice and pay is pretty good for entry-level positions in this area."
good,"ADT Security Services is a very good place to work. Supportive management. Good work life balance."
good,"The management and other team members are all very helpful and supportive. Numbers are the main priority for upper management though.

good,ADT isn't one of those places that today you have a job tomorrow you don't. They offer a lot of overtime. When your performance isn't the best supervisors meet up with you to go over a performance plan. It is a good beginner job for a call center environment.
good,"Great company to work for great benefits, great way to gain experience, even at an entry level position."
good,"I loved working for ADT, the management treated you like an equal and even as a friend. The co-workers were all very friendly, but if you don't feel like talking everyone seemed to mind their own business. You could go in and do the job, when you leave you don't have to take work stress with you. I wish I never left. The pay was pretty great for not having a degree and if you wanted to move up in the company they made it very possible. The schedule was flexible and allowed you to switch shifts or give hours away if needed. The only issue was the attendance policy and compliance, which ended up being my own fault. If you are thinking of applying, you won't be sorry!"
good,"I really enjoy my job  career here. Family oriented , promotions always .  And the company offer open position to in house first.  Offer staff a lot of on job training."

The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely having the ability to save people's ;lives on a day to day basis with a simple phone call."
good,"With these companies I worked for there were good and not so good areas, in which is with every company. I love to show my abilities in what I can bring to each company. I am very dedicated to my work and ability to do the best I can with each place I have worked. I am very timely and accurate in all I do. In management I felt I could have been taught more and accomplished more to move forward in some areas. My co-workers supported as much as they could but was not given all to give to me to do more. The hardest part of my job was in getting all the help I needed to learn more in the area in which was required of me and the stability of the position. The most employable part is that I had the opportunity to help other agents to be more successful in making money or give greater customer service to their customers."
good,"El trabajo es bajo presión, ya que se deben cumplir metas diarias para lograr buenas calificaciones, las cuales se ven reflejadas en bonos. Aprendí a ser más tolerante, ya que por la labor a desarrollar toca enfrentarse a constantes retos de clientes por descontentos del servicio, ademas como se debe lidiar con asaltos, es muy importante nunca perder la calma y ser lo mas cuidadoso en lo que se trasmite al cliente que ante todo debe trasmitirse seguridad y confiabilidad, porque este a puesto su seguridad en nuestras manos, y esto es lo mas difícil cuando se trata con clientes que están en escenas de peligro. Los colegas de trabajos son los más difíciles de tratar dentro de la empresa y es porque en todos lados hay distintas personalidades y como es un trabajo que se evalua en forma personal siempre existe la envidia. La empresa esta administrada por personas muy cordiales y cercanas, los jefes directos son personas que trabajan hace años en la empresa por ende saben ponerle en el lugar de los ejecutivos y se trabaja en conjunto para el logro de las metas. Esto último es lo que más me gusto de esta empresa de la cual no tengo queja alguna."

My day consists of running both company generated and self generated leads/appointments, as well as staying in close contact with the install technicians making sure everything is set for the install date. I also coordinate all special orders of equipment needed for the job. I've learned a great deal about safety and security while working in this capacity, as well as learning about each individual piece of equipment.  I have a unique setting with my manager and co-workers, I am considered a remote sales rep.  I only report in person to the Houston office once per month whereas everyone else is in the office daily.  The hardest part of my job would be not being able to get the pricing where a customers budget allows all that they want in a system.

Enjoyable part is reaching your target and making your goals for the month"
good,"On a typical day employees have a morning conference call with their manager and team members. Sometimes there are meetings to go to about workplace policies, sales goals, promotions, and things like that. Most of the time employees work independently generating their own leads, making phone calls, or going to talk to customers to sell the products. This company will also give you leads. Professionally, I've learned how to generate leads, how to close sells, and how to manage my time to be more productive at work. My manager was very nice. My co-workers were nice as well though I didn't get to spend much time getting to know them because we worked by ourselves most of the time. The hardest part of the job is keeping a good work life balance. Sometimes you have appointments scheduled in the evening after customers get off work. You work 6 days a week. There is so much to do and study that it becomes a 16 hour job. The most enjoyable part of the job is realizing your potential as a seller. I never thought that I would be able to work in sales but the company trains well and the managers who have been sellers themselves are supportive."
good,Adt was a great company to work for. plesant co workers. but schedule sucks.
good,"I very much enjoyed working at the credit union!! Great team, wonderful management!! I enjoyed every moment!! Loved having a customer service relationship with all the members!! Hardest part i could say was advancement, it seemed that position that were to be open would be given to the favorites! Without giving any other employee a chance."
good,Working at a publicly traded company allows for many different career opportunities and advancement however programs/positions can easily be eliminated thus being down sized out of work is always a possibility. I did however have the opportunity to broaden my skillset and knowledge of the industry and worked with many of the best in the industry. I became a much more knowledgeable technician and when given the opportunity to leave the field gained a more thorough understanding of the integration side of the industry. The most difficult part of the position was switching from the residential to commercial side of the industry. The most rewarding part of working for TycoIS was the ability to gain and share knowledge.
good,I got to meet new people everyday. My co-workers were great up to beat people.

good,"Lots of advancement opportunities.  Fairly laid back and, if you're a good employee that gives 110%, they take notice. Upper management wants to see you succeed and advance in their company."

good,Yo trabaje durante 13 años en la compañía y me senti muy comoda . Demostre ser comprometida y responsable . Tuve oportunidades de ascensos y mi experiencia fue muy buena. El motivo de mi desvinculación estuvo ligado a cambios estructurales en el área de cobranzas en el 2013. Pero realmente no tengo mas que palabras de agradecimientos para el equipo humano q demostraron ser a través de los años compartidos .
good,"It was great working there will always go back there again if I had the opportunity. The people is very supportive, loving and caring. You can build a futute by them."

good,Great company to work for I would go back in a heart beat if they were to have me. Best company I've ever worked for and co workers became like family
good,The atmosphere is always fun and positive. Great pay. Room for advancement always. This company thrives on taking care of their associates to ensure that the associates take care of customers.
good,"Productive office with great people and support. Very competitive commission structure offers additional recognitions, benefits, and rewards available after just 30 days from hired date."
good,Learned a lot of tools to use in other jobs or in life. Bosses taught you how to work fast and very well. Most of the company was amazing but every job has that one person you have to deal with. All around great company.
good,"A typical day was busy, calls I coming and outside lines.  I learned to work with various types of managers and coworkers, learned how to work with coworkers and worked on accounting and sales contracts with others, completed work on schedule.   Culture was enjoyable, enjoyed the work.  I really cannot remember a hard part connected with this job."
good,"Enjoyed ADT in different roles, good staff and a very nice place to work "
good,"Had to keep productivity over 1.0 which means 1 full install a day and a service call most likely before end shift. Excessive drive time, driving over 4 hours a day and that's just the commute from work to home, most of the time we do 2 jobs a day. Coordination could have been better, multiple times I would pass other techs of the same Office on the freeway going opposite ways. Jobs could have been coordinated to the Techs home to reduce overpaying for drivetime."
good,"They had excellent training for each job you did. They had good customer"
good,great job nice enviroment a little bit of room to grow and succeed alot of pros but lots of cons to as well but overall was happy at the job and i worked there for two years

good,"Worked for ADT for 5.5 Years. Benefits were great. Earned vacation, time goes up according to how long you work for the company. Floating time off, Paid holidays provided you worked the day before and day after. Just a Good Fair company."
good,"Honestly ADT has been the best job I ever had. I felt important and they spoil there employees. I really do not want to leave, but they do not offer a work from home program. I recommend this job to almost anyone who meets qualifications. I worked at some major companies and ADT has been the best training I ever had. Even the first week I felt comfortable about what I was doing and performing job task right out the gate. The pay could be better due to what all Account Managers have to do. The commission is amazing you have the potential to make over 3,000 a month easy."
good,"Me gusto el trabajo en equipo, y la excelente comunicacion con sus superiores . Buen hambiente de trabajo que tambien permitian atender comodamente al cliente."
good,"Great company, very easy job as long as you can work with multiple systems / Dealt with only inbound calls everyday which can become overwhelming , but as long as you can keep up with the pace very easy job."
good,"I was the Sales Manager and the Purchasing Agent  . I handled  all the daily scheduling for the installers and the the sales staff.The hardest part of the job was that most appointments were in the evening and on weekends. So I would miss a lot of family time training new sales staff , or riding with current sales staff after all week of daily operations of the office.purchasing and receiving was a huge daily task and usually took all day."
good,Working for ADT has its advantages as well as its disadvantages. Overall its a good company to be employed by. Sometimes it's fast paced and at other times it's slow paced. They have excellent benefits and for the most part we are a family at ADT. There are some good genuine people employed by this company.

good,"Love the benefits and pay. Lots of Pros when working with this company 401k plan, PTO, Holidays and vacation. Cons constant change in management & Seat change."
good,"I loved what I done there, but some employees got away with not telling customers the whole truth when purchasing a security system, You have to be good with dealing with hard people when it comes to getting the info you need to get them to the right department, and to be able to give quotes, one quote doesn't exist, it goes by how many doors, windows, etc to give quotes, that's why the cost is high because of certain issues with ones home. Customers think it's a simple quote and with that , we need a lot of info to give correct quotes to install the security system that best fits them."
good,there work culture was ok nothing exceptional about working at adt but it was a decent experience. cant say i would  not recommend them as a place to work
good,"This is by far one of the best company to work for. Everyone was very relaxed, very laid-back environment. The workplace seemed family oriented, and anyone would help you if needed. They provided free catered lunches at times when they hit a certain quota, and when you needed to call off from work they never penalized you or said no. There were days that I called the office manager to tell her that I wouldn't be able to make it in that day, and she would just say ""Okay, thank you for calling in and letting me know"". If I could/was given the option, I would've stayed and continued working for this company, but my position was only temporary."

I enjoyed being able to help people and interact with a wide diversity of individuals.

good,"great environment - fun place to work; lots of benefits; "
good,"I enjoyed working at the company at first but you have a lot of tenure people that get their.  If your not in the ""good old boy network"". What you do will be looked at loosely.  Compared to someone more senior.  Upper management is a job. If they dont like you they will try and make your life a living nightmare. Everyone rotates from one center to another so if your new to adt watch out if your not liked or management likes someone you do or dont. Beware of people you trust there are lot of snake in the grasses in theccompany especially management."
good,"Stay focused regardless of what was taking place.  Ways help others achieve success.  Varying levels of knowledge, commitment, expertise and talent.

The every day experience of dealing with customer issues and concerns and providing adequate resolution."

good,Answer phone calls from field sale reps and then input the information they provide. There is also batch work which consists of scanned in contracts which we verify the information to make sure it was inputted properly. I've learned new systems and have gained customer  experience. I can honestly say I love my co workers and managers. They are all very helpful and help the eight hour shift go by  smoother and faster. The hardest part is that not all the reps that call in are fully prepared which makes it difficult to get through the call.
good,"Vernos con el grupo en un sitio establecido para ver que zonas podemos hacer ese dia y dividirnos,"
good,"On a typical day, I would take around 100+ calls assisting customers with their billing issues. If they needed to make a payment, I was the person on the other end of the line that made that happen for them and made sure they were happy with my service. In paying their bills, it ensured their security services would not be interrupted."
good,I would enter data into the computer and when I was finished with my work I would ask the manager if she had anything else for me to do. I often helped others and trained the new employees. I got along well with the management and co-workers.
good,"Coordinated commercial installs at the corporate level. Held weekly conference calls for projects. Assisted the Project Manager where needed, Assisted the Team Manager where needed. Coworkers were serious about their work but yet had fun.

good,Great place to work. Great work/life balance. End of month can be super busy but I feel that the company takes care of their employees. Room for advancement and leadership does help get you where you want to be.

good,"Great company to work for! "
good,My time at ADT was challenging but could rise to those challenges. ADT is an employee friendly environment with excellent benefits and plenty of one on one time with supervisor to review and assess job progress.

good,"not bad was good learned a lot of things "
good,"Typical day, is when I had to discipline a supervisor for admin work  that he did not submit because he was a very good worker at that point and time. What I learned, is not to let my emotions get the upper hand of me. Management, was a pleasure to work with them. Culture, the work culture was from such a extend that we that worked their was a big family. Hardest part, is when I had to go and view a guard that was killed.

Also functing different windows and computer screens at once always taking notes making sure important informatin is logged in and saved following step by step procedures on alarms so we did have to be able to multi task at very fast pace in this enviornment. Every alarm is different so every alarm is handled differently. I had to transfer some calls to different departments after the alarm was handled, provide additional information that is needed and resolving any comlpaints. We had to handle 15 alarms per hour. We had to make sure we used our main manner words verbatim such as Mrs. Ms. Mr. please and thank you, good morning, good after noon, good evening eb very apologetic and sympathetic very understanding. I learned how to work well under preassure in a very fast paced enviornment. I liked everything about this job I do not have any complaints they taught me well to do that job I signed up for."

My co-workers were like family, I looked forward to seeing them daily. Last but not least, the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying our customers."
good,adt was a great company to work for but life balance was a little difficult
good,It's a great opportunity working for an ADT Authorized Dealer. I have reinforce my ability to work under pressure and lead others in the company.
good,"El café es gratis, la comida muy rica, nutritiva,  económica, el ambiente laboral es muy bueno, es una excelente empresa,  me gustaría regresar a trabajar ahí."
good,Put you on the phones too quick. Other call centers give more classroom time b4 classroom phone exercises. Dont feel comfortable with this. Very intimidating.
good,"The office I worked in was family.  Not ""like"" family, but family.  It made it easy to go to work everyday.  EVERYONE works hard and there may be high expectations, but the environment made it much easier to meet those expectations.  As the install coordinator, I worked closely with all departments.  I worked hard to ensure fairness for the install techs."
good,"ADT was a set schedule.  Overtime wasn't critical,  Commercial and residential installers were very knowledgeable and would take the time to share their knowledge."
good,The work is challenging. There are lots of opportunities for advancement. The environment is standard. The people are great and management is dedicated to your success.
good,Working for ADT was great and it helped me to develop a lot as a person by placing me on leaner ship and empowering me to become a better person. I learned things that I had never done before like chairing and initiating hearing those were great moments for me.
good,So far alright company pay is not that great. Nice  starter for young people looking for work and hungry to sell..  I don’t wanna work Sundays. This is for you
good,ADT Security has been a great company for over 100 years.  A long history of treating their employees right and providing great customer service.  Everyone is friendly and the culture is very inclusive.  Not many companies around that can claim those attributes.
good,The culture was amazing the pay raise is all based on how hard you are willing to work  and if you work hard you WILL be rewarded for the most part management is wonderful my manager recently passed and she was AMAZING. I was fired due to running out of unexcused absensce however I am thankful for the experience and people I meet there if I could start all over I would.
good,"This is a great place to work.  There is a lot of collaboration and team spirit.  They have lots of fun things going on all the time; contests, games, pizza day, pajama day."
good,Very fast paced but rewarding for an experienced sales person. Security is a great field with an ever expanding market. Off two days a week and good hours during the week. Would recommend to any sales person with a professional attitude.
good,I enjoyed installing alarm installation for 10 years. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I enjoyed being asked to transfer to a different location and drive 2 hours round trip just to do installs.
good,"I would receive our work orders on our mobility device the evening before our installations.  If I had the required parts on my van then I would head straight to the customers location from home.  If I didn't have the required parts we would pull them from the office warehouse.  I would then call each customer to give them a time frame as to when to expect us that way they aren't sitting around while they could be off running errands.  Once at the customers location I would do a walk through to determine the best location for each security device or placement of cameras to be installed.  Many of the systems had home automation devices such as being able to control light switches, locks and many other devices so we would have to at times coordinate with an electrician or locksmith for proper installation.  Once installed I would send signals to the central monitoring station and get confirmation that they received signals from each security device.  On almost ever CCTV system the customer would prefer to have the capability of having remote view which would allow them to access their cameras from almost any mobile device.  That would require us to network their DVR/NVR to their local network.  I would then give a thorough education on how to properly use their system and access their remote view.  "
good,"The expectation of the ADT Management TEAM is that everyone gives their all and if you do give your all then you will be a success at ADT. I truly enjoyed working with ADT. "

Great promoting opportunities. Great pay. Employee discounts. Only downside is the attendance policy, it's a little more strict that anywhere else... Cannot miss days unless you have vacation EVEN if you plan and take the days off ahead, there is no possiblity of that. Once your vacation time is done, you're done for pretty much. Because any additional time missed counts against you. Not friendly for a single mom perhaps or anything like that."

Being able to control the amount of money I want to make was very interesting to me.  Reason I say that is because ADT was my first job that is strickly commission based.  So the though of making as much money as I want and putting the effort to make it was a thrill.  My management is wonderful along with the co workers who help me succeed with this business.

Room for advancment, and lots of allowance for projects and committees.  "
good,"As a previous employee of ADT Security Services, I believe that they are an amazing company to work for. They have amazing benefits, the staff is very friendly and helpful when needed. The main focus of the job was to take inbound calls from customers and technicians and help them as best as possible.

I mean amazing benefits, time off, discounts and perks for working there. Along with having a gym on site (with showers), deli daily except weekends, .25 cent soda and free Starbucks coffee, tea etc. Plus giant bean bags in the lounge/lunch room area (fits 3/4 people easy on one lol) and the desks moved up and down for you and you had your own desk not to share. Even a computer on a treadmill you could schedule for an hour at a time if you wanted and felt like you needed to move around. Even scheduling time off was the best way and process I'd ever seen or dealt with and fast responses too for their system.

I take alarms until my first scheduled break, break for 15 minutes then continue alarms until lunch or until meetung times. After lunch the day tends to fly by. I've learned to manage my time well to always meet my production goals. The hardest part about the job was getting an alarm calling the clients and not getting a response. So I didnt know if the client was ok or not. The most enjoyable part would be the different events we would have such as Ice cream socials, RNR time etc."

good,"A typical day at work would be everyone working hard and doing what is required of them to do. I learned that you must work hard and have confidence in yourself. managment there was amazing , in order to be a good manager you must be a good leader. The workplace culture was very intimidating at first,but then I gained what I had to which was a strong I can do it mind set.The hardest part of the job was going up aginst people who were there for years  or months even weeks before me and feeling like I wouldnt do as good as they did ,in some cases that was true,but when I got better in most cases that didnt imply. Last but not least the most enjoyable part about the nob was when everyone gave you that feelking of wanting to come back to do even better than you did the day before and theyll also encourage you to do even more than you thought you could do..And that little bit of doubt you had in yourself you replace that with faith in yourself. and you ,dont have to worry about anyone bringing you down because you know that they had the same downfall as you had."
good,Positive work environment the best I have seen yet. Not a numbers stricken place they still want to see you perform. But they are more about what you do not how you do.
good,"Every day I went to work I knew I would by dealing with technicians out in the field needing my assistance in setting up or updating customer security account services. Which half the time would be assisting in troubleshooting device component issues either not initializing correctly or correcting signaling errors. I was happy to learn how to help with troubleshooting technical issues over the phone because that is what I feel I am best at helping with. Management was terrific in helping me learn how to be more effective in assisting technicians within a timely fashion while using the tools provided to me. The work environment was great to me because of the set guidelines, policies and procedures given to everyone equally to follow. I feel I do better when I know upfront what to expect in any situation because I like set rules that apply to everyone to follow. The only thing I ever felt was the hardest part of my job was if I had a troubleshooting problem that I wasn't able to fix. Typically I was very good at helping almost every time and being so fast that I was often complimented on how technicians wished they could get me every time they had a problem. Which that also made that one of the things I loved the most about my job along with how easy going the majority of the technicians were. It made me look forward to going in to work everyday."

good,"I've enjoyed a long and illustrious career with Adtek Security. It started as an unfulfilled need. The loss inherent in any food service establishment. It was consuming my profits at a voracious rate. The loss prevention industry coined it an innocuous term ""shrinkage"". I'm sorry but my profit dollars were not just shrinking, they were evaporating at an ever increasing rate! If something wasn't done my Subway Restaurants would surely fail. So Adtek was formed to address a simple issue. Food is the universal pilferable commodity. Everybody can use it. Customers always want more for free, employees consume it on site, steal it or sell it out the back door. Vendors short stock it. Rodents and insects vie for their fair share. Even mother nature takes it back if you don't manage it properly! Forget to regrigerate a freshly made pan of seafood and crab mix and it will be maggots by tomorrow. The problem was that Subway Franchisees are overworked just trying to cover a portion of their open hours. They are the lowest paid entrepreneurs in the food service industry, barely netting $18k a year from each store. Well below the poverty level. When you see a 50 year old man in an apron behind the cash register, that's the owner earning minimum wage on top of his anemic profits just to keep his family fed. Done there, been that. So being an analytic thinker, I reasoned the solution was to cover unmanaged shifts with artificial intelligence. Of course that didn't exist in the 80's so I improvised. I fabricated little gizmos to give the then state of the art time lapse VCR based video surveillance"

The only thing I didn't like about the job is that we got paid off commission although the pay was great but on some days we would work a whole day for free.But other than that it was a good place to work."
