rating,review
bad,"I worked for this company and walked out one day with about three other people. 8 People walked out that week alone. The supervisor running my shift and department would literally tell you to go ask someone else if you had a question. He would sit at his desk and play solitaire on his computer. I tried going above him to discuss the problems I had there only to be targeted by him. He tried getting me fired multiple times. I tried to talk to upper management about it only to be ignored, which lead to my decision to leave."
bad,"Medical issues that were not taken seriously. FMLA was sent in by my Dr. but not put in my personnel file by HR. Was fired for sleeping, but was actually having seizures. Blocked my unemployment, no insurance, no income for a year. Have since been awarded SSID for this issue. Things that make you go hmmm...."
bad,"This place sucks, Management plays favors. Busted my buns there for months just to get a .35 raise a YEAR. Most times you don't know if you're leaving work early or working your normal shift. I would start early and leave 4 hours into my shift. Someone is always getting injured."
bad,They work you like dogs with low pay rate been there 2 years and only 80 cent raise and they dont appreciate your hard work but chew you up and expect more
bad,Ryder could be a positive place if they bring in the right management team. The working environment is negative with little to no support from management. My experience was horrible.
bad,Don’t waste your time . The department is run by buffoons that have never worked in a call center a day in their lives so they have absolutely NO CLUE  what they are doing. It’s an unorganized mess and Ryder Assist Now especially was not thought through before executed. Period
bad,Horrible work place. Some B.s. every other day. Can't even work by yourself because they would be watching you for you to miss up. The reason why I left
bad,Used abused and all rude. Most workers are lazy. Yearly reviews are not good. Trust me. Don't work for these. Alcoholic boss that used to get jealous of people relationships. All liars. Wasted a year of my life working with these idiots. No career progression. And need a class 1 licence to work for 18 k a year haha comics
bad,Working with this company all seems well but the management is horrible and unconventionally and unethically racist  and that is all tread at your own will
bad,"Management is by far the biggest joke ever in Warehouse history "
bad,Boss is rude and ignorant does not appreciate anything you do only wants trucks fixed you will never do anything right in his eyes does not listen to anything you have to say throws his wait around when non employees. Are in the shop
bad,"I would not recommend Ryder to anyone EVER. You are just a number at Ryder. When they want you out, you’re OUT. No love at Ryder. I would recommend working in the sewer before Ryder."
bad,"Diversity is not a problem at Ryder. That’s the only good thing I can say about them. Tenure, knowledge base and seniority means nothing to this company. The pay is not even close to fair for the work that is expected. There is no job security. If you get sick you will lose your job. If you have a family, they are never to take precedence over your job under any circumstances, or you will lose your job. Safety is preached, but not practiced."
bad,"Long hours, lousy pay and not picking just itching to fire you!!!"
bad,If you a crackhead this the job for you. I know crackhead work up there and get high and drive a truck. This what Ryder got on their highway driving truck.
bad,Upper management and supervisor team gossips and gets involved with the Forklift drivers on the floor. HR is never available or not willing to speak with people. Favoritism and friendships comes before the work and the importance of the flow of operations. The Ops Manager is prejudice and does not focus on the sole purpose of the business nor does he have the education for the role he is in. They do not care about family and outside life
bad,"The turover rate is very high and reviews dont lie. Job descriptions do not match or pay what the company is seeking.The work envronment is hostile and the management and single hr rep are very incompetent.You will"
bad,Unsafe environment and unorganized. Go through management every three months.  Only two management in charge of 80+ drivers. Unable to take time off if an emergency because lack of staff to follow up.
bad,Lets start by saying the work is easy coworkers all get along but the management is a joke they dont care about you they mandate you without 24 hour notice I quit because they were mandating 5-6 days every week because productivity was low and was not producing enough  to what they were agreeing to with the customers they installed a new system and it is terrible!!! it hasnt done anything but slow everything down!!!! dont try to fix something that isnt broken! I worked the night shift so the hr never stayed over if you needed to ask anything and she never gives a direct answer to any questions she SHOULD have the ANSWER to and thinks workers have the mind of a 5 year old she always says let me ask the manager or ops manager what she should tell us to things she should already know the answer to! also by far the worst inventory ever!!! the inventory manager is always on vacation and never fixed not one inventory issue since I been there and the GM and ops manager have no idea on how to run a warehouse operation!!!!! they also promote people who do the least work and promote supervisors who assault employees which should be immediate termination!!!!!! but management and hr hides it!!! favoritism in my eyes!! overall this job was turned into a nightmare it was once good when I started but I moved on DONT WORK HERE if you have kids or have a life because you wont see them ever or you will never enjoy yourself you'll be too busy getting mandated 5-6 days every week while management enjoys their days off!!! they really don't care about their employees who actually keep them a job!!!
bad,"Ryder does not care about office employees. Human Resources does not know how yo listen to complaints and/or management concerns and questions.  Human Resources says they will investigate any issue, complaint, or problem from both parties and the do not."
bad,"Ryder braford"
bad,"I would never advise anyone to work at Ryder ,,,was a terrible experience .. They don't respect the employees , management is never available for questions or help with anything"
bad,"There are a lot of areas that they need to work on especially with upper management, and the hr department, worked there for a few years and if you weren't pretty or dressed a certain way then you weren't promoted."
bad,"This is a terrible company don’t waste your time, they have rude dispatchers  and low pay. One dispatcher a fat undesirable low energy fat whale of a pig will make your life miserable because her life is miserable"
bad,"A typical day at work would be putting in eight hours ONLY to be told you need to stay four hours more right at the end of your shift!!! If you can't work twelve hours on a regular basis and you are a ""new hire"" they will release you immediately!!! If you happen to last sixty days and get into the union, which is a joke, then it's a ""hit and miss"" situation but you will be working some twelve-hour shifts, like it or not!!!"
bad,Find a better job they racist and treat they employee's like trash im looking for a better job now they need to fire the management team and it would be a better place to work.
bad,"Worst company in the world, don’t waste you time, the dispatchers or rude and the pay is low, that will over work you they pay zip code to zip code beating you out of hundreds of miles a week"
bad,Dead end job.  Exploited people and took advantage of hard-working and dependable people trying to move up and secure their employment.  Don’t follow-through with promises or back up their words of encouragement.
bad,Management take favorites and run new drivers like a dog to cover for senior drivers. This company would be great if they changed Management. I've been with the company for 4mths and I'm already looking for a new job.
bad,management first off just the worst i have ever seen at any previous warehouse. Never have a solid answer for any question you have and treat you like you have the education of a elementary school student. If your a competent worker might was well just delete the resume now unless you like watching other employees that do half the work you do get promoted. management commits to a contract that they cant produce and just want to write and harass employees cause they cant make productivity  even though it is impossible with the new system they added..
bad,"Poor management, you have to do a mechanics job plus you have to run and get parts. Still have to stay punched on the job. So trying to make time is impossible. Very poor."
bad,Do not work for Ryder Flagstaff the managment is an absolute joke they put some kid in charge and he doesn't have the first idea about driving a truck 1200 a week is to low for the high priced Flagstaff area they have crappie equipment the Flagstaff yard has a 95% turn over rate it's a joke
bad,I worked there for a year And a half always preaching about harassment and bullying and that’s all the manager would ever do is threaten your pay threaten write you up for any little thing even if you didn’t watch the video She threaten to write you up.
bad,"These guys suck.  They lie, then they micro manage you.  Plus follow you around while you drive and pick on every move you make. I wouldn't recommend working for Ryder at all. Stay away from Ryder."
bad,A very bad company that doesn’t listen to its employee in any ways . The politics in the company is just too much . Wrong supervisor and you get judge by the floor of the skin .
bad,"Noone cares if you want overtime, they wont give it to you. Dont care is your sick, regardless of the freezing temps. Coats dont do it anything when your in a fridge more then 8 hours"
bad,Not great place I would not recommend this bs at All manager is very rude I hate it here you will be hot asf I don’t recommend unless you need a job bad
bad,They do not help nobody with nothing. I have poor customer service bathroom is never clean and we cannot bring bottled water inside the building. They do not have a good manager team leader
bad,Management is very poor there. Rules were changing every day. Always had to work weekends. Hourly rate wasn't that good. Everyone had a  poor attitude
bad,"Management are inept people,  and they  micromanage drivers who are overworked and underpaid."
bad,"Overall I would not recommend anyone to work for ryder. The manager I had, falsely terminated me and I sued them and won! So, I would not recommend them to anyone!!!!"
bad,I worked 18 years for them . I missed only 2 scheduled shifts due to sickness and as a driver I never had any accidents or any other issues. They terminated me without any warning or valid reason other than the fact that I didn’t play politics like many of the coworkers . Horrible place to work and poor management . The HR department will always side with the location manager.
bad,"CVS Acct in Orlando Fl,,those rollers used were Worn Out,,that Ryder Manager was always disrespectful, Never honest, Cheated your Paychecks,but Alot of Work,if your '''CHEAP LABOR''''."
bad,Upper management is very unprofessional.  No breaks. You are constantly being micro managed.  No appreciation. Health care doesn't  pay for anything.  They expect way to much and have their favorites.  Upper management enjoyed belittling people and lived for causing additional stress to people beneath them
bad,No work life balance at all. Management will bleed you dry and then come back for more.  Salary positions are worked to exhaustion and Operations Manager talks down to everyone yet has never driven a forklift or loaded a trailer.
bad,"They hired a new manager with the only interest was to fire everyone for nothing at all. He lacked people skills, he hated the drivers but dispatch could do no wrong"
bad,Working in management you will never have a fair work environment. The leadership are afraid that if you do something that they can't take credit for they do not want you there.
bad,"Horrible management, you are not a supervisor you are an upgraded dispatcher.  They will lie to have you terminated, Human Resources is a joke.  No protection for employees, they are there to protect the company.  Management allows bullying, harassment and once reported retaliation starts."
bad,Find something else this is the worst company out there. Nobody on management care even to have their own trucks legally documentation. No service on trucks and nobody want to spend money on their own equipment even less on fuel or drivers.
bad,Management at Ryder is ridiculous. They have double standards and play favoritism. They do not provide adequate training in order to do the job. They expect supervisors to cover 3-4 jobs at once but then want to discipline the supervisor when something slips through the cracks when the supervisor is spread too thin.
bad,I experienced racist talk got called monkey supervisor very rude treat u like a kid supervisor had they picks HR pointed employees out she don't like they didn't care about no one I recommend nobody work there or DHL it's all the same great employees
bad,"I was Hired 12/17/2018 and laid off with No Return date, Because Ryder Hired A Temp that put me out of Work. Why would Ryder Hire me??!! Not Fair  so now I am still looking for Work as A CDL B, P Driver. I was working @ York H-Vac Co. The Guys was Cool As  Bug But Ryder is Fake As Bug."
bad,Management is all about themselves and dont support the employees.  Long hours and make you work weekends for no reason at all.  Just an awful place to work
bad,Dishonest management that will aways be trying to short you on your  pay and expectations are for you to not say anything about it. One of the cheapest and dumbest  on logistics in trucking.
bad,Worked out of Cambridge for 9 years and the best day was my last day. Don't waste your time. They don't care about their equipment spend more time on the side of the road then driving. Hard work for low pay and never any thanks. All you are is a number.
bad,"The Union does nothing to help you, but they will gladly take the admission for them out every month to put in their pocket as they do not even follow their constitution preamble. The list within the first pages of their book, with the UAW book, is not followed. In return, management walks all over you, even if you're a Veteran. They will not let you return to work if you get hurt because of random senseless reasons they will come up with, so it can be an excuse to not pay you. When you are out, they want you to use your vacation days instead of getting workers compensation. They will not accommodate you for any reason since they just want who they want, they are not about any family."
bad,They do not promote from within .they bring in people who know nothing about what we do. Most managers know far less than the front line staff. Its really at the point of being a joke. Sometimes I wonder how things still operate.Most staff look for something better once they figure out common sense does not apply at Ryder.
bad,This is worse company to work for they are racist and there's a lot of favoritism they promote who they want worst management and corporate works for them selves not for the employee  if you have an issue with anything and you call corporate thinking they are going to help you they are not they use what you say against you and get you fired ....
bad,"To much information and expectations to know.  Everyone says it takes 3-4 months to know everything, yet expects a wk to understand.  No work professionalism, everyone curses. Not even enough desks for employees.  This place is a joke.  Shortage of drivers, disputes between every department and more."
bad,I enjoyed workinh at ryder most of the time but mangement waant fair to certain races the have favortism all lot and bulling by their. Lead mangers and get away with it very stressfull to stay on working
bad,they pay was not enough and the staff and managnment were good. i did not like working there. to many petty women on the job and being nosey and not working enough
bad,They fired me because my vehicle broke down and I couldn't afford a tow truck or mechanic to show them a receipt and they wouldn't take the paper work of the new car I'm renting as a good enough reason again for only missing 2 days of work when I could name people that have missed over a week and still have there job and they claimed if u call there call in number that u will be covered but that was a lie
bad,"Management doesn't know what they are doing at all, almost everyone in management has never drove a truck and they don't understand drivers or know how long it can take to go from point A to point B and the fact that it can vary depending upon traffic and the day of the week, and they don't pay overtime and their equipment is complete trash and they lie a whole lot they made me a lot of promises they didn't keep, stay away"
bad,Very stressful environment management does not care about the employee's. I worked there for 3 years and only received one raise of 44 cents. Very long days when it benefits the company. Micro Management at its best!!!  This work place is a revolving door They changed management almost 10 times in 3 years... no job security if you stand up for yourself. They want you to fear them as if they are Superior to you.
bad,"I was hired into the Used Vehicle Warranty Department. I'm underpaid and it's a lot of drama. The supervisor is very unprofessional. "
bad,"first I was hired  to be in Iowa division home daily in three cities Davenport, Cedar Rapids and Waterloo/Cedar Falls first 3 weeks "
bad,The management shows favoritism towards some people and treat other employees like they don’t belong. They do not keep Human Resource matters private and also gossip about the employees
bad,I have never worked for an inept company in my life. The upper management tries to make people mad to get them to quit. They force people to do jobs they are not supposed to be doing. HR department does nothing to help employees. Workers call he hot line because they were told to get to work and there feelings were hurt. They constantly claim racism any time a different race tells them to do something. The HR department always brings in and grills you about being racist. Company just gave up and said they can't do job find someone else to do it. They lost 4 other accounts in the past year so they must. Be awful everywhere.
bad,"Poor management ,"
bad,Management is bad there they are not prepared for there people and change thing as they go wasn't a good experience they need to be more steady and organized
bad,"There. Communication sucks geo tap is a joke they hire their dispatchers to become managers they dont l"
bad,Very garbage company work for! invades your privacy while in trucks.....shares your personal info with other company drivers. pay always behind. very shady company … staff seem to be holding some secret scandle.
bad,"Manager and Supervisor are a major joke. The have their favorites. If you are a Cherry Picker, look out if you just touch a rack by accident there is no written warnings at all. They get rid of you right away. They cant keep no one at all. The good workers that do good work they get rid of stupid stuff. A guy came down on another employee he didnt get fired the guy on the ground did...that is so wrong. The guy came down on him moving in reverse hydroplaning which you arent allow to do. I guess certain ones are allow to break rules. The supervisor favorite. This place stay away. OSHA probably be involved on that . Worse place for employment.  The muslims are there cant speak Englis either,  they dont understand the employees what they are trying to tell them. They will walk right in your path like they can do what they want. Management knows this also. They arent about saftey at all they say they are but that all a lie."
bad,You had to be at work at 3:30 in the morning to unload and load up your truck filled with copiers. You would have to drive sometimes hundreds of miles one way just for one stop. Pay was okay hours were long
bad,Ryder Construction was not a good company to work for many people when they get hired they usually leave very early in the stage of the projects. The company hires and fires people regularly.
bad,"not really a place you eat to work if you are wanting a career, this is just a dime a dozen warehouse job, not very good management at all, ducks with heads chopped off.  no leadership. no advancement.  internal politics like many other places of same caliber.  just pass"
bad,The managers are incompetent children. It's all Vietnamese and African who most of them speak no English at all so being trained is extremely stressful. Onsite lunch food is from a vending machine and will always make you sick.
bad,"Ryder does not hire you on, employees have been working for years and they don't get hired on, they expect you to be full part of Ryder but they don't hired you on their excused that its not in their budget. the management is very unfair. a lot of favoritism, a place where you are not value as an employee. Ryder expects things done a certain way but we were not provided with the actual equipment to do so."
bad,"Very disorganized, Dispatch is absolutely incompetent. management isn't much better. Only pay overtime to class 1 drivers after 60 hours a week. Benefits are ok but employees pay for them. If you are thinking of a career with Ryder I strongly suggest punching your self in the face it will be less painful then working for these clowns. They will cut your hours with zero notice and leave you hanging. scheduling is done the day before so you never know what you are doing ahead of time. They will send you out of town and run you over your allowed driving hour when ever they feel like it and won't care if you are screwed. Slip seating, and if you get to work and they send you out over night on zero notice you will not at all be prepared for a over night trip. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST COMPANY IN THE WORLD TO WORK FOR."
bad,"Ryder can be a fun place to work at, but not as a temp.  Which is what I am at the moment.  Idon't know the benefits that are provided by Ryder nor do I know the salaries at Ryder.  I liked dispatching trucks and I also liked the employees that I worked with."
bad,"they don’t know how to treat people at this job, management is rude. They don’t care about nobody but their selves. Worse management ever. I don’t recommend this job at all"
bad,"The culture is awful.No overtime pay at all.There’s a clique type atmosphere.Also a High turnover rate for new employees. Experienced techs please don’t apply here . The pay rate is laughable, they even give you an extra dollar for working/staying at the location in Jefferson because no one ever stays . The culture is so horrible at that location from my experience, because of the employees that have been there over 20 years , they have an “old dog Mentality” . Everyone knows that mechanics don’t make money unless you make overtime. There’s a huge sign on the clock in screen saying “no overtime” . They even asked me what’s the lowest I could start for, in the job interview. I have to admit however the recruiter did an excellent job sugar coating this place. But ask yourself if a job was so great why would they have to entice future employees with a “sign on bonus “ which was a lie. They’ll tell you and advertise 5k but it’s really 2k and it’s paid over a year.  So you don’t even get the full amount.  This company was a waste of time. And I’ve read many negative things about this Particular location on social media even while I was an employee here as brief as it was before I couldn’t take it anymore this place is not the answer , for your sake look elsewhere. !!! Not to even mention there is zero place to work on trucks here in the shop I’ve had to work on trucks outside in the rain and cold .  NO LIE . If you get called for an interview and you still don’t take my word for any of this ask for a tour of the shop. And you’ll feel the tension and get a hold of how pitiful this"
bad,In writing anything for this review as it doesnt really pertain to what I am trying to do at this point in time. Ridiculous to make someone fill this out.
bad,terrible management in a cut-throat environment.  they have a CEO that is completely attitudinal.  they do not look out for the employees what so ever.
bad,I got let go for no reason at all so that place wasn't able to get me what I needed so sorry but I have to they are no longer interested me so I have nothing to say about them
bad,Feels like high school. Cubes everywhere. No real training. Hard to be clear on what you are supposed to be doing. Most management is rude and unapproachable.
bad,don't work poor management lack of communication managers don't work people talk bad about you lack of work poor environment not parts talk big but show nothing
bad,"Learned nothing. "
bad,"No one is for the employee, you are totally alone.  You contract for a company, so management is not on your side.  You do all the hard work while management get all the quarterly bonus, while you get nothing."
bad,"Can not trust no one, the open door policy clearly does not work.. To be promoted you had to really suck up it did not count how much effort you put into the position."
bad,"you are told to perform unsafe work and when you refuse they stop giving you work management are lost and confused "
bad,I don't recommend no one to work here. The management is very poor as well as the human resource department. It is very very hot in there this time of the year and they have very few fans to support the heat. My experience there was not good at all.
bad,Corporate has no idea of what is happening at each shop.  Its a number game make your numbers at all cost. DOT could put their trucks out of service as they leave the shop after being service and a federal annual done. HR is a joke...
bad,"Employees with low production scores were sent home so they had to use up their vacation time to make a 40 hr week. Employees that had issues with management were cut out before their down time was inserted . Production goals are figured on an 8 hr day as if they are working through all their breaks. Rack inspections are not up to date and any spills are by employees are blamed on them. Managers put extra work loads on the supervisors they want to get rid of. Shaming in public is what managers do to increase production . Facility manager tells management staff if they do not hit the unrealistic goals put out they will work the weekend and unload and load trucks while he rides his motorcycle all weekend. Managers bully and make inappropriate jokes at others expense to intimidate and control other people under them. Fear of being fired daily is what you have to deal with . Managers fire people that have low numbers and reward unsafe behavior if you preform well. Lean projects are padded to make the customer feel that the facility is saving money.operations manager curse the employees out and fear of retaliation makes employees unable to bring the issue to the HR department. Employees are asked to do personal favors for the managers. If you say no you are ignored and ridiculed until you agree to the terms set by upper management. The environment is hostile . An employee sued the company and all management was told this person was not allowed overtime for over a year, When the individual was given overtime the supervisor that gave the overtime was threatened with termination. Employees"
bad,"If you want to work for a company who doesn’t care about its employees, works them until they leave on stress, and make you wish for a car accident so you don’t have to go there...then this place is for you."
bad,I worked there for 10 years. After 8 years you top out. There is no cost of living raise. Employees are favored which leaves others not getting overtime or travel they need. Management is unfair in many areas. They yell and embarrass employees.
bad,"I was there for one day and received next to no training to do my job. When I requested an accommodation per federal law (Change in equipment per the ADA act), they IMMEDIATELY fired me."
bad,management never around when u needed them. sat in office all night and u might of seen them 2 or 3 times in a 12hr shift. management with no real skills. bad operations at work got supplies to do ur job 1 day then next day wasnt any supplies. machines that break down 24/7 with no real crew to fix anything properly. machines rigged to run. no ventilation and poor atmosphere and bad working conditions 120+ degrees inside the warehouses.
bad,"Same daily routine route local run. Required handling of both full and empty racks, loaded and reloaded of the trailer physically with no help from equipment."
bad,"i dont like working for ryder the management seems like they dont know what their are doing, they dont help you when you have person issue outside of work."
bad,Manager continually let everyone know he had a Masters and really did look down on anyone who did not. The moral was as low as it could get. Eventually people started leaving due to the current management and is condescending attitude.
bad,"Title says it all. It has been years since my employment here, but I sincerely doubt that has changed anything. I would be hard pressed to recommend this as even a starting position"
bad,"I've  been driving a truck for Ryder for 20yrs. I bring home less money today than I did when I started. On my account we (drivers) have had 3 raises in 16yrs. That's 3 cents per mile more than 16yrs ago. I witnessed our district manager say that he didn't care about the drivers and we were a dime a dozen. That's what Ryder thinks about it's drivers, and it shows. Don't come to work here if you think your going to better yourself. If you need a job and they are hiring, well go ahead and take it. But don't fall in love with them, because they will break your heart."
bad,Did not like having to be on call for break downs anytime of the night. Had to take care of customers on the fuel island which became so frequent that you couldn’t get your actual tasks and jobs done on time. Management refused to address the issue. Lowest pay amongst other companies.
bad,"ryder is way to strict on attendance, if your 2.9 seconds late they are yelling down your throat. I personally went through it and so did many other people that worked with me there as well have put up with it,  it is stressful and dreadful to wake up thinking ryder I do not recommend to anybody to work at ryder"
bad,High turnover due to poor management. Terrible work environment. Management intimidation. Inconsistent goals and expectations. Favoritism. Work conditions were poor. Old building with bad a/c and heating
bad,Working for Ryder is one of the worst jobs out there. They never paid their workers what they should. They kept saying they were going to raise it but failed to do so . Job was terrible. Good place to get experience but not a place for setting down roots.
bad,"The enviornment is very fast paced, high stress, very high turn over, and very very long hours with zero consideration of your life outside of Ryder. Upper Management and HR is unsympathetic of you being overworked and very impersonal. In their eyes you are disposable, subhuman, and wouldnt hesitate to terminate you if you didn’t submit to their 60 hour work weeks. You will easily work 60+ hours a week and at the end of the month it will be close to 70 without any extra compensation (4-13 hour days, plus a mandated 5th 12 hour day, plus a mandatory weekly staff meeting that could land on your day off ). With those hours you will make less than the forklift operators (which isn’t much). Ryder offers nothing worth staying for. As a Customer Logistics Supervisor the hours are brutal, the health insurance is expensive, you have zero discretion, you get no breaks or a lunch, you are micro manged and ruled with an iron fist. Please consider other options unless you are truly truly desperate for a job."
bad,A typical day at work was terrible and not desirable at all. They were racist and unfair in all of the decisions they made. They were very unprofessional.
bad,Hurt on job. Supervisor ignored it. Dispatcher had no history in the trucking business. Forced to run illegally. Trucks not serviced properly and broke down often. Forced to do other routes outside of my normal.
bad,Come in put in  8 hours learned new routes had management over turn often the employees were always worried about cuts and or what would come next my dept. was fine we got our jobs completed and has no issues.
bad,This is a policy and management driven company.  All day we care about drivers but those are only words. Ryder cares about their managers and moving frieght. They talk all day about safety but that only matters when its convenient. If it puts manager in a bind then safety goes out the window. The pay is low . You will never advance and may get a raise every 2 or 3 years. Maybe. Basically you were warned.
bad,"you would pick up your truck bobtail the truck to Bunny Bread in north St. Louis accross the river in Ill.  Hook up to your loaded trailer and start your route. You would deliver bread to local stores in St. Louis area. It was hard work but rewarding. by the end of the week you were exhaused. You had over 22 stops to make in one night. I worked there for 6 months. The pay at the time was good, but the work was hard. Fast paced and keep you on your toes. Once all your deliveries were made you took the empty trailer to Bunny Bread drop it off and bobtailed back to Ryder to drop of the truck. then drive your car home and repeat it all over the next day. If I remember correctly they gave Tuesdays and Saturdays off."
bad,"Sucks from management down they lie they promise and dont come through they use their workers laid me off right before Christmas if anybody gets a job here dont put to much effort and use them before they use you.. "
bad,"Non team orientated atmosphere,  un educated unexperienced saff,more aguring and fighting between shifts than productivity,dog eat dog shop no help to new comers here.they know all"
bad,HR does nothing! Refers you to call a number or go to a website with your questions...at first it was 40 hour weeks but then all the halfwits and flunkees they hired couldnt keep up so the place kept falling behind...40 hour weeks turned into 66 and 77 hour weeks with little time off...if your injured they will not follow up with you whatsoever and make you feel like your a risk...horrific horrific place to work...period.
bad,Worst company to ever work for. They treat you like prison inmated. Fast pased work with no incentive to work harder. Unlimited hrs if you want them. Too many peopke who dont take pride in their job.
bad,"Poor management followed by stressful and racist environment. Disrespectful leadership, unprofessional, uncaring, overworking people. I would not recommend this job."
bad,"They prefer if your a minority,  whites are not at all encouraged for advancement. The most messed up computer system network I have ever seen! If your a self starter, the is not the place for you."
bad,"Worst place to work, they keep raising production to get rid of employees. you come under 99 or 98 percent your fired, no exception. management sucks."
bad,Backstabbing procrastinators The company will work you like a dog until you are worn out and then kick you to the curb all efforts exerted by employees to improve this corporation are not appreciated
bad,"This place totally sucks  snotty back stabbing management   , need home life what so ever.  Place is to scrict.  Way to particular place was just set up so bad every one Is leaving .to much High School drama."
bad,"Difficult to have all the departments on the same page, as they all have different quotas to meet. They did take pride in the appearance of the trucks."
bad,Ryder came in to our formerly cardinal logistics shop as a captive location in pearl river location. We all transferred  over  the contract you sign absolutely  don't mean anything  it was totally worthless  with in weeks it went down hill  the main cause was Bob Hollis  is a complete Moron  there is to many chief an not enough indians  different people were sent from various location to help with transfer which they were totally clueless to  imagine that  after being with cardinal for 3 yrs it's time to pack my bags. An move on
bad,"no onsite assistance, cooperation with their contractors is none. A typical day at work is that you had to worry about the equipment failing.  I did not enjoy going to work ,"
bad,One of the worst jobs I've ever had.it not a good place to work if you are looking to do the right things on your job. Everyone cuts corners and expects you to do the same even with customers.
bad,Terrible work place would work us 12hrs daily instead of the scheduled 8hr work day. Company could not keep employees so they would over work and threaten with termination those that would stay and work with them. breaks would be cut short and mandatory overtime was a common occurrence.
bad,"Terrible management. Supposed to be Union, but upper level jobs are handed out and not bid on and won fairly. Middle management has very poor choices in roles. All around joke."
bad,Do not work there for nothing ever ever ever ever ever managers don't know anything and work you over with no over time start at minimum wage and takes forever to hire you on
bad,The culture in Ryder's supply chain management area is poor. The only driving factor is money and employees do not matter. This place is a cancer and I can't wait to find something better.
bad,"Ryder do sent practice safety they expect you to move their trucks even if it's unsafe and management is just a title because they are pitiful and they are prejudice at the Shreveport,la location"
bad,it was a job that was a evolving door. no respect for anyone but the people that was there for a long time. and the supervisors are all racist. they treat black people with no respect.
bad,I think that this is a good company the money is always good and they have great trucks to drive. The McDonough branch is a problem though the management is not so great. One of the drivers was given a management position and they drove some of the drivers away. So stay away from McDonough but over all its a great place to work
bad,This place is ran by unqualified people who got their jobs because of who they know not by the skills they possoes. it was a very unprofessional experience
bad,"Ryder WAS a great place to work, until upper management fired and drove good people out with alot of years experience! They fired the wrong person............."
bad,"Treated employees unfairly, bad raises, no matter how good you do you still dont do enough always trying to find a fault you do wrong, management is never positive, always negative,  never no room for avancement."
bad,Management was horrible they took more time focused on peoples personal life than actually being a manager.. I wouldn't advise anyone to work at this company ever
bad,"not fair place to work at all"
bad,"Lower than average wages , unprofessional management and petty supervisors who think they're amazing but they don't know anything and low morale .. brag about their a Fortune 500 company but they're only that way from ripping off their employees. They don't put any effort or care into their business."
bad,"Management do not know what their doing, and pay is not great at all . job work life balance there is NO balance 12 hour shifts right now 6 days a week. But we are trying to cutback on overtime really!!!"
bad,"Management is a joke at this place of business. Go in do your job and that's it. Easier off not talking to any of the service managers. If you're second shift, good luck on getting anything done."
bad,"Poor management. Over loaded with work. Manager and supervisor gives too many locations to service. Greg Montgomery and Felecia Pugues both are incompetent, non understanding persons that contract for AT&T."
bad,Beware truck mechanics .low pay everywhere else starts at higher wages .this company wants to run the shop like a factory . Not good place for a good mechanic . I was there for 10 years and best day of my life is when I left
bad,They were great until they have to pay you for your one year raise then they find any reason to fire you. I even had unemployment open an investigation into their claim on  me for insuboardination and they deemed their information unreliable and not approved because it did not make sense to fire someone for.
bad,"this by far the worst company to work for, I get harassed by management because he was told by the lady in HR to harass me which is wrong on sooo many levels."
bad,Advertise for forklift operators but make u warehouse assoc. They hired the failures from other co. And made them superv.and leads DON'T WASTE UR TIME
bad,"These people will jerk you around and never give you what they promise.  They are Liars and will tell you things and do the opposite.  It is Not Full time employment, you will work when they need you."
bad,"typical day was getting orders, picking orders, didn't learned much from management co workers were great, there wasn't no enjoyable parts, it was just to help pay bills"
bad,"Management is totally disengaged, making it very difficult to get things done. There is a lack of strategy, systems documentation and direction. xxxxx"
bad,not the company for me.was treated bad..not enough good equipment to do job..i was cussed then fired..when i expressed my displeasure with that..and then
bad,What goes one day doesn't go the next. What one person gets in trouble for another doesn't. Deplorable management! They operate according to their own agenda rather than a set protocol. The bosses are biased and HR is inexperienced at best.
bad,Ryder sells themselves as being a solution provider in the transportation industry but in reality they have no clue about the transportation industry.
bad,there no balance everyone is treated like trash the pay sucks and the boss blame everything on the csc and the rental can do what ever they want. and if your a csc your under paid and get treated like trash
bad,this was one of the most mindless jobs I've ever seen. it was perfect all I had to do was wash 4 or 5 trucks a night and fuel up trucks.
bad,Company treats people wrong for what other people do to them. They don't give raises and they don't promote anyone they may not like.
bad,"management does not treat workers very good ,co-workers complane alot and alot of people come and go . the hardest partofthe job is picking numbers they want in a safe way"
bad,"When told the doors were closing, safety went out the window. Sups and co workers did what ever was not an SOP. What else is there more to say"
bad,"was promised to make 1000 a week never saw it bring home , total let down too many safety issues with pallet jacks brought to attention of supervisor made excuse's that everything was fine. Other drivers coming into work early am hungover and driving trucks tearing up new equipment."
bad,"Extremely stressful and negative environment, extremely high turnover rate. Management overlooks your actual job performance and only notices when you kiss their butts. They give you a 30 minute lunch break but its actually less because your break begins once they announce for you to go on break(yeah they have to give you permission to go on break rather go on break at a given time)and it takes you about 3-5 minutes to walk to clock out for lunch. The hours you work is terribly managed, you're scheduled to work 8 hours but they can change it to 12 hours off a whim the same day notifying you of the hours changing literally 2 hours before you're supposed to go home. Management is so focused on production numbers they literally ignore every other aspect of the job. The only good thing I got from that job is the fact i was never noticed by management and basically learned every aspect of every area in that warehouse. I could do their job now if i wanted to. Would never recommend someone to work for them, it is modern day slavery."
bad,"i have currently been employed with ryder for 9 years going on 10 and in that time we have only received two raises and one of those was 3% accross the board. so that means people who call in weekly and don't produce were rewarded the same as those who over achieve. the ability to advance is very limited to almost non existant. i run a area and have had numerous new employees come in and take breaks when they want for however long they see deemable and these same employees leave when they want and never call to inform anyone. and when management is notified there is nothing done. there is allot of favortism with a select few that get a run of the mill as far as pay and movement. we have people that tell management ""NO"" they will not do that on a regular basis. so all in all my experience working for ryder at applied materials has been a huge let down and the sad part is iv'e invested a large amount of time and hard work into this place with no reward in advancement or pay."
bad,Was not a good place to work at 1st time I wanted to complain they fired me they wanted me to work on my own time and then penalize me when I wanted to address the problem. Every driver is unhappy but wont stand up and say something they don't want to lose their jobs never had a meeting and never got an opportunity to go threw chain of command to address my problem which was the route I was giving was not doable without taking a lunch break and always going over H.O.S hours had to use my extra day driving in a hurry all the time put a stress and hardship on my life and if you didn't do the route in time they said they would penalize your pay.  That's just some of the problems Good luck!
bad,"40 k for 14 hours a day. That should tell you everything you need to know. They tell you what you want to hear in the interview and its all downhill from there. This is delivering milk for Deans Foods. You unload Giant, Six crates high, pallets of milk and dairy products which the plant never wraps and flies everywhere when driving leaving you to pick up, restack and rewrap at every stop, up to eight stops per day. Then pick up 7 crate high empties at the same time having to unload freight and reload to keep product in front and empties in back. 200.00 a day guaranteed for 14 hours a day of gruelling, bust your butt work outdoors in pouring down rain, sleet, snow and blistering hot or freezing temps. Sunday, Wednesday and Fridays off but are forced dispatched every Friday to other locations so you never fully are rested. Work holidays, no overtime, no extra pay for sitting hours in traffic or waiting 45 minutes each stop for an open dock. Nothing but 200 a day. You may get lucky and make 225 but thats few and far in between. Compensation is laughable at best.14.00 an hour is what you average. Worst job I have ever had."
bad,The ladies here spend more time smoking and gossiping than doing work. This happened everyday. I was also thrown into a position with absolutely no training.
bad,"No Life, To Cold, bad management, Coworker keep up alot of junk. Different shift are good thing. No a job for advancement"
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE. It is a bad company. They treat you like garbage, management sucks, no time for lunch or breaks. It's an easy job but you get no home life. I would never recommend this job to anyone. MAYBE my worst enemy."
bad,"If you are looking for a place with no stability this is the place to go.  They hire and stockpile drivers, unlike a lot of companies that run lean, they will over hire then cut driver hours.  Drivers are constantly fighting over available work.  Their customers are in business one day and gone the next.  The pay scale is a constantly moving, different pay rates for different customers,  Your check will usually be wrong, payroll will make a mistake at least every other check.  You will need to keep separate records or you will lose money.  "
bad,"I worked there for 2 years and was there when they took over the contract from Millard. they are the warehousing arm of Nestle and do shipping/receiving, pallet put up of Nestle production, and raw receiving. Ryder management is in a constant state of disarray, and the job culture there is toxic. Ryder Jonesboro has not taken control of this operation since day one, and they have issues every day that  hinder any chance of success. They go through many managers, and the management there now is the worst they have had since inception. I watched many good people come and go in a short period of time, and to suggest that this place breeds instability would be well put. I'm sure as a whole Ryder has a lot of nice places to work at, that have normal operations on a daily basis, but this isn't one of them. My advise: stay away, unless you want to be yelled at, not trained properly, and misled about job advancement/security. If you do give it a try, don't worry if you give up in less than a week, most people do also."
bad,"I worked as a Warranty Service Coordinator with Ryder in the Used Vehicle Warranty Department for exactly 1year and 1day.  From the Day I started the focus was on the color of my skin and not the content of my character.  I witnessed in this environment Caucasians with the same job title that each day were able to work at their own pace and no management interference and also making their customers the last priority.  However, a Coordinator of color only gets on options.  Incoming Calls, Claim Adjudication, and no room for errors because that room has already been assigned to coordinators that aren't of color.  it is 2016 and I never thought the color of my skin would be a deciding factor in my lively hood.  Ryder Used Vehicle Warranty only nurtures the careers of Caucasian Americans the team lead is a self proclaimed redneck as well as the management.  If you care about yourself STAY AWAY!!  You will make Less and the ONLY thing you will be able to provide is Work, Work, Work, while people around you do nothing but walk around aimlessly or watch movies on their phone. The customers also feel the fact that if they are of color they will not even get service in MOST of the Ryder Shops.. I hope they change this it's a large company being ran by the WRONG people."
bad,Scheduling inconsistent with initial interview. No advancement. Low pay. Most days showed up to work and was sent back home because of little or no work. Mandatory to show everyday with no compensation.
bad,"Under new management! Errors by dispatch are often blamed on their drivers resulting in immediate dismissal! If you're looking for professionalism and trust from your superiors, this place is not for you."
bad,This job was not a good fit for me.  Several people difficult to work with.  Never felt like I job stability.  Felt as though I was being micromanaged.  There seemed to be a lot of anger/yelling in this office.  It did not find working at this company a satisfying experience.
bad,Management treats employees poorly. They have a hard time keeping workers there because of that reason. A lot of favoritism.
bad,Mostly every one is a temp and they rarely hire people to the copmany.  Also management only cares about there number and let anybody for no reason. Work hours also change all the time nothing is really stable
bad,"Ryder hires nothing but incompetent managers and the HR group is just as horriable, This company took over the building I was working in. And they made it known they were going to weed out all the other company employees, and low and behold they did just that."
bad,"I really don't have anything good to say, so I would be better off not saying anything about this company. I will say it all depends on who you are as far as getting any where in this company"
bad,A typical day at ryder is highly disorganized and sometimes stressfull The pay is marginal and the management is the worst of any industry. Theres as extremely high employee turnover rate with these guys for a reason. They treat thier employees terrible  You would be wise to shy away from this company and explore other options first Consider this company as a last resort
bad,Worse company to ever work for no raises in 10 years and you have to be friends with manager and dispatcher to get 40 hours. They do nothing fair and HR is only there for management. They only reward clock milkers if you work hard they work you harder with no rewards if I wasn't to old to start a new career I would be gone. Find a company that respects the driver and rewards for doing a good job Ryder does not care about drivers.
bad,"Worst company to work for.nobody  in ryder knows anything about logistics, ask manager that been working for other company how and what to do and say."
bad,"I was dispatched out of the Fontana yard but was in there so called  ""pool"". For the first week I started in Fontana then after that they would send me to Los Angeles, Anaheim and everywhere in between (a couple hours from my house and the yard they said I was going to be out of). No OVERTIME at all and they want you back to work after your 10 hours are up even if you been on the clock for 16 hours.  I've been driving to 15 years and this has to be, hands down the worst job I have ever worked at."
bad,very poor place to work. they will hire anyone regardless of forklift experience or a high school diploma. Most of the workers are lazy and don't to their jobs correct. Worst job I have had.
bad,"All I saw was favoritism, If you weren't with the ""IN"" crowd you were treated like dirt, Some people took really long breaks and left you by yourself to un-load the lines as they started to get backed up, it came to the point where you just didn't care, EVERYONE wanted to be the boss, I'm much happier I don't work for ryder anymore, I'd rather be homeless than work for them again."
bad,Don't pay good work long hours rude supervisors no breaks. Lied about working with you.
bad,"Other Ryder locations should be great but this specific location, employees were overwhelmed and not compensated"
bad,when they needed you it was okay now they are bringing in less experience drivers to do the job and force you out by giving them routes and leaving you hanging with no route. payroll is incompetent they never get the correct pay to you that is coming to you. claim to have incentives but when it comes to pay you all of a sudden they have no idea of what you are talking about. They bring you in for standby and send you home after 4hrs.
bad,They let people go without a just cause or reason.Would lie and tell you how much better everyone else was doing the same run and you would find out that was all a lie. Lot of carrot on a stick type management.Had older trucks and they would not fix the a/c in them when we had one of the hottest summers on record at the time.Said what a great job you were doing and how you came to bat for them when they needed a driver to cover an absent drivers route and never complained. Lots of petty rules that were almost more important than getting the load to the customer on time.The drivers were the fuse in the whole place . If anything went wrong it was the drivers fault reguardless.Slip seating and had co drivers looking for any reason to complain about other drivers to make themselves look good.Things such as got dirt on floor of truck cab or ate something  in cab that left a few crumbs even though you didnt have time to stop and eat on some of the schedules. I learned that no matter how you try in todays and their work enviroment you just a number and easily replaceable . High turnover. People came and went so much I didnt even try to learn their names anymore. They let some great skilled drivers go then wondered why no one wanted to stay or do anything extra.I was one of the few drivers that actually liked the place and now looking back i wouldnt  go back and put up with all i went through just to be cast aside and neither are the other drivers  from what I've seen in their ads for drivers.They had computer systems in the truck that always were acting up and would work for one driver
bad,forklift oprator sitdown or standup ....outbound inbound coordinator ...experience in inventory system database....working on dock...picking to order ....
bad,"What a joke. This company doesn't understand that their employees are the most important asset. As a Fortune 500 company you would think they could afford to pay better. But you get what you pay for, and I can't blame the lower level employees. Management is so concerned with results that they fail to stop and listen to the employees."
bad,"Ryder does not properly train it's employees or provide them with the necessary tools to succeed in their position. Online training is provided for limited positions, but not for all positions.  Unfortunately, this company does not promote a healthy work/life balance, has a poor job culture, compensation is minimal at best, and provides very limited opportunity for advancement.  Management is known to sacrifice subordinates in order to preserve their own employment and Human Resources willfully fabricates information against it's employees and will only retract the incorrect information if the employee stands up for themselves.  The work environment is hostile and employees are subject to abusive customers."
bad,"don't work here ever owner sucks"
bad,everything bad at this company like everyone says. don't complain about anything or you will get fired also don't listen to them about we never fire anyone about anything expect safety that's bs they fired me cause I complain about my paycheck
bad,"Every manager at this company is a power hungry moron. This is mainly at the Novi, MI branch."
bad,stay away from this place..not worth the headache...an they will use you an throw u away.. very high turn over rate.
bad,"Hired on one account ... they knew they would were lossing.  Then transfered me to an account that required a 200.00 a week paycut and increased my hours from 48 a week to well over 65.  Never missed work always dd what I was told and after a year and a half of being dispatched via text they suddenly stopped after I took off 3 days. Didn't know what was going on and after two days finally got ahold of someone and was told that I abandoned my job because I didn't call them after my time off??? Never had to before after any other vac days.  They don't follow there own policies, ask you to do illegal stuff on a weekly basis, and are all around horrible.  I never knew who my boss was, answered to 5 or 6 different people.  The management lies and is generally untrustworth, care little for the drivers.....flat out bad company to work for, beware"
bad,"very libral pro union employees not a lot of work gets done. "
bad,"Management have a tunnel vision when it come to the lower level employees.  Management will not tell the truth about working conditions, Management lie about compensation and benefits, by say the company does not have money, yet they keep creating the upper management positions.  The benefits are about the same as they are in the fast food industry."
bad,felt like that since I WASNT a mexican I got treated differently. I also felt like the bosses were out to get me. I didnt think they cared whether I was there or not. I worked but they didnt show effort in being appreciative of my abilities. I also didnt like the fact that I had no hours
bad,"One of the worst places I ever worked,,, The pay is horrible, management is horrible, dispatchers are horrible.. This place is a total DISASTER"
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work. Management is terrible, dispatchers are clueless & the pay is below average.. They do not support their drivers at all.. Long hours... Do Not Waste Your Time Here!!!"
bad,"Management lies to you constantly and they short your pay consistently. You can complain to Ryder HR and they do nothing.If you like working long hours and make small amounts of money,this is the company for you."
bad,"This is a warning to all the drivers in the Tampa Bay area to not go to work for Ryder ! . The managers are told to lie to the drivers and they do ! I work for them now and it is the biggest mistake I have ever made in my career ! My check changes every week.. they change the way they pay you every week and you cant take vacation when you have earned it ! When you call HR to complain you are told to contact your manager. When you contact your manager they tell you to go back to HR !! You cant access the employee manuel because it is constantly being revised.. so they can change the rules in midstream and not pay the drivers the time that they are owed. They are being sued currently for this very thing and have been sued in the past by drivers and lost in court.. at least the judges in these cases could see how corrupt Ryder is ! They dont care if you have been here 10 years .. 20 years.. no loyalty at all.. they will keep your vacation payr and not feel bad about it. The money that they dont pay you for your vacation goes into the managers pocket as a bonus.. be warned.. check this information out regarding the vacation pay for Ryder,, they also are putting cameras in our trucks in the next couple of weeks so they can watch the drivers constantly.. that way they wont have to pay safety bonuses out either.. more money in the managers pocket. I am writing this in hopes that another driver wont make this same mistake that I did. I have been here to long to get out.. but you can stop yourself from being put in the same position.. run away from this company and spread the word to"
bad,"I have to say that there really is a life ""after"" Ryder ! I worked for this company for almost 12 years. I was a hard worker dedicated , and often picked up the slack of others in my department. Changes in the company came about and I changed right along with them . I never disrespected my boss or senior management and always did what was asked of me and then some . I was very involved with many of the committee's within the company , and got along great with my co-workers. Management sadly does not have a clue as to who is a good worker and is not . I found myself asking why me when I was let go , but today it really doesn't matter , as I feel that they did me the biggest favor. They kept people who were not performing in the team , people that were consistently behind , taking off work , or not pulling their weight. Those people are still there today , and why I ask ... because they either know someone or are willing to be a kiss butt. Sorry I cant do that , went to my boss numerous times with issues , problems with work all to be ignored. I have heard a lot of people who have transferred out of that department and in to others just to preserve their jobs. The only thing that I can say that I miss about this old job is some of the nice and wonderful people I met along the way . Some with whom I still keep in contact with , and sadly I hear them day in and day out complain about how bad things are the hours they are being asked to work , and the time they feel they are missing out with their families. I feel bad for them , but on the same note , they choose to stay and choose"
bad,Don't treat employees with any respect. Your just a number here and thats it!
bad,Management are a bunch of liars. They dont pay you what you are told and they find reasons why you cant use your vacation. Google their name... been sued multiple times by former employees because they refused to give them their vacation time !!!!!!
bad,I worked there about 10 plus yrs.Busted my a$@ for this no good company.I agree totally about a previous post: do ever tell the truth!!!
bad,a day at ryder is a night mare. i wish i never stayed so long. you never know what you are going to get until you walk into the place. you never know if you will be fired or someone is trying to get you fired.
bad,"Avoid this place! There is a reason why they are always advertising for openings in the paper and online, its because employees there are always quitting or getting terminated by low educated management staff. Employee turn over rate is nearly 75percent .Working there is like working for Hitler!! You will see they work you like a dog and show you no respect."
bad,Poorly ran company. never was told or taught what was to be done
bad,this job i wish i had more time to experience permanent employement... i did enjoy wrking here just pay was not so good
bad,A typical day: Try to follow the New Rules of the day (or hour). Blame everyone else for not following the New Rules.
bad,"This was by far the worst job I have ever had. Horrible Management, they will not work with you or train you properly. When you ask for help, they will talk down on you for asking questions...or they will make you read a paper process, and then expect you to know how to do everything by reading a piece of paper. The job description I applied for was completely different than the job they made me do, all they do is lie, lie, lie. Oh yea, and don't call HR for help either, they side with the managers and file a case against YOU for trying to get help. Run far away from this place, it's miserable."
bad,"These people treat you like a slave... Very poor pay scale, have to work 70 hrs a week to make a living...... Management is a joke. Racist, unfriendly, ask you to work illegally... These people wouldn't even give me time off to go to my wife's grandfathers funeral. Work here if you want but you have been warned."
bad,Someone earlier said that they felt this company had a blame culture and that is totally true. There is more empasis on blame than training and supporting.
bad,"Watch your back. The Company DOES NOT believe in work/life balance. Face time is extremely important. No one is accountable for any decision whatsoever and seeks to place blame and find scapegoats. The Executive Team is especially prone to doing this. There are NO female Senior Executives -- what does this tell you? One day you are on a pedestal, the next you are on the ""downsizing"" list."
bad,"Not good for your mental health. didn't learn much, Management is not your friend,coworkers are only out for themselves,"
bad,Worked in riverside ca. In my 24 yrs of being a truck driver I have never hated a job more. No flexibility.. Slip seating but no natter how much a truck problem was written up it was never addressed.. One supervisor even tried to pick a fight with a driver and when he realized he picked the wrong fight he called security and hid in the office. Dispatchers picked on drivers and had their favorite suck ups who pretty much got to do whatever they wanted. The suck ups(not harder workers) would sit in the office and pick and choose the routes that paid the most and this went on for my 2 years that sufdered there.. I busted my tail for the same amount of money that I get from unemployment while looking for another job.. Bottom line... worst working ezperience ever and I could obviously wright a book about it.
bad,"good and productive, how to drive a truck and learn, how to do repairs, and got my CDL,"
bad,"Decent for Hourly associates, bad for salaried associates."
bad,Awful company to work for. They will run you into the ground working 7 days a week for a month at a time with no compinsation.
bad,I spent 10 years there management made promises but never keep them the pay sucked they put new guy's ahead of the people who put time in the people running the show don't know when they are doing
bad,This Business unit is the worst to work for!! They make promises to you to get you to work and dont follow through! There Facilities are falling apart
bad,"worked for RMMS. "
bad,"Won't waste any more time on this company. One of the worst trucking jobs out there. Ryder cares about Ryder and their insurance rating. The pay is third world and definitely not Commercial Driver pay. 600 miles a night for less than 1,000.00 a week. Late dispatch, and an elaborate training pay that locks you into their degrading pay scale."
bad,"Kinda like highschool. Snitches and **tches. Worst management system ever. Communication is horrible. Constant revolving door, and manager thinks he's a god."
bad,management very bad/they have bad attitudes in office/no team work/favortism rules/they lie about everything/equipment dirty/benefits not the greatest/pay too low
bad,"Every man for himself. Senior employees cheat the system making the production numbers nearly unattainable. Management doesn't thoroughly investigate issues,  accidents happen all the time without being reported. General manager has a God complex."
bad,"To work in the service department is to fight cancer - you know it's going to kill you, it's simply a matter of when, and how long you are willing to fight it. Prepare for managers that know nothing about the work you do, some whom you've never met, who will berate you for not meeting a deadline or bending over backward for them. Make no mistake, they are here to step on you. You will mean nothing to them. Your fight will include lacking proper tools and scrounging for hardware. You will have to keep your mouth shut as well. The squeaky wheel gets greased or lobbed off here. So if you want a job where you can choose not to show up or call out and know your job is protected, this is for you. If it takes you five months to do a clutch job, and the engine's seized when your done, this is for you. If you want to work somewhere where no one cares about the quality of your work, or the effort you put into it, this is for you. If your name is your bond, and the measure by which you judge character, and you take pride in your work and want to take pride in the place you do it, seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"The worst finance collections Dept. Management team and human resources I experience. HR doesn't look out for the employees. Managers takes things personal, and will fine ways to make your work life hard."
bad,"Easy work, easiest job I’ve ever encountered. But management is very poor. Fire rate is high, management will write associates up and complain about something one day then the next day say it’s okay to do. A few supervisors are cool and they acknowledge hard workers but most supervisors don’t there. Management is so bad in Tracy I’ve seen the GM quit."
bad,Not much tenure within management. No one knows what theyre doing. Poor communication and very childish and immature behavior within management. Inventory in particular is a mess
bad,Never work here. Management does whatever they want. They treat employees horrible. AROs and LT think they are managment. They wont cross train you...
bad,Productive to work it was a challenge to work at ryder everyday was different day it was a very stressful place  to work the management was disrespectful to everyone. new people come and they handle the leads disrespect with new employees
bad,"Thankless place to work. Mostly unskilled leadership above the drivers. Well below standard pay for work performed. Must finish your run at all costs. I would not recommend this company for anyone who wants to be respected or for long term employment. You are considered ""just a butt in a seat"". Management preaches about safety, but that is where it ends."
bad,"If you're looking for a long term job, PLEASE look somewhere else.  You are better off working at a fast food joint. There's a reason 95% of the warehouse hasn't been there for over 8 months. VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE. Management don't know how to do their job and I know a few 5yr olds with more basic knowledge than HR. This lady will mess up your pay, mess up your W2, mess up your points then fire you. If you end up working there, make sure you keep all paperwork because you will need them to prove her wrong. They say they dont favor people but there's a very high level of favoritism and unfairness. I dont think it's fair to have someone in HR who's having all these issues with people pay and job security to hold her position just because she's family with the boss or whatever that my be. It's a problem because this is how people take care of their families. I wish I did my research before working here. For example,  there are far more negative reviews than positive."
bad,"Overnight shift in all weather types including some considered dangerous."
bad,"Don't work here unless you like bein stressed out over a rate system that doesnt work right and that isn't fair or made unless you cheat there faulty system, new managment and hr are complete GARBAGE look elsewhere for similar pay. Treats employees like robots with no lives unless you have FMLA than your more than golden to show up to work once a month and have nothing done to you this place doesnt know how to keep good employees either they all leave."
bad,Management is terrible.  Very negative vibe throughout the company.  We were bad mouthed for things that were out of our control.  I hated working there.
bad,"When I arrived the person that had worked there the longest was 1 year. Everyone else was new within the last 3 months. HIGH turn over rate. Uptight personnel. I’m not the type to be on my cell phone but you’ll get fired if you even glance at it to check the time, even when you’re off the clock and just walking out the building. No warning. They see your phone, terminated on the spot. Young inexperienced HR manager screwed up hiring process from day one. Was told I would get personal time. Nope lied about that. No personal time allowed. No vacation days. They lied about that too. Low wage. Go anywhere else to run a lift and you’ll get paid more. Target starts at $18/hr. XPO starts at $20/hr. Old dominion starts at $18/hr. Which will all hire without experience. Operations manager is a joke and is a complete snake. HR manager doesn’t know the policies and can’t be relied on at all. They will mandate you to work overtime with no notice. Told us we would have to come in tomorrow(which was a Sunday) for mandatory OT and would be fired if we didn’t. Even if you volunteer to work OT on previous days. Place is a complete joke. Only upside is that after working 7 days straight they will buy a bucket of KFC. Wow"
bad,"Working for Ryder at the Southwest Ranches location was a really bad experience. Working in the warehouse lifting big heavy boxes that weight like 80 lbs, being treated like animals, safety hazards everywhere, bad warehouse system, and the management does not even care, most of the time they just walk around and yell...don't get me started with the second shift supervisor who does nothing all day and just stare at his phone until he sees something and screams to his team leads, or kick you out for the dumbest reasons. Everyone at this location are just working there to look for a new better job to then quit. The pay and hours are not good considering there are no fans, no bathrooms, no cafeteria, 8 to 12 hour shifts each day, and the high levels of stress. The management team does not care for the employees as it seems from the conditions mentioned above, but also that fact that whe are supposed to get two 15 minutes breaks but can only take one; getting our lunch break cut short also because the supervisor wants to overwork us!."
bad,"No training is offered, even after requesting this repeatedly. "
bad,Hr sucked they do not care when the workers have to say or what we do and then the management sucked because they look at people who they know and not how hard you work it the people you know and thats how they move up
bad,The absolute worst place I have ever worked in my 20 year career in logistics. Management awful. I was a front-line supervisor. The worst job I have ever had.
bad,Horrible. Employer cares nothing about employees health and well being. They don't listen to employees. They don't value their employees. Worstbplace ever.
bad,You plan on wanting to move up unless you work here 6-7 years.  The bosses are on pure favoritism and only focus on the people that suck up the most and do the least amount of work.  People that do the least get by with doing less than production and bosses still give them 100% and the people that are trying no help at all.  Good luck if you go.  You wont last long.
bad,Do not listen to employees Management tell you one thing and then do another very stressful company to work for I worked for this company for many many years and I really hate that I spent so many years with a company that don't value they employees
bad,"ryder operated verizons warehouse in Alburtis,pa.. management has little or no idea what they are doing. Verizon is the same way. they want to run it with mostly with temps. they get rid of fulltime ryder employies.  you do not want to work there. run from this place. they had some good people there but left."
bad,"I was a temp and was thrown on the floor to ""shadow"" someone for a week and put in a ""class"" where you were told to forget everything you learned on the floor. The class was a week and if you didn't learn the codes required you were just out of luck!!! The following week you're on your own!!! And management was too busy to help you with any questions. Never worked in a place where they tell you if you have a questions ask, but when you do no one can answer them!!"
bad,No work life balance. No training or instruction on what is needed to be successful in your role. Management does not care what you need to do to get what they want and nothing else matters. Not good at communicating anything that is needed but will punish if it is not done.
bad,If you need a job this is a job to get you by until you can find something this is nothing you need to think long term or you end up miserable wondering why did you waste your time.
bad,If you dont like playing politics and schmoozing up to people then this is not the place for you. Incompetent managers who have computer experience but nothing else. No leadership or personality. Constant turnover.
bad,"No such thing here as job security,  lots of promises from management with no results. Racial discrimination all time high and management did nothing to diffuse swept it under the rug."
bad,"I was this close to raising the other stars just to ensure that management will be the lowest, but I feel that I can cover that issue well enough to leave the stars as they are. If you want decide whether or not to work for this company without reading the in depth rant then just scroll down to the final sentence."
bad,"It started out great. But then the company fell behind on its orders, 64 days behind to be exact. Then my supervisor started to feel the heat from his superiors. He started to being difficult to talk to and work with. Not to mention he had his favorites. I just think he has a tough time relating to most of his workers since they where numerous ex-employees who had quit. Really I just had a bad experience with one supervisor. There where others who seemed to better relate to the people working under them. Overall this place had potential to be a great work environment, they just need to polish some things out."
bad,ryder has a lot of different department mines was document control I gathered all the info to get the crews started I entered data entry for the entire shift and also recaps and backflush
bad,"They direct hire all the people who dont have a clue about the job. They claim money tight but continue giving overtime to people that come in just to milk the clock and sleep on the job!! The temp service claim after 90 days you expected to get hired in. That still havent happened for some. They have these stupid point and incentives, that have the workers acting like savages. I bust my butt out there in the cold and still aint hired.. I gotta say this by far the worst job I have had in my life."
bad,"Management was verbally abusive, pay was well below industry average for my skill set, there seemed to be an culture of pettiness. I absolutely would not recommend working here."
bad,"start at 7 pm I'm a drop and hook driver with no extra work available even when asking (begging)poor management , the best thing about Ryder is my co workers  they are great bunch of people,"
bad,"A typical day at Ryder at this organization initially was fine because of the person who prepared me to take over her positions. However, once I was asked to take on more roles, the transition left a lot to be desired. They shoudl apdot a policy of doing an ecit interview  on the person's first day to ensure they have all the necessary tools and information to be successful. Do not use the excuse that this person is challenging to deal with after the fact! What I learned is to speak up early in the process and not sit by idle and wait for someone (in a leader role) to give me the tools and information I need to do my job. The enjoyabel part of my job is I love what I do, in spite of the very poor leadership!"
bad,I feel that my potential can grow somewhere else who will appreciate me
bad,Easy Work
bad,"Middle management will throw you under the bus every chance they get. They are self-serving glory hounds who care not for the company or their customer, they only want personal accolades. It's a ""boys club"" at Ryder, and if you're NOT in the club, you're screwed, because nobody will have your back. AND, they will make you work unpaid weekend overtime, with little to no notice, they expect you to deal with it. Lastly, God forbid that you get caught helping an employee, especially a union employee. I just saw an excellent Supervisor get fired for trying to help a Union employee who had a personal issue. Ryder Lansing is only for those who are either really desperate for a paycheck or are committing career suicide. Do yourself a favor. Stay away!!"
bad,"My time with Ryder, I trained myself. Lack of any sort of proper training process. Focused so much on financials, not on the people...that are human, have families, things happen! It's called life! I worked for a hot head who had been there and done everything. No raises! No advancement opportunities!"
bad,Terrible place to work. Do not apply here unless you do not want to have a life outside of work. Upper management is a joke. Absolutely worst place ever worked for.
bad,The worst company I have ever worked for. Benefits are ok at best. Hardly no training and a lot of lies. Management is horriable and always looking for reasons to make work life harder and how they can bully you around. The employee has to be a puppet or they will be cut. The corporate management is the same. They say they will stand up and have the employee's best interest first LOL. Do your self a favor find work else where.
bad,"Nothing good about ryder especially in Chicago area poor management rude HR staff. They toss people away like trash when they loose accounts, without warning."
bad,"I would ""Never"" advise anyone to ""Work"" for this company !.... To many Rules & Regulations , Broken Promises , Ect. They will promise you everything, Give you nothing, & take half of that away !....."
bad,"Made us come too work during a blizzard where no travel advised. Did not make it, was fired. HR is also terrible. She acts like she wants to see you get fired."
bad,They are not organized any they cheated me out of a week vacation and I was talk bad to the computer was always freezing up and they didn't have enough computer to go around and the parts room is not organized
bad,"Worked at a branch in the Pacific northwest for 2yrs until, a racist manager was transferred to take the vacant position of sr manager. He has ego beyond his brain."
bad,"Average day - come in, pre-trip, inspect load, have it reloaded 3 out of 5 days,strap & tarp unorgainzed loads when rain,snow, wet roads (NO TARP PAY) average 15/20 stops a day, typical 10/12 hours a day, $22.00 an hour. Lowest paid in steel industry average 23.00 a hour plus conestoga trailers. Unload customer location forklift/crane in buildings, streets, alley, etc. pick up returns, C.O.D. checks, and return to shop. On board log (People Net) camera's in/out, on board lane system w/ automatic braking when ghost image appears (that nice when truck is heavy everything slides) Freightliner Equipment, automatic's. Ryder repair second to none in service take two hours to change a mud flap and a light bulb at the shop, I wonder what a road repair would take (you might want to get a hotel room)"
bad,"Overall Ryder as a company good most people are great. However certain people spoil it though and there is poor managers pouring out a dreadful work environment. Seen so many people breaking rules and no discipline. In fact most of those progress. No recognition for hard working, dedicated, honest people. "
bad,Ryder protects and promotes useless managers.  The good thing is all of us with talent and a spine are now Ryder competitors.  And business is booming.
bad,"Talk to the teck they didn't like the way the company going ."
bad,Ryder cistem very very poor place to work it mos unconfortable place to work to extresfull its very night mare work at Rider corp the managmmet its very poor people to work inconclution its pease shet work at Rider
bad,This place is horrible. They set you up for failure. I wouldn't come back if they offered me to. I wouldn't be surprised if they lost their contract because of the low down stuff they do to ppl
bad,"The first few years were ok but in the past 6 years working there has gone from I'll deal with it to I'm looking for a job. In there eyes you are a number,  Denying bereavement leave on multiple occasions, and telling you that the Dr. Appointment you made 3 weeks ago on a day that you didn't have to work, will cost you a day off, when they let you know you have to work the 2-3 day weekend, less than an hour before you leave for the weekend you are not going to get. (Unless you find another job,  I'm looking!"
bad,Treated workers as if they were not smart at all. Very bias in handing out the work. Work in a system by time and production and its not accurate. Management not aware of workload. Culture is not good. Workers who have been a long time are very disgruntled.
bad,They don't let you advance in the company not unles you are a favorite they over work you and don't appreciate anything you do as far as hard work and long hours up to 12hrs with only one 30 min lunch break.
bad,"Ryder can be a good company if you don’t want to move up and stay in the same position for over a year.  There is no training.  Your expected to figure out everything and then get reviews on your progress, which is unfair based on the fact that you weren’t given any proper training and guidance.  I went through 2 managers with false promises. I am very disappointed with this company and it’s sad that such a large company does not look out for its employees that are lower on the totem poll.  I miss it because of the people but I don’t miss it because of the politics.  Apply at your own risk."
bad,They have hired a bunch of 20 year old driver managers  with no driving experience to run the trucks. They will try to force you to run loads illegally by threatening to write you up for LOAD ABANDONMENT if you can't run the load. When the driver managers go home your driver support goes with them which means you can be broke down for hours and if there is a problem with your load you have to wait until 0800 before it can be fixed. You will work long hours during the week because you have to cover for drivers quitting all week and you will bring home after taxes around $700. They have two way cameras installed in the trucks which they use to write you up for any reason so you will have someone watching you your entire trip.   Protect YOUR DRIVING RECORD !!     STAY FAR AWAY !!    IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE .
bad,"Everything that can go wrong will go wrong. I was at Ryder long enough to realize that it was a job and not a career.  Career's take the opportunity to train you professionally do to your job.  Job's give you just enough to throw you to the wolves and fight for yourselves.  When I arrived management and other employees constantly reminded me how they were having a hard time filling my role and that people didn't stick around and I soon realize why.  The position of Service Employee I-Regulated state repetitive fueling, working with customers and meeting a demanding need including, but not limited to cleaning and fueling vehicles, but every day I calculated that beyond the standing for 8 hours I walked back and forth from the fuel aisle to wash bay about 7,000 miles.  "
bad,"Management picks favorites and ignores everybody else. They would rather do nothing and have no problems than do their work to ensure quality and comfort. Work here if you are lazy and manipulative, they will reward you for it"
bad,"I worked there 5 years between 2 locations. transferring from Neville to shippensburg, when the newville location closed. I didnt get the first years raise, their explanation. I hadn't worked for ship plant a year?! ok nice little loop hole. Things digressed as the years continued. I did my job, numbers above average. They informed us they were starting a new program to give us bonuses. the more we did the higher the bonus. not a SINGLE member of management could explain how it worked and no surprise to me. we never received a single bonus. I was promised an extra dollar an hour to train new employees. when I received my check I was informed this was not true an what I received added up to 16cents an hour far less that I was promised. I then refused to train new staff. over the years I witnessed countless amounts of tattle tailing and gossip have even found myself being the subject of whispers. I can handle that. we had safety meeting after safety.in these meetings our managers came up with the idea of captain of the ship. if you think something is unsafe you can call said "" captian of the ship"", your manager then has to review the situation and and"
bad,"Stay away from Ryder Novi. They don't enforce their own critical safety rules. Management who tried to enforce these rules is thrown under the bus by corporate. They're more concerned with possible litigation or unionization from drivers than with safety and professional behavior. They pretend to back site managers until someone threatens a lawsuit. The do a complete 180 and terminate managers who actually try to do their job and promote safety and accountability. If you're a driver, it's the Wild West. Do what you want. If you're a manager, you aren't allowed to manage and have zero support from corporate. No principles, no spine, and outright dishonest. Run!!!"
bad,Ryder itself isnt a bad company to work for but the Columbia shop and its management is the worst that I have EVER worked for. The manager dont care about their employees and only look and care about their numbers. They play favorites and if you arent one of them then they hang you out to dry. They have you do work that they havent trained you on and getting trained on anything takes forever. I would NOT recommend the Columbia shop to ANYONE!!
bad,"I would never take the opportunity to work there ever again, they talk to you like a child and blame any problems on the employees. The management team is a joke."
bad,"Very stressful "
bad,If i knew how badly managed this place was i would not have started work. Upper management at this location are very racist. they also work on a by me coffee and i will let you relax ( do no work). they have no regard for honest and any sense of personal responsibility. they have mastered the art of fall out and drop the the blame on colored employees.
bad,If you like working long hours for little pay this is a great place. They have a 1000 dollar a week guarantee. Which is great until you realize how many hours you work an it averages 11 dollars an hour.
bad,"Typical day usually very busy."
bad,"Pick, inspect, pack, and ship outgoing parts to client."
bad,The management was horrible! The HR was only there to help management! Did not care about the employees! I am surprised nobody has sued this company at this location.
bad,"Do NOT work here. This place will set you up to fail, they do not care about you as a person. You can NOT move up at this company either. Pay is okay if you're young."
bad,the management didnt follow up on anything.Half the time they didnt know who was absent and /or who was actually at work . They never knew at the start of shift exactly how many hours we were going to work .you would work 16 hours one day and the very next day they would send you home due to lack of work.
bad,"Every mechanic has to clock flag hours, If you didnt make anything up to cover your hours then management would get chewed out and lose their budget, so mechanics have to  make up issues to customer vehicles in order to cover their hours, which means overcharging customers for work that never got performed,"
bad,If you want a job to have a quick nasty ending just come to work for Ryder.  The Edmonton office is rife with corruption and my way or the highway mentality.gets old real fast..  The most inept upper management I have seen in 20 years of working in this industry.  Office romances abound.
bad,There was a lack of support from management while working on an onsite management position.  There was no support with operational or staffing issues.
bad,"Was offered the position after 1 30 minute interview, so I expected it was a position they had trouble keeping filled. The job duties include a lot of responsibility without any real power to influence positive change. If GM is shut down you are forced to use your vacations, travel to another GM location, or go unpaid. GM people are not very kind to any of the 3rd party providers and make it known we are not part of the GM Team.  In 1.5 yrs I applied for several internal positions with Ryder; I would receive a call about scheduling an interview, give them my available times, only to never hear back.  This occurred 4 times."
bad,this company does give technical documentation for support. I give management a bad review. Things are promised but never done. rules are up to the whims of the manager in charge.  Its the biggest joke of a company  I've  ever worked for.  I do not recommend any one trying to seriously looking in to a career with ryder.  every second of you day is micro managed. no respect is given for hard work. your reward for working hard is being expected to work even harder the next day.
bad,"I  got approved for the assignment. Showed up to job location and Manager at duty stopped me at the door saying, ""This is for entry work, you wouldn't fit in here."" Then the temp agency counted it against me. What a joke."
bad,You get let go for following your supervisors example and very poor communication regarding safety. Too much mandated OT. Very poor upper management  only looking out for themselves. The job function wasn't bad.
bad,"Morale is super low. The dispatch office has 2 competent, knowledgeable people with many years dispatching experience, but due to personal relationships and personal agendas, someone who has 5 months dispatching experience has been given a position she doesn't deserve, nor knows what to do with."
bad,This company was horrible from the start. Very poor management. Told one thing and then it's another.This by far has been the worst place I've ever worked for.
bad,"Although at first glance this seemed to be a great opportunity, this company is know for its RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. Among many other encounters; I asked repeatedly for additional training and support throughout my time at the company and was denied by management, while they continued to site me for shortcomings.  Other employees of other nationalities requested the same support and received it without hesitation. Then, while on medical leave after passing out at work, they intentionally ignored my calls to enroll in FMLA for 3 consecutive days and deemed me a ""no call no show' and I was terminated."
bad,"Poor managing. Extremely unprofessional from management, human Resources, supervisors to half of the workforce. Unfair  seniority practices and favoritism run rampant without any union backing!"
bad,"I feel there is no room for advancement, ask for it and work your butt off and still nothing.  They don't trust the judgement of techs to properly complete a job. They sweep a lot of problems under the rug, hoping they go away only to find out some other shop has to fix them. I feel like I work at a band aid shop more than an actual truck shop. drivers are always complaining about how the shop is ran and the quality of certain shifts work."
bad,"What a joke. This company doesn't understand that their employees are the most important asset.The company doesn't care at all for the drivers and in Cali is not  way  you can get any help,But you get what you pay for, and I can't blame the lower level employees. Management is so bad here and the dispatchers are really bad because they have their special drivers and those are the ones who get the good routes the others are screw and the general manager doesn't listen to the employees."
bad,"I worked for Ryder for almost 3 years and throughout my three years I learned how to do almost every job in the building... There was a bare minimum of good training done. So I took matters into my own hands and asked questions, learned things here and there, then eventually became a well rounded employee. I was promoted then demoted. Why? The company is dirty. They will do whatever they have to do to save money. Also there is a fair deal of drama that persists in the warehouse that they do nothing about. The workers that do their job and do it well are cursed for being a good worker yet they keep the ones who take advantage of the naive supervisors and petty surveillance. It goes to show they do not know their workers as well as they should, or should care to. In the beginning of my job things were going somewhat smooth, then they started to get cheaper and more strict. You should be able to enjoy your job and get rewarded for the admirable things your have done and keep doing. The benefits suck, they do nothing for good production or good attendance, they give no bonuses or special meals or anything special for holidays. I saw a review on here that said they get paid for lunches? NO, you don't. The supervisors will turn your back on you as well. I can only think of two people I liked in upper management. One is a supervisor and the other is a newly promoted area manager. They do their job well and they look out for the employees who do their job well. The absolute hardest part of my job was dealing with a few people because the supervisors wouldn't. My job and every job in"
bad,"They had a poor training program. If you know logistics then this is the perfect job for you. If not, get out while you can."
bad,Bad Management. No room for growth. Huge turnover rate with employees.
bad,"Hours suck, leadership is a joke, no help at all but they are right there to find a way to write you up. Ive never been written up but very high turnover for both management & truck drivers. Pay is good but job absolutely sucks and you don't get any quality of life. Very high turnover!"
bad,From the very beginning this company start lying....Nothing they have promisd has been true .... They keep you going from account to account... With an all over the place schedule.... when I got on an account with a stable schedule I was asked to take a pay cut which I did not want to do so they gave my job away to another driver for less money. Things like this that goes to show that they do not value a drivers that works hard everyday and gets the job done the management sucks they are truly a professional. Also because of the craziness and the payment because of the craziness and the schedule... You do not get a full paycheck and they refuse to pay going rate or overtime
bad,"There is a reason there is constant turn over(130 drivers in 4 months). We have single guys like myself who need 40-50 hours a week and are forced to work 66+. Then there are people like my friend who need those hours and get 40-45. Essentially they give you what you don't need or want. You are talked to in an unprofessional manner up to and including profanity. You need a day off for court or personal issues forget it. Want your job, better come to work. If you are absolutely desperate and being homeless isn't an option then endure it until you find better. The pimp agency that does the initial hiring has become so desperate that they are now offering full benefits day one."
bad,Got hired and was never told that I would have
bad,Started out a great place to work. Don't make any suggestions and if the manager doesn't like you personally your done. got another position and was in it nearly years. That was my mistake. Was shockingly laid off 6 months ago instead of people who did not follow policy.
bad,"As supervisors we were asked to keep morale up while upper management had use cut hours one week, and mandate them the next. We were asked to baby sit all of the hourly employees by actually watching them on there breaks 3 times a night and giving reason why a person was ""not working"" for 16 minutes rather than 15."
bad,Upper management definitely has favoritism.  They will advance some people and others they will hold back even if you are more than qualified and capable of doing the job.
bad,No path for career advancement and the mgmt did not have any meaningful connection to their staff. Mgmt were generally unwilling to receive employee input for projects and company growth.
bad,"Mangers play favoritism, try to set you up to fail, with drive cams, not really for insurance purposes.  They put them in the truck to see what your doing at all times"
bad,"very sad location not even kn the map to find it. Have to call for directions to het there. "
bad,They have a camera located on the inside of the truck that watches everything you do even when you don’t make the camera go off by turning to hard or putting on brakes to fast it’s a invasion of your privacy they are looking at you when you on your lunch and that’s your time they say there for drivers safety NO they are for Ryder if you work for them quite
bad,Extremely poor management and not concentrating on well being of employees . Did not take time to keep in contact with Spectrum other the email. Totally sad that after a year it was a blind eye.
bad,"Nothing permanent available on day shift.  Just only long term temporary position only, with no available permanent position. The lead treats any new people like they are stupid & doesn't care if you've done warehousing before. I definitely would not recommend this company to even my worst enemy."
bad,"No respect "
bad,They will entice you with a great guarantee and then give you stipulations when you start driving with them. The management running the shelbyville KY account so not have a clue on trucking. They were never available for help or questions. Nothing promised was ever given.
bad,"Been working for ryder 17 mo. No raise,no vacation, bunch of promises ,no incentives , nothing it so sad a company would treat there employees like that who been committed to them from day one and always at work everyday  !!!!!!!! So Sad !!!!!!!"
bad,No training program. Bad upper management who have lost all knowledge of how the front lines work.  Only concerned about shareholder and don’t care how they get the returns.
bad,"very hostile work place extremely poor management lift truck operator,load and unload product from trailer"
bad,I worked for Ryder for 2 years. Sometimes 100 hours a week. Did anything I was asked at anytime.Sometimes didnt get a day off for months.It meant nothing to them. I was told daily I wasnt valuable and eventually they made up some things and got rid of me. Then they fought my unemployment and would not verify  my driving experience.
bad,first of all  you will  not be paid your  Weekly Guarantee if a holiday  falls on one of your working  days  or  if a load cancel's. you will be  expected  to spend many  hours off the clock waiting on your truck to show up before you start your shift.
bad,Managment in the Laredo Tx is one of the  worst places to work they start they give you training of every thing and they in the Laredo area they say don't worry do it they turn around we didn't said that.
bad,I would not recommend that anyone I knew worked there and without getting into any reasons I would like to leave it at that. If you want my real opinion then you can ask me directly.
bad,"management allowed politics and race to become a part of the day and it was all down hill from that  point.  So be prepared this company will sacrifice you and your "
bad,"Ryder is at their 2nd General manager in within year, the management team are very unprofessional from appearance to knowledge to how to treat people a very out to get you vibe.  The lack of management experience shows vividly in all aspects of running a 3PL. This facility has to much drama for as little as it.  FAVORTISM"
bad,"Really bad place to work. You are put on a order with others and trying to make rate. You are put against your co workers. A few favorites by upper management get handed orders early to make max incentive (They hand you off the top, the favorites get handed from the middle of the pile, a fresh order to cherry pick) then drop off the order when everything easy is picked off it, so you are left with leftovers. "
bad,"Horribly ran company. Management is only interested in metrics, not real world scenarios. All departments are adversarial. Sales team makes remarkably unfulfillable promises. Rental is off in space, and the shop is outrageously overworked."
bad,They say they care but it really doesn’t show.  Poor management on the account.  Completely awful relationship with contract.  It’s real hard to keep a good attitude in this working environment.  Communication does not exist.
bad,Always looking to improve and stay at the forefront of service and customer needs. You must be willing to adapt and change to be successful but it makes it a good place to work
bad,Mattel is no longer in business with Ryder. Somewhere along the line the business partnership went wrong. Management was totally ineffective with the mission and completely unprofessional with employees. I don't know how so many experienced professionals let a warehouse go completely off the rails.
bad,"Was a driver delivering Toyota auto parts.. You get a different bid every month, and if you are extra board..you do anything they tell you... All trucks are slip seat and load/bid specific..meaning, you are in all sorts of different trucks...nothing to call your own... Very strict on any attendance issues no matter what..5 points and you're done... Trucks are in a big gravel lot thats really a mudhole and thats where you park your 4-wheeler as well...the office is a clunky jobsite trailer with no running water...go figure. The trucks are not maintained..my road test truck had such bad brakes I almolst refused to drive it...the tester said..."" Its a Ryder truck!..HaHa""... Ive neen driving 26 years and they insisted that O needed to ""ride along"" with a 5 year driver (Ryder driver) in order to get ""trained"".... What a joke this place is....STAY AWAY!!!!."
bad,Since ive been here never missed one day on time worked good but then yet the way ryder is  managed been discriminating and lack of. respact. Never been in a work place that has no professional in service
bad,Ryder has a lot of work to do on its system and its chain of command. A typical day is okay if you make it that long with the company. The pay is less than fair.
bad,"I liked the actual job I performed, and the hours were good.  OT happened now and again depending on the needs of the customer.  The company is however top-heavy when it comes to management.  I had three bosses and five other associates that I worked with in the storehouse with.  At times it was confusing as you didn't know who was actually running the show.  Communication from top down was horrible.  I always felt like I was being kept in the dark and felt as if the company didn't want to share anything with me.  Also, the rate of pay for this particular place I worked at were far, far below the industry average for this type of job.  I also felt that the benefit package was a little 'cheap' as if Ryder found the cheapest benefit plan that they could for their employees.  I actually had better coverage when I worked a full-time retail job!!"
bad,"Ryder was a nice company to work for in the warehouse operation in support a GM factory. Within the warehouse we handle all shipping, receiving, cross-docking, sequence, and fulfillment operations"
bad,"Management had to constantly answer to corporate, passing their stress on to employees. More emphasis was spent on speed instead of safety and quality, the word safety was used a lot but rarely done. This location has a high turnaround of employees because of unrealistic work expectancy and low pay for what is expected. For fortune 500 company very little is spent on the latest equipment, very surprising,"
bad,"Poor management, disorganized, hired for a particular position but never physically did the work.  No computers for employees,  Unsafe conditions with the forklift drivers."
bad,"Ryder claims to be best in class but there is nothing further from reality. Managers have little training and learn by on the job experiences. The company is a men's club and advancement is based upon who you know, not what you know. They claim to be fair and consistent, abiding by company standards and ethics. There's more damage control than improvement. Ryder gains revenue by low-balling opportunities then figuring it out after the fact. Benefits are average. Many employees feel taken advantage of."
bad,"Management very unorganized, last minute decision makers , work their people 14 days straight, demotivating as the director barks orders on bull horn."
bad,"They preach safety safety safety.. But give you unsafe routes and delivery schedules that can not be met performing your duties in a safe manor. Rules do not apply to every driver in the same manor. If you sit around and chit chat with the manager you can have an multiple accidents and he will sweep them under the rug. But even if your a GREAT employee with a squeaky clean record. And not a in-house social butterfly. You will be threatened and labeled as an outcast. And they will find a way to get you out the door. Raises do not exist, for ANYONE PERIOD!!!! All bonuses and profits are shared among management only."
bad,"I was with this company 9 months. At the end of that time I was fast tracked out due to my concerns with safety. Rather then deal with the issues, it was decided it was easier to get rid of me, thus silencing the voice."
bad,mi dia comenzaba a las 5:45 a.m tomaba el trasporte al llegar a la empresa me cambiaba ingresaba al almacen luego comenzaba la junta de 15 minutos despues traspaleaba material todo el dia hasta las 6 de la tarde ya que mi turno era de 12 hrs. aprendi a traspalear material
bad,No proper training at all of company until when something happens.  High turn-overs.  Lots of temp drivers. You have to bid on routes every month.  Only top drivers that been working longer has first pick of routes and last hired gets the routes nobody wants and horrible start times.  Temp drivers don't even stay here long.
bad,"Working at Ryder Whirlpool has been a very nice privilege, and I appreciate the people who work with me feel at ease when I have a rough day. It's either a really laid back day with barely anything to do or it's a really hectic day and I have so much time to do 20 things at once!"
bad,"Management is pitiful.they work you like a dog. They don't care if you get a break or a lunch. They leave you hanging. They talk about team work. There is none. It's everyone for themselves."
bad,"Extremely high turn over rate at the time of writing this review. On second shift only a handful of people have been here longer then a year myself included. Currently the warehouse is mandated OT five days a week (suppose to be four 10 hr. shifts).  Lately they have started letting the new guys who aren't making rate stay home as a form of ""punishment"" but all it is doing is aggravating the experienced operators. They'll tell you they work with you so you achieve rate but all they do is follow you around an hour out of your day and then ""coach"" you if you don't make rate. Second shift supervisors have absolutely no back bone and instead of voicing our concerns to management they just tell us its above their pay grade. If you do manage to get a hold of management they just dance around your questions. All in all they only reason I would suggest taking this job is if you needed something until you found a job more long term."
bad,"My job is to primarily sale the benefits and services Ryder Transportation has to offer large and small businesses.  I have a faily large territory that requires me to drive alot.  I love selling as well as training potential managers/sales people new in the position.  Since the compensation package has changed drastically since the beginning of my career at Ryder, the position has become less desireable."
bad,I worked for Ryder for 4 years and I have seen at least 50 different people lose there jobs due to a corrupt system. Supervisors included.This position that is being offered right now is available due to this.I look at all the other reviews across the U.S. and they all look the same. Ryder is a terrible company to work for. The money looks good due to the economic state of America but the stress and mistreatment that you will see and possible experience is not worth it.  
bad,"Worthless company, management is below all standards, and no family time, join at your own risk!"
bad,Work anywhere from 12 to 13 hour days six and sometimes seven days a week with no extra compensation or comp days. No time for family or any other activities. Ryder expects supervisors and managers to be at work anytime the doors are open. Would not recommend to anyone!
bad,"Pay is well below market. Systems are 25 years old - general ledger is kept in a software system that does not have a graphical user interface. Overall, most employees seem very unhappy with the company."
bad,"completely un-organized too many bosses and not enough space/work area money is good but you will pay for it working outside in minus tempuratures for a dollar more an hour,ran from the eastern time zone with little or not awareness of the Edmonton economy good people in a bad situation, lots of up to date training is avaiable"
bad,"overall work was crazy you never new what u were doing. but the money was excellent, management makes and changes the rules on a whim"
bad,"Three hourly employees taught me three different ways to do the same job. One hourly trainer was another part time employee who did not want me cutting into his hours. He intentionally gave me improper instructions to make me look bad, abused his authority no by, yelled at me while I was in the driver seat then claimed I was being agumentative. Thesuperiordoes a it have a permanent office and only responds to phone calls if she so desires. atrargume"
bad,"The mgt protects each other and don't care if they place their employees in a safety risk situation or not.When you tell them a situation like s going on, unless it directly and nvolves them, they don't care."
bad,"The manager expected us to deliver products more than a block away from customer, to much hand balming for driver. Trucks were loaded to the back door so we couldn't turn skids around when we had to. Customers complaints were handled badly by not supporting the drivers."
bad,"Poor managment, supervisors more worried about things that don't matter and give no direction to new hires. Force jobs onto employees that aren't in their job desciption."
bad,"The job was easy and the benefits were great. The employees on the other hand, keep up a lot of unnecessary drama. Most of the people who work there are related also, so if you're not family you're not welcome"
bad,The management is unforgiving and do not treat their drivers with respect. They regularly yell at the workers and there is a general vibe amongst workers of a want to leave due to extreme micro management.
bad,"from day one working i had other employees wanting me to write bad letters to get someone fired."
bad,"working for ryder was fun everyone was upbeat and friendly i was having a good time working with the new hires the people thats already been working there dont seem to like the new hires too much it seems but who cares lol this job was laid back to the max like no stress,not fast paced,not a lot of interaction wit people.its jus the pay is wack if youre living with someone its ok but trying to make it on youre own youre not gonna make it my friend. less you work everyday. i ended up quitting along with my brother. this job is jus a stepping stone to finding a better paying job you get jobs quicker if you have a job thats what i did.there was 12 of us  that got hired when i quit it was 5 people left lol.they specifically told us theyre limiting direct hires cuz people always quitting or pointing out so they mainly do temps nowadays.as a temp youll make the same as a direct hire. theyre schedule is really good you work 5-6 days one week and be off 5 days the next unless you wanna work on ur days off theyll let you thats all i liked"
bad,"Had some bad experiences with different co-workers, One co-worker tried to physically hurt me with a heavy duty machine that was being operated by her, Then another co-worker presented a noose to me"
bad,If management take the time to address the bad seeds and get rid of them the company will be better. Employees are out to get everyone and rat on each other. No communication no team work
bad,Ryder is not a horrible company but the office in Roswell has poor management. They used to be a great place to work but the current management does not have the best knowledge of the department needs and has a call center with a high turnover rate mentality.
bad,Ryder Intergrated Logistics is ran by poor management. If you have any issues your complaints will be ignored. Management on all levels are men who frankly don’t care.
bad,"Worked as Transfer Driver out of Waterbury shop. It was easy (and low pay reflected that), but senior management gave little support to those who actually got things done. Meanwhile, they kept or promoted incompetents. Very political. One supervisor had no clue what he was doing, but then got promoted because of nepotism. Another supervisor knew his stuff, busted his butt for company, and was a talented young mechanic to boot, but the idiots in Hartford let him slip away because of their political BS. Company constantly harps, ""Zero tolerance."" But has one driver who has had incident after incident, speeding in customer's lot, accidents and didn't inform company, wastes tons of time stopping at convenience stores, etc, but management makes excuse after excuse to keep him. (And because he's supposedly on his last 'strike,' the snake tries to get his fellow co-drivers into trouble in multiple ways.) Meanwhile, if you are a good driver who does things in a safe, timely manner, but you get so much as a scratch on your arm that might need treatment, you are threatened with termination by the strong-arming regional manager. Totally backwards. Subsequently, turnover is rampant, at least in the Waterbury shop. This ends up putting much more work and strain on those still there, supervisors, techs, drivers, etc.. Over time this year, the place has become a mess.  Breakrooms and bathrooms are a disgrace because cleaning crew no longer comes. They can't even afford to pay landscapers to cut the little strip of grass in front of shop. Add it all up and it's not a good situation."
bad,Worst warehouse I've ever worked in. Politics and clicks everywhere. I'm glad I moved to Florida and left. They're awful. The leadership roles were a revolving door and often ill-suited or just over-stressed. I DO NOT recommend anyone to work in this company.
bad,If you want a deadend job with no advancement and the open door but never see us and we won't talk to you management this is the place for yo. Safety lacks so much so they actually have said since no one was killed why fix it. Money is good but find somewhere that will treat you like a human.
bad,the pay s good the only thing good about working there the management sucks they don't take time to talk to you if you have an issue they say they will but never do the hours suck they work employees to death sucks all around I was hired for material handler not case picker but they tried to train me on that I didn't like it .it really disappointed me thought it was going to be good place to work but it wasn't. overall bad
bad,"We warehoused parts for Volkswagen, but due to poor time management in the supervisors office, we no longer have a contract with Volkswagen. Once we lost the contract, no one had employment."
bad,The work was great as well as employees. As for the unbelievably poor way the management treated the employees... Different story completely. I learned a life lesson on how corporate greed has no limits on whom it will step on to better their bottom line.
bad,I really doesn’t have much to say about this job but if you willing to stand on your feet for ten hour or more this is the right place for you and if you will to work six day out of the week this is for you is a easy job but it’s real messy and you have some hating Peoples in here that they will do any and everything to make you lose your job
bad,"great pay,but company relies too much on temp services which means equipment is left to the next guy when its broken and tractors are dirty and finding proper documents can be a problem ,you have to cover your butt when driving past a scale because ryder wont , if you enjoy pulling your hair out ,its a great place to work , better bring a good truck gps too ,"
bad,"Warehouse is a very busy environment. Management isn't involved in the day to day operations. Employees are left to figure things out for themselves. Employees are forced to work 6 days a week while management only works 4. Even when you're told you will get a day off, they tell you the day before that's no longer an option and everyone is mandated."
bad,"Hired for customer service position told would be trained, was not then let go when failed to meet the job requirements.  Rude, racist ""managers"", depressing facilities. A revolving door of workers.  Mechanics berated and overworked, leading to missed deadlines and dissatisfied customers. Stay clear of this place!"
bad,They will not train new employees because they said they don't get paid to train. So you have to sit around and pick up what you can. The supervisors yell at other coworkers that are not part of management.  It's been brought to upper management's attention but once you do that your assignment has ended. It would be a great place to work for if they replaced the female supervisors.
bad,Over worked stressed out employees no support. Management only cares about numbers. I learned not to trust any of them with any thing you needed to talk about. The best part of the job was getting to know the people and having our own get together's out side the company.
bad,"Typical trucking company. Bait and switch. Promise you the moon to hire on then change everything once you go through orientation. "
bad,Definitely was too goo to be true. My direct manager actually had no experience in the work or field she was supervising. She had no idea how to manage a project or a team. It was unfortunate because there was a lot of talent on the team.
bad,I interview for a tech 2 position thought I was being hired as one 3 month end they told me I was a not a tech 2 but a utility worker I could only do pm and light repairs. 3 years later still doing pm. no chance for advancement. if you like change oil then this is a great place to work but if you want to work on truck then try somewhere else. union shop but the union sucks. if you do get hired get an offer sheet in writing saying what they are hiring you for and the work you will be doing. I told them in my interview that I did not want a job where all I did was pm and oil changes and would not be happy doing it. there answers was the have 600 trucks and there is plenty of work. still wanting for that work to come my way. lots of turn over in employee in the 3 years I have been there. I will be next
bad,"I worked for Ryder for a year plus the guys I worked with where great but the management was real bad and the safety in shop was not good because Ryder is to cheap to buy good shop tools like proper lifting equipment. "
bad,"I worked at the Bay Valley Foods warehouse in Rochelle IL and it was terrible. Let me start with how they lied on the job posting just to get you in... The 1 i applied to said “Forklift Operators Needed, Work 4 10hr days and enjoy a 3 day weekend"" Starting pay is $14.95... so that lured me in lol   They fail to say that you have to also drive a walkie and case pick too..If your familiar with warehousing you well know that thrs a HUGE diff between a walkie and a forklift.. A skilled forklift operator does NOT want to do an entry level position of lifting boxes all day, and wouldn't apply if they knew that. So now lets get to the orientation lol   i was in a group of 4 ppl and i was the only 1 with forklift experience smh. Now when training came around u got 2 days training on a high reach forklift/walkie which if ur unfamiliar with tht equipment is a little rushed. And when u start the actual job their performance system is based on scanning/moving 20 pallets per hour, which seems easy but thrs a catch lol   So they put you on a “ramp up period"" which lasts ur whole 90 days. You're 1st 2 weeks you must hit/maintain a 75% while ur training. If u dnt then u can get wrote up for it (idk how u can get wrote up while training lol).. and each week there after i moves up 5% till your at 100%.. now the catch to the performance is that theres a guy in the office who sends you all ur pick locations known as the Wave Planner.. he sends all the new ppl picks that are 15 isles away from each other.. Since the rate is 20 pallets an hour tht means 3 minutes per pallet.. when ur drive time too"
bad,"I am currently employed by Ryder in the midwest and it has been the worst job I have ever had, NEVER take the sign on bonus.  First off management makes it very well known that you as the individual worker are expendable.  No matter how much you do it is never enough,  Pay is horrible for a mechanic, after 2 years I can still start off at competing companies for almost $2 more per hour!  The hours are supposed to be set but vary so wildly you may as well not even have a schedule.  The ""recruiters""  promise the world to you and don't deliver the slightest.   Payroll is GOD AWFUL, every few weeks I have to call my boss because I am getting shorted on my check and it takes weeks for me to ever see the money.  I have had 1 raise in almost two years and that because my boss found out I was looking for another job, in his own words he said "" we can't lose you"" and then promptly gave me a .40 cent raise, still $2.00 lower than would I could start at with other jobs.  Benefits are okay but they cost so much that with the meager wages they provide you cant afford them.  "
bad,"This is not a company you would want to leave your current job for. The benefit package is the worst I have ever seen for a company this size. Even the HR guy over the SSC building does not use the health care package because the out of package (80/20) is too much for the employees to pay for the salary they are currently on (this was out of his mouth). There is no room for growth and many of the employees have been here so long with only a high school education and they say “It is the Ryder way”. So whatever you do, do leave your job for this place. I wish I had a time machine so I could deny the offer."
bad,"Threatened daily, write ups, no training,"
bad,"Management will tell you one thing but mean another.The jobs are physically demanding and hours are long.They don't care how long it takes you to get the job done but make sure you are back in time the next day to do it again.When you get a day off you will be sleeping all day.The plus side is the money is pretty good and you won't have time to spend it.Get use to ""if you don't do this your fired""."
bad,"Ryder as a whole is not a bad company to work for. This review is only for the Roswell location. When I used to work there I would see new people going in for an interview and I just wanted to tell them to run. I realize call centers have a high volume of work but management would not help out with anyone drowning in work at this center. Some agents would work 10 cases at a time. Others would work 70. And when you ask to have some help to evenly disperse them you would get denied because there is too much call/email requests coming in. Yet...they would not hire more agents. "
bad,I wouldn’t never work for a company like this without any care lights was out most of the time working overnight by yourself no security at all and I’m a female
bad,"Do not trust anyone in Ryder mgmt. I was fired for refusing to violate HOS. The other drivers were good to work with but mgmt. had no experience doing the job and most had never had a CDL. Had to drive my personal vehicle to each job assignment which included Athens, Mineral Wells, Elgin, Round Rock, College Station each week. Usually had to rig out truck upon arrival at each job location. They don't care about you, they only want product delivered. You can do better than this job."
bad,It was the unicorn of trucking jobs until the new management came in .... they started cutting from 5 days til 4 no raises and horrible health benefits .... the manager didn't like that i was making the hours i was so she cut my daya abs forced other drivers who would be off to run my route
bad,Bad management at location and Hr doesn’t care about the employees Hr doesn’t care about there employees. The less you do the more you lie the further you will get in this location.
bad,So you are given 5 paid sick days the day you start and in the winter if you slide off in a ditch your forced to use your sick days and if later on that year you get sick and end up in the hospital and have to stay a few days anything after there 5 days they will Wright you up even if you have a doctor's note I tryed to get it in weighting but they wouldn't put it in weighting because I would have sued them
bad,"Employees train employees, employees train managers and supervisor. Place is full of favoritism if u not cool with managers or kissing up you wont make it. Hr and Gm are very young and messy more he say she say drama come from them then the worker."
bad,"The job is extremely stressful and they show lots of favoritism. Most of the individuals in management barely know the concept of the job. Management is not professional at all. I can’t speak for any other location. However, the location in Shreveport, LA is horrible! Nothing is a secret with them, meaning you cannot confide in your boss because they tell everything and lie about what was actually discussed. Ryder has a high turnover rate, simply because of the management itself."
bad,They need to increase the pay because if only 42 hours you only walk home with 500 dollars and that cannot take care of a family. Ryders need to improve there pay for the yard jockey instead you have to kill off yourself to try and get a 1000 dollars. Thats wrong and should be reviewed by manager at least 25 an hour would satisfy the staff and we can go home with a descent pay. Stop stressing out your workers with dumb stuff watching there wvery move and causing more problem than is needed. While there is so many things wrong within the company.
bad,"Do not get a job here. They have a HIGH HIGH turn over rate which should tell you something. The management does not care to listen to anything you have to say. Management will lie to your face and then stab you in the back.  The pay is good,so if you dont mind the lousy hours, bad management, being stabbed in the back. Then this is the place for you."
bad,"If you like working overtime and putting in the extra effort go somewhere else. Very under staffed and impossible time requirements. Under payed for experience level. If your working on a truck at the end of the day they rather go through trouble of putting a driver in a sub than paying you an hour overtime to fix the truck. I’ve had to work late on several occasions to fix a truck but the next day forced to leave early so I don’t get overtime . They expect you to get 50-60hours of work a week done in 40 hours. If your looking for a place to move up forget about it, very hard to move up ."
bad,"Poor work site a lot of the workers are on drugs, and when you try to report problems retaliation follows. I worked here at the Jackson site for 2 years without issue. Within  a month of management change, I have been bullied to the point I am now off on FMLA  Stay clear"
bad,"In my situation, my co-workers were great people to work with and to know personally. But on the other hand, management can be unethical and untrustworthy. After working there for 8 years, all was well, until new management was put in place, in my opinion, to disband the workers union that was there. And the way management was attempting to do this, way by making it a place soo uncomfortable to work at, that the union employees that work there would want to leave, and then Ryder could bring in a whole new NON UNION crew. Ryder is all about controlling the workers 100%. No give and take, you just do everything they demand. No questions asked...or else."
bad,The job itself isn't bad but management is horrible. Rules and ot depends on who you are rather than your work ethics. No job security at all. If you get on their bad side they will make it hard on you so you will quit. Definitely would not recommend this job if you are looking for a long term career.
bad,They put customers before employees and everyone from supervisor to HR will lie right to your face. Good luck getting any parts or tools you need to finish a job and definitely don’t expect any of the reimbursements you’re promised.
bad,"Shift in management recently and you felt that you didn't matter and they were very disrespectful. No support. Manager at location was horrible and couldnt keep up with his work, hence you had to babysit everyone. Company doesnt care about their employees. No recognition after achieving 5 year milestone with company. "
bad,This is a job that is rewarding financially but very difficult to accomplish the goals that are set before you.  Ifthe staffing was a bit more robust then it would be better.
bad,Ryder seem to be a decent outfit to work for when I started with them. However management at the shop I worked at had their favorites and they were able to get away with anything. Also never had enough parts in stock to do our jobs correctly. Constantly running to retrieve parts then get scolded by management for not getting enough work done. Management does not take any responsibly and blames everything on the techs that work for them. Terrible morale in shop due to management constantly accusing techs of Padding Ro's and not working. Having too much time on activities. If you want to work here go ahead but be prepared for the constant bs and doing pm's all day. You will not advance at this location.
bad,Past forklift operator 2nd shift slow paced & not enough work through out your shift  barely get 40 hours a week no overtime is available bad management
bad,The job and management lacks communication so bad and treats their employees very bad. They'll right you up and get rid of you without you even knowing what you're doing wrong. They have temps training temps. They're too busy/ too lazy to help you succeed at your ultimate goal. They're only out for themselves.
bad,"Not typical 3pl.  Poor leadership and communication."
bad,They used to try and retain workers but that has changed. Policy against letters of reference. Worked 10 years and could not get a letter due to this policy.
bad,I did not enjoy my time within there company very much. Was unable to rely on upper mangement for any form or support regarding personal or implementing changes.
bad,"As a former technician, I wouldn't recommend this position to anyone. Too many managers hawking down on you, no raises or incentives. Once you join the company, they own you. Even on your personal time outside of work do example, you get penalized for driving infractions. Also, if you get hurt on the job, you will be at least suspended, and possibly terminated."
bad,the company its self may be good but the company that contracted them are not they are not fair to their employees and there is so much discrimination there it is ridiculous just was not happy there and they are losing more and more employees bay valley is who has contracted them not a good company at all
bad,I worked there for a total 4 months and i think they have poor mangement who couldn't meet the needs of my family life at home if you are a single parent with kids i wouldn't recommend you work there cause no excuse is tolerable and they don't try to meet the needs of your childrens schedule the pay was great but thats the only thing i liked about it
bad,Terrible work/life balance at the mcdonough location. Everything is mandatory even on the same day. Management doesn’t know what going on half the time. Site manager is new to warehousing 25yrs old hr 23yrs old
bad,Your on your feet walking all day and if you have the least sonority they make you stay over for the next shift they don’t care if you have a second job u don’t get any bonuses only once every 3 years the supervisors are a joke they literally don’t care about you it’s all about gm employees they threat Ryder people bad don’t join the union it’s all a joke they do not help you and if gm strikes Ryder ppl gets nothing while all the other companies do
bad,Management cannot be trusted to have your back.  Lots of hours with no personal life consideration.  They like to jump into things & work the bugs out as you go along.
bad,The supervisor doesn’t speak English.The manager is always yelling at you and cussing .I only put up with him because i needed the job.But employees he favors he won’t write them up.Which are the ones he hang around after work.Also he’s not from here!! Why can’t the company hire at least people that were born here!!
bad,Too much politics and favoritism. This is the only company I know where favored temps gets promoted twise in a row in 3 months. While hard working employees don't even get considered.
bad,Management basically forced me out...terrible...no advancement opportunities...supervisors were ok...HR onsite didn’t hv a clue about what was going on
bad,"The pay is above average but is offset by almost nonexistent medical coverage.Upper management is out of touch and clueless when it comes to running the company very highly compensated excutives hired outside bean counters to give them bad advice and drive out experienced techs,this to an already thin work force.Stay away unless you like working every weekend.It's the new policy."
bad,To work for Ryder expect to have no life away from the company. Horrible management!!! Would not suggest that company to my worst enemy. Nothing good comes out of working for the company
bad,"Lack of people to train, operations manager was the trainer and he was  a total jerk.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  Ladies in the office heard the trainer on the radio and says we are surprised you are still here.  When I talked with the HR person after I resigned, who heard the way the trainer talked to me, she says ""sorry it didn't work out.""  You want good people to work at Ryder, you need to treat them right and train them for the job they were hired to do."
bad,Mangers do not know how to communicate  with employees and customers bad planning  not enough time aloted on jobs por working conditions shop is always a mess
bad,"The terminal in Charlotte, NC near South Blvd is very discriminatory towards women drivers. Anytime I needed assistance with my equipment, it was always a job halfway completed. If it was necessary, ask someone there precisely how many women drivers work at this company. Sure anyone can stop by and check out how diverse the environment is on certain levels, but reality doesn't lie!! They offer fairly well rounded benefits, and a pay package that may seem feasible to some, but its still underlying factors that cannot go unnoticed !!"
bad,"Higher up really doesn't care about drivers. They say they have an open door policy until there is an issue. Just like you are the ""captain of the ship"" but try calling it and see what happens. Your just a paid puppet. You will be ok there as long as you shut up and do as your told and don't think for yourself! Some of these accounts are supposed to be local work, however, some people have to drive over an hour to get there and they don't take that into consideration when your supposed to have 10 hours rest!"
bad,"Then stay as far away as possible from Ryder. Unless of course you are in the management staff, then fill your boots. If you’re happy slogging away for little or no reward - but plenty of reward for the management team to claim on your behalf you will love it at Ryder. "
bad,Ryder logistics Yuma Arizona is a paycheck that is about it management has poor organization skills of loads management does not fix trucks in a timely manner they really don't care about a driver's needs or wants you are just a number and if they advertise their trucks are not best in class or best in the fleet nobody's rude or inconsiderate I would not consider this job a local position most of the time you work your shift go home go to bed get up go right back to work you have no time to relax or see family take care of your children going home it's just a bed for you but if you're looking for a paycheck and have no family life or outside of work life working for Ryder Yuma is for you
bad,"I put my start date as 2014, the year ryder took over the contract, although I have been at top pay myself prior to takeover."
bad,"What is basically a trucking company with software that isn't really designed to manage a trucking company.  Excellent pay, although you really earn every bit of it.  You have your standard work that is expected to be done on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, the normal work that is the business, and then you have extras added from local and regional levels without consideration of your current work load.  Get assignments that cannot be done with the resources given, with increasing pressure from local and regional management to get the work done."
bad,A typical day at work involved getting our assignments in the morning while the foreman made dirty comments. Practical joking was part of the culture of the warehouse. Routine safety rules were constantly broken. Some of the work was hard but for the most part it was enjoyable. There was a substantial amount of drug use on site as well.
bad,"My day starts at 6:30 in the morning at which point i must check my load on the truck, check which stops i have for the day and plan my route to ensure i get my stops done in the most efficient way possible. Depending on the number of stops I usually come back, get unloaded and then load up any returns that need to be delivered. My day usually ends between 5 and 5:30"
bad,Not a good company for someone starting out in a career. Poor management from the top down make Ryder a very frustrating company to work for. More concerned with pleasing shareholders then treating employees with dignity and respect.
bad,Would be better if they had new management upper and lower if that warehouse didnt have a lead person no one would attempt the columbia sc location AT&T need another contractor in columbia sc
bad,All i heard was grown men that been working there for many years over 20 complain on the daily tip.it use to be a good company to work for. They eliminayed pensions in 2007 just like every othe corporation. Your just a number. They expect you to work on every kind of truck out there so you never get to master anything..sucks.. Maybe up north is better cause i heatd they have unions there. But if you in the south prepare to be swamped...
bad,"Performed my job well but,because I was beautiful the women hated me. Management isn’t any help!! The Haitians are Clannish. The Hispanics are evil. Overall not a positive environment."
bad,"If I did not have union benefits I would not work for Ryder as company benefits are worthless, Ryder is all about numbers. there is no communication, no worthwhile training. Management seems to be focused more on micro managing than getting the work done,  trucks that should be in the shop are given back to the customers, parts can only be ordered though specific places saving neither time nor money, that being said,, The pay is decent and the union benefits are good which is why I'm still working there."
bad,"After years of conducting research, one cannot express the frustration that comes with seeing all your work go neglected by superiors with alternative agendas."
bad,"As with many 3pl, much is based on the account you would be working with / in.  Before you accept a position with Ryder at a specific site do as much research on the client Ryder is supporting at that location and the customers involvement. "
bad,"Pack out as many orders as possible during my shift in order to make the company happy and our customers by making sure we are shipping them the correct amount and part. "
bad,"The absolute Most boring job I have ever had so far. The money means nothing when you can’t stay awake at your desk because of nothing to do , supervisors offer no guidance, one is clueless and the other is just a complete d head"
bad,"If you like being fairly compensated, working 40 hours, enjoying your job, feeling like you matter, having job security, and having affordable insurance, look elsewhere. If none of those things matter to you, and you much prefer that corporate makes billions off of your labor, go ahead and sign up right now! I'm positive there's an opening near you, right now. If not, wait a few days. I'm sure someone will have enough by then."
bad,"Ryder do not care about its employees. They have pert management. High turnover in office. Managers come in with hidden agendas & will threatend your job. "
bad,"No over time just 40 hours, if you work hard they don’t appreciate you. Back stabbers, management is no good they don’t know nothing. They till you one thing then go underneath the supervisor desk. Kiss assess"
bad,"Union sucks there, and management don't listen to the employee,  management lie a lot, won't give you class to move up but give you higher T grade work."
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years and have seen people come to work on drugs and not be fired, just given the opportunity to go to rehab and keep their job. I have heard employees cuss out the supervisor(s) and not be reprimanded. I have seen employees walk out on the job and still be employed. I was a punctual employee and was very dedicated to my job. I had been asking my supervisor to take care of the situation with my partner, who had cussed me on the job, and instead of the problem being taken care of I was fired and on my separation notice was given a bad rap. So unless you like to be over-worked and under-paid and discriminated against I suggest you don't work for Ryder."
bad,"dispatcher is the problem here at this location"
bad,"Work here for a year and relocated my family for this Company for Diesel Tech 2, the absolute worst decision I ever made...this company doesn't keep promises, and no advancement to grow or succeed and horrible management"
bad,Every work area must be comfortable in other for all employee to work in a stress free environment and makes good production for the busniess
bad,"After 4 hours of training on the first day in the Warehouse I was left alone to do the job.  Having to reboot the computer system every time the computer crashed, and having to write down every minute was time consuming. The previous order was lost and even though you start back to work. The way the Warehouse pull order system could be reorganized to run more efficiently. The job I was hired for is not the job that actually had me doing."
bad,"RYDER is the worst place to work on earth, the union sucks the hr sucks the co workers start drama I would never recommend this job to anyone ever the only beneficial thing to this hole is the pay and that's it !"
bad,Worked for Ryder and was let go for attendance.  Company wasn't informed I was hospitalized
bad,"Do not accept the job ! They do not want a manager they want someone to blame as they go about thier own agenda . Ryder is kown as a good place to work, unfortunatley they have a (GM) in the North east that runs off anyone that knows what they are doing so that he is placed high above all and all that work under him must praise him as a god or he will do you in. Says alot about the upper-management and HR as they call him the ""Golden Boy""."
bad,Will do nothing about dust problem just another big company who doesn't care. Needs a watertruck desperately. Rents shop from contractor that does very little to take care of property.
bad,"Answering phone calls, seeing if orders got delivered, printing truck drivers bills, printing more papers.I also checked voicemails, had to sometimes walk in the ware house to make sure something wasn't still left in the back."
bad,"I really appreciate for  opportunity, and thanks for allowing me get into new opportunities. It was an amazing experience and I'm sure Ryder will continue to be one of the best companies."
bad,lack of communication between management and the rest of the employees. Over all too  many hands in the cookie jar. Company itself offers amazing benefits if non union.
bad,"The whole management team including HR Recruitment needs to be purged and replaced with employees that no how to communicate, do their jobs with a heart and respect all backgrounds. They need people that actually want to make a difference, not come to work to do NOTHING and think they are doing something to benefit the company. These employees are don't have ACCOUNTABILITY mindset."
bad,The yard on Wallisville in Houston Texas is always full there's nowhere to park. The company lost the contract I was on on no fault of the drivers. They didn't want to maintain the medical coach. I hate we got laid off because people in the front office didn't do their jobs but they still have a job I would not work for Ryder again
bad,A company that looks good on paper that is all I have to say... If you want a good paying call center Ryder Roswell is the place. If you want to work for snakes then Ryder Warranty is the place.
bad,It's okay if you like 4 on 4 off days and nights  it's not that great and the manager isn't really into helping the guys get what they need to do their job better and has one driver that shouldn't have a job but is scared to fire anyone
bad,They suck as an employer. They claim captain of the ship and it’s a lie. If you are injured they fire you. They have their suckers that are up their fears and friends like my roomate they would make me take the routes he wouldn’t want to do cause they were friends outside the job. They tell your personal information to like my roomate and make fun of people that have legal disabilities and then when you make a complaint they team up and lie on you and say you do stuff you don’t do but make no mention of the illegal thins gs they do
bad,"Employee carry gun throughout shop and keeps gun in his locker during his shift. Numerous complaints to management and shift supervisors and still nothing.  Drivers, customers and shop employees shared pictures of employee carrying holstered gun with upper management due to unsafe environment. Would be a great workplace only if it was safer with NO GUNS!"
bad,Worst place ever. Management is less than useless. They nag micromanage accuse and treat the employees like children at best. Most of the time they treat the employees like criminals. Don’t waste your time here.
bad,"I found the environment to be a pretty unhappy one. Computer systems and office equipment were very dated, extremely slow and hindered employees carrying out their roles. Management seemed quite detached from the hindrance that staff faced from the poor facilities available to staff."
bad,The culture at this place is a me 1st one. No one cares and why should they when the company could give a rats azz! They are all a bunch of bean counters trying to run a transportation company.
bad,"I was consistently asked to drive past one or more customers to deliver at another customer then back track to the other customers there by adding  many extra unnecessary hours to my day.  Management had no idea or concept of the trucking industry at all.  They used Drive Cams on the windshield like nanny cams to ""program behaviors"" and if they seen something they didn't like a member of the management staff with no cdl, no tractor trailer experience, no qualifications, no training, and no experience would ""coach"" you on how to drive.  I have 3 million miles accident free experience, and management who has never been in a truck or behind the wheel of one was going to tell me how to drive one.  The shuttle trailers wouldn't get back to us until late morning and then we were expected to drive 2 hours to our first delivery and then start making 10-12 deliveries with a tarped flatbed with an average of 30-45 minute travel time between deliveries and the get it all done before customers closed.  Ryder has big problems and instead of fixing them they are focusing all their energy and time on the nanny cams in the trucks.  Monumental Stupidity most accurately describes Ryder"
bad,"Only way to advance was if you were a guy. Work/life balance sucked. Management did not have your back, ever. The only way you knew you were doing something well was that they weren't yelling at you about it"
bad,"Had issues with the on board computer in the new truck they got. It would log you on/off whatever it felt like. Management did not want to hear the truth, but would rather belive a malfunctioning computer. Fire you like you didn't matter."
bad,"Stay away from the jci account, you will regret it, they are not organized at all, they tell you one  thing and do another. We were told there was a yearly pay raise, never received it, guarantee pay is taken away to suit their needs (bonus for management ), as for the Toyota account, it is by bid only, you will stay at the bottom until you move up to the good routes which pay over 900, which will take a long time if it ever happens, driver turnover is high for a reason."
bad,"New management! I really do not have very much to say about this location. You would literally have to walk in my shoes to even begin to understand how I feel about this location. I'm very disappointed, sums it up."
bad,Bad place to work. Poor Management. Don't care about employees. Low wages. Red tape and politics. Hostile environment.
bad,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop as an employee. With a fortune 500 company there is a lot of red tape and politics but that is to be expected of a company this size.
bad,"Someone posted about the Liverpool, NY CLM position above and they are 100% correct. The people in charge are liars and incompetent. They do not train, communicate, or even warn you of what their agenda may be. If they decide they don't like you, your gone, regardless of progress. I left a good career at another competitor, for 4 weeks. They started lying after 2 weeks, about what their intentions were. I've lost my home because of their disregard for common courtesy. They lie to your face and then let you go. Why Ryder employ's people with personal agendas, is totally agaist what they preach. Stay away.. To many chiefs, no indians."
bad,"The management is horrible."
bad,Now I know why their always looking for drivers. These people just don't know what their doing.
bad,I was a temp for this company when they were trying to break the union. They treated me like I was someone that was wasting air.
bad,"Horrible place to work. No personal time they own you. Shop is dirty, floor needs to be painted"
bad,dont have anything nice to say!! nothing nicei really dont have anything to say about ryder
bad,"They throw over time at you at the last minute and make you stay, for the low man on the totem pole it sucks. The jobs are usually too hard for one person to do they need to put more people on the job, but they'll just give you one."
bad,It was a great place to work I wish my time there was longer it was a experience and I found working hand to hand with a partner in such a tight place was also a experience
bad,"It is overall a good company to work for.  Just don't fall for the 800.00 a week guarantee.  They do not honor it.  You will for sure work nights for a long while.  The manager is very cool and works with everyone. The problem is upper management.  They are more worried about safety this and safety that than keeping drivers.  Also plan on having about 3 weeks off without pay for sure.  Plus any other time they decide to cancel runs, also without pay.  Like I said, they do not honor the so called guarantee pay."
bad,"Literally. I worked at a Ryder as the only English speaking employee on the floor. I was hired on as a fork lift driver and spent my three months there order picking with a walkie. Never made rate, and I am a crazy hard worker. No one was helpful. Only worried about themselves to make the rate. Basically you couldn't help without falling short. Shined on the fork lifts but they wouldn't place me on one for more than one day in a month."
bad,best job I ever had WORST Company I have ever worked for.. good pay great equipment.. just not a driver friendly company ! My manager in Louisville is a great guy always has his drivers back..but all of his bosses are always b usting his butt for standing up for drivers.. Ryder Corparate only cares about their custermers mloney and that's it
bad,"Ryder is great as a temporary job. If your endgame is college, I would recommend working here for a couple of weeks. I wouldn't stay at Ryder for longterm. The pay isn't high enough for that."
bad,Ryder is a contracted company. No job security.  Not a lot of accounts in the north ga area. Pay is not where it should be for class a drivers. Raises are very few and far between.
bad,"i did not have a good experience here. unfair management. they didnt care about your family or home life, work every saturdy no matter how long you work there"
bad,"Ryder is a terrible place to work. The bosses don't listen to you. They badmouth you. Write you up for no reason and break every law possible. Other than that, it is a great place to work."
bad,This was a great opportunity I seen myself moving up in the company as I put time and effort into what I thought would benefit me. Management dropped the ball and things just went down hill. Many complaints have been made to HR in reguards to ALL the managers and nothing has been done.
bad,Poor workplace with poor management. Only did holiday activities with first shift workers. Never did holiday food days with second or third shift people.
bad,Management is terrible. If you have something fall over they will just drive by and not help. Look and laugh. They stay in office all day and use office as a frat house yet whine about numbers but hardly do anything to help out. Favortitism is heavy. Some always get easy work and some always get stuck with the hard stuff. If you're a smoker you have to walk clean to the road to smoke a cigarette. They have 8 bathrooms there but only 2 open. Management hardly take their job seriously....until numbers are getting bad then its an issue. Rumors galore. Health insurance isn't very good.
bad,"I  transferred from another ryder ,and my pay went from 18.00hr to 14.00 hr after working for the company for 6 yrs .I have never seen a company so disorganized and predict ,Verizon will go with another company to provide  services. Ryder will lose this contract unless they get there act together."
bad,Management doesn't take care of you never have a answer for you but love to give u writtens or write ups Ryder is a very good place to work if they had the right management.. I loved this job but the new management makes u wana quit
bad,This company did not warn the employees about losing the contract with homedepot. They let the time expire and the employees had to just deal with the fall out.
bad,"horrible place to work ,dumb managers ,all play no one take the job seriously , slow customer service, no job security ,no leadership"
bad,ryder does not care about its workers. management did not communicate well. very stressful. very short breaks. will not recommend this company to anyone else
bad,Never told you in advance if you had mandatory overtime that day.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of being very busy
bad,It doesn't matter how well you know the position.  If you're not someone buddy you won't advance at springhill GM plant. It's sad to say that but  it's  true.
bad,"Mediocre management done by mediocre manager at Milton. No planning whatsoever, everything is a reaction! as above: Don't trust anyone. Don't make mistakes. If you did, blame someone else! Overtime is abused like no tomorrow. Yet, a good start hiring new top, then get rid of the wannabes."
bad,I work for Ryder in Fontana small facility not too many employees. They show a lot of favoritism management doesn’t really know what they’re doing very stressful working in a place like that
bad,Los jefes son misóginos y prefieren a un hombre más q a una mujer en un puesto alto
bad,If u need a job and u pick this place... Just do your job and say nothing and go home. CDL holders have way less to worry about.......................
bad,"Terrible work life balance, terrible pay, and no consistency with management, There is a group of 4 managers that are all best friends, so if you have an issue with one of them then you have an issue with all of them and they will ruin your career there."
bad,"Poor upper management.  Too much mirco managing. Job description is NOT whats promised in scope of work, does not pay for job expected of you.  You are expected to do all upper management duties as a CLS including payroll, but 2 grade levels lower pay."
bad,The 12 hour shifts were mandatory. After 8 hours you are overworked and become unproductive. You don't get much needed work breaks. Management shows favortism.
bad,"Not a good place to work with current leadership team. Have no idea running the Operations. If employees as in the click With them They do wrong and no discipline issue and unethical practices. Ops managers and general manager turn their heads to the other side and don’t want to deal with the problems. "
bad,"horrible , all management does is try to find ways to get employees fired when they're board. Most employees are doing jobs they are not even getting paid for. Management says ""hey we need you to learn how do this just to help us out"". You constantly pick up new things but as long as they don't like you , you will stay a minimum wage employee."
bad,Extra board Driver's will be used and abused will be on different shifts and most will be night or early morning shifts Was told Imay have to go to Clarksville or Bowling green in my personal vehicle to cover drivers who will be off or no shows dispatch is a joke but money waa ok.
bad,"Ryder has different accounts throughout Florida especially in Orlando. Since CLM and CLS left in the past year , new senior manager is not hands in the day to day operations in the Distrubuting center location. "
bad,"Reviewed daily workload to ensure all tasks are accomplished in required time, provided guidance to fork lift drivers regarding loads.  Verified all product was available to apply to outgoing loads.  Coordinated loose pick order for LTLs."
bad,Terrible management no communication HR department in tatters did not care about contract terms nor were they willing to uphold contract. The work environment was good but poor leadership for management
bad,People are spoken too in a hostile manner. it is a churn 'em and burn 'em environment. Management will make changes without thinking about how you feel and where your strengths are.
bad,Change is good when it beneficial for the company and employees but working 60+hrs a week six or more months things like lack of sleep and changes of simple job task that makes doing the job harder than it was shown makes the working environment tense and  hostile I've had a manager tell me directly to my face the not only was he petite but the next time he see my was going to be the last time i didn't know rather to take it serious or was he just playing either the case considering the work hours and lack of sleep to work there it feel like prison.i still currently work there but im looking for other employment.
bad,Managers do not communicate with each other to make the job easier to leave the warehouse and return at a good time routing is terrible leading semis into restricted areas leaving drivers to try to figure out a way around the area to get to the destination wrong type of trailer for the type of job  needed lack of customer information leading to arrival or appointment times needs more work and better training for managers
bad,the site manager is a good guy the place is often changing shift schedules and moving shifts around which does cause issues in the outside life if your and active person out side of work
bad,"Wasn't anything in place when I started there. But, it did get better eventually. It started getting a little better the last year. It started slowing down some. The planners at Volkswagen are nothing but dummy's And still another 3 years later. They are still dumb!!! After over 6 years these dummies they still cannot perform their jobs correctly. Enough is enough when they cause people to lose their jobs over their own ignorance!!"
bad,"PPAP Technicians review PPAPs identify any missing paperwork that pertain to PPAP level and inspect part. Part must be conforming to blue print requirements. Contact supplier for paperwork issues. Contact quality engineers for changes or any questions about a parts and blue print. "
bad,"Like most huge companies, Ryder is great when you first get started, but you are just a number to them.  They lean toward hiring young, just out of school people so they can pay them less and use them more.  I was an older person, so as soon as the younger ones were trained my position was eliminated.  I did all the jobs that no one else wanted to do and still got eliminated.  I loved the work itself and it was a challenge that was fun and fulfilling."
bad,"worked for this company a little over a year and they made a lot of promises they couldn't keep. we were told that we would be rolled into Chrysler and that didn't happen, as well as job placement once our jobs ended and that did not happen at all!"
bad,"Only if you like being a work horse with barely days off, then I'll suggest this place to you. If not, do not work here. You are undervalued, over worked and under paid. The job it self is a bit complex but management incorporate unnecessary standardize processes to extend your already 10 hour work load."
bad,Working there you never knew when you were going home.  The supervisor was unfair.  They made overtime mandatory and that was not in the contract.  No room for growth.
bad,"This job would not have been so stressful if the LLC would have not been prone to hysterics.  She threw a fit about every little thing and always had the office staff and often customers in state of chaos.  The general manager,however,was level headed and the one to go to if you needed assistance on anything. The people I worked with were bright and quick and fantastic, the work load was heavy.  The hours (5am-13:30) were brutal."
bad,I have been working for Ryder as a Material Handler since June .They came in seeming to be a place you might want to retire from .Ryder just came to this location in june as a contract company inside of a bigger company.There was alot of unaswered questions pertaining to salary .But dispite the uncertainty I put faith in what they was saying .Now it has been almost 4 months in and I forget to put a lock on a trailer . They done a investigation and it was pretty much cut and dry .I thought I had put a lock on the trailer because I  didnt see them behind my seat on the forklift .A typical mistake ...Only human right . So I was retrained and re certified .I also recieved a write up and was given 2 RAB's which mean ( Risk Associated Behavior ) I was informed that if I got three I would be terminated . I then returned to work . Now here it is 2 days later and another individual forgets to put a lock on a trailer ; Which is understandable since we are pressured to get a certain amount of trucks out on our shift and they monitor your down time and breaks . Struggling to keep up with there expectations and be safe AND most importantly Dont forget anything .Anyway after another individual forgot to put a lock on the trailer they chose to suspend him depending on investigation ..Im sure it will turn up he forgot . In my case I thought I did  ; But I didnt .So since they suspended him they chose to reopen my case that had been resolved and suspend me also depending on a re investigation of the previous investigation .I know it dont make since to me either .The point Im trying to make is
bad,Long hrs with management that is very out of touch with customers needs. Ryder doesn't provide the tools to meet the customers expectations. High turn over. Cut throat place to work. I was a service manager for Ryder and I would not recommend working for them. Dishonest upper management.
bad,"The driving part of the job is easy as I gets. Sadly, management/dispatcher is left in the hands of a kid who knows very little about what is involved with driving a commercial vehicle. Is more focused on moving freight rather than the company’s policies and safety rules that he likes referring to anytime it’s suits him. Anytime he takes time off, everything runs smoothly and driver morale is considerably higher."
bad,"If you get in with a click your OK, if not, once you move up they will move you out. Upper Management will put who they want in a position no matter how much experience you have.  Would not recommend working at Ryder."
bad,Management sucks and the job is easy a lot of favoritism if they like you if not they make you quit and give you write ups and qfb the managers r dicks
bad,The supervisor's and crew were awesome. Very little drama. Where the problem kicks in is at HR and upper management. Rules are not the same for all people. All depends if you're liked or not. Expect double mandatory days often even when work does not call for it. One day they just mandatory you just to clean. If you have no family of life this is a good job. If you want family time then you may want to look past this one.
bad,"Management is a joke and so are the trainers for the position be prepared to be dumped in any slot they need a warm body, The amount of personal going through Toyota Georgetown plant is crazy. Instead of fixing the situation they just send guys through yard jockeys positions"
bad,"They put cameras in the cab of the truck and would spy on you as you drive.  Would also listen in to whatever you were saying.    No respect for seniority.   They management would lie to you about how much the other routes were paying.   for example, one route got a guarantee of 750 a week for less than 16 hours work.  I worked 40 or 50 and got paid per stop and miles,  no guarantee.  so if the were less stops, I'd be paid less than the other drivers guarantee.  When I put 2 week notice in,  The stopped talking to me."
bad,"under different management and better training this could be a very fine place to work, however as it is currently run there are many improvements that would need under taken to bring this up to pleasurable work place."
bad,"Poor upper management and HR. CLS Job description is NOT whats promised in scope of work, does not pay for job expected of you. You will do the same job as 2 pay levels above the CLS, work 6  12-16 hr days, and throughout the night."
bad,The managers don't care about you. They don't know how to keep track of their information and the co-workers are so toxic. So if you want to work at a warehouse. just apply at amazon.
bad,"There are many reports that need to get done in a monthly basis, i manage all recruiting and payroll aspects of the company, all temp employees as well. Hiring and Firing process, and some account payable as well"
bad,I was really excited to work for this company but it soon turned out to be a disappointment. a typical work day was me pulling reports and updating information no one else felt the need to. I did learn a little bit about tracking and tracing but not enough to be proficient. Management are the people who stayed below the radar long enough to gain tenure but unfortunately that didn't qualify them to lead. They have an extremely high turnover rate not to be a call center. The hardest part of the job was the narrow minded personalities and the learning curve of not being trained. I was brought on through a staffing agency and promised  tempt to hire and was offered $15 as starting pay. Everyone is afraid of getting fired so there is a tension there can be cut with a knife. There is little to no training on what the work process is and no one can or will give you a clear answer to how anything really works. Their benefits package is laughable and not worth sticking around for since you're basically on a 90 day probation before you can enroll. The commute is taxing no matter what part of DFW you live in since it's practically in the middle of nowhere. Working there was like being in the twilight zone because it was a wonder the place functioned. Their headquarters is located in Michigan I believe and I feel that is part of the problem with communication. But who knows problems tend to trickle down. This is the place to be if you need to get caught up on any audible books though.
bad,"ryder is an ok place if you like to be a pet for management."
bad,Facility in Streetsboro is terrible. Bad management. Horrible hours. Always scheduled overtime even when more workload is done than other shifts.  Work environment is terrible. Work in a freezer that always stay at 0° or below. Case pickers get the worst of it.
bad,"This is a self destructing job. Management is a joke. They sit in the office all night and rarely work, but are there to hand out write ups for not doing everyone's else's jobs. "
bad,Too many metrics and very poor leader comunication. Ryder senior management provides very little to no real support to the people below them who actually do all the work.They will cut jobs if they don't like you and or eliminate your job and force you into a lesser role or leave. This adds many more tasks to others who are already overburdened.
bad,"If your looking for a company who treats you as a number, has a sink or swim training method this is your dream job!"
bad,"Worked there for almost 2 years, trained almost everyone who came in the door, never received a dollar for trainers pay then they created this position for trainer and i applied and was not even interviewed after applying, they gave that position to an employee they favored, favortism ran high on the job with the favored doing minimum work and everybody unfavored pulling the workload while the favored relaxed and watched"
bad,The lack of communication by leadership with folks on the floor is non-existent. The shift times change on a near monthly basis and 40n hours are not truly guaranteed for the folks the employees on the floor. The leadership is disengaged and are not open to new ideas and listening to those closest to the job and hurdles that are faced on a daily basis. Cliques and favorites run rampant and those who are in the good graces of the few get the time off requested.
bad,Management  have  lack of knowledge on the procedures on how a warehouse environment is suppose to be run. They do not train employees very well. They don't like to hear suggestions from the employees on how to make the work environment a better place to work.
bad,"Senior Management did not follow through on training promises, did not communicate with managers. Managers were held accountable for policies they were not trained on or aware of. They do not care of they drop an account or remove people there are always more is the attitude."
bad,I had to sue them because management an the HR person were so unprofessional. I won my case an the only black manager was fired who had nothing to do with my situation horrible place to work.
bad,"Fast paced credit control department working with archaic computer systems. No loyalty to staff from senior management. No Christmas party, no bonuses, no perks what so ever. Some amazing people work for Ryder but they go unappreciated"
bad,the hours fluctuate every with no incentive raises or potential for growth. whether you work there for ten years as a stand up employee or one month you will all be viewed the same.
bad,"Typical day with Ryder began with monitoring a case incident que. To determine what issues have been recently reported and the severity for the issue reported. Escalation from the two lower levels would involve the team I was part of when resolution could not be found. Contacting the customer location reporting the incident and gather as much information as required. Determination if the issue reported is process or product. If the issue is replicated then the vendor that designed the software would be contacted for a bug fix. If and when the vendor corrects the issue, it would be tested on a identical mirrored test environment before migration into the production system. The testing and migration requires approval and dates of action set."
bad,"Company has potential. Management can never seem to remember what they say, that or they claim they don't remember do they can get out of their promises. Work schedules are inconsistent. They will tell you you will work 3/4 12 hour days but mandate you 6. They do not care that you have a wife or children at home."
bad,"We open a warehouse in Hebron Ky in sept 2016 the manager are arrogant and the groups leaders are too,. 50 to 60 hours force on  u without notice. communication is terrible, Managers have no respect for associates, they use alot of temps, and fire the full timer, no sonority means nothing there, Temps can come in and get a better job, then the full timers, and Benfits are not that good. Even if the handbook says you get certain holidays off, they will work you, and if you don't show up your pointed, and lose both holiday pays"
bad,"Ryder is a horrible company to work for racist managers  they try to promote fairness , it just a bunch of bull  it slave  environment  Managers have chip on their  shoulders. Quick too write you up co workers act like a bunch little girls it's a lot of jealousy with different coworkers quit to tell on you"
bad,"you are a number not any thing there only to make momey for the"
bad,I was in charge of about 15 to 20 people and had to turn about 50 trailers a day. I had to make sure the equipment was running properly to ensure that the production line didn't stop.
bad,"This was an over the road trucking job that would take every opportunity to exploit their workers.  They took advantage of inexperienced truck drivers by pressuring them into leasing/renting their trucks.  They would pay you very little and run you into the ground.  You would work four to six weeks, before coming home for four to six days.  They would look for every opportunity to hold your pay, even if it wasn't your fault (like a mechanical issue with the truck)."
bad,Too much is put on you if you show you can do it and they will never compensate you for the extra effort. Very non-incentive based company with too much drama and personal relationships. Warehouse is very dirty and falling apart. There is nothing enjoyable about the job and the hardest part of the job is walking through the door everyday.
bad,"arrive before 7am leave by 3:45pm"
bad,"The driver manager (makes my stomach turn referring to him as that) has zero tolerance for your problems (lack of hours primarily). I can't speak for all Ryder facilities, but do yourself a favor and stay away from Fontana."
bad,Very hot. I learned how to drive a forklift. Management was not fun at all. Co workers were the best part about the job I have made so many friends. Hardest part was waking up and deciding if I wanted to go to work. Most enjoyable was getting off work.
bad,"seems they don't care about anyone that isn't management, co-works will throw you under the bus in no time. Basically this place is joke to work at they don't try to advance you at but they will tell you otherwise, benefits suck hardcore the only good thing is the vacation you get that's it..."
bad,drove for 12 years on different accounts i have had good managers and bad most of them make their own rules as they go but the worst part is when the account ends ryder wont give you any notice or help you find another account your on your own the last four years on this one they would not give us any pay raise or new uniforms Ryder policy states five shirts a year we got none in that time dispatch piled on the stops we were req. to take lunch and breaks we had to enter them in to people net ele. log so they knew that we took them was told that next year that video cams going into trucks to watch driver and road
bad,not a good work balance very difficult to advance in company.
bad,Long hours and not enough pay.. Trucks weren't repaired when wrote up but you were expected to continue to use them
bad,They say a lot of good things but their actions don't match what they say.  Loads are messed up.  Pallet jacks are mostly broken down.  Trailers need service.  Lift gates don't work
bad,"Ryder boasts being a top place to work and its just not true."
bad,company will hire anybody with two hands and two legs. No logic in day to day working schedule. No real leadership other then mangers making letting you know about changes in work policy last minute
bad,You will bid on you routs. You will be paid a flat fee for a full weeks work. You are a number. It will take you a long time to get a permanent route. Extra board work will be what you can look forward to.
bad,The work culture at rider is only their bottom line.  No pay raises yearly everything is based on the route instead Of fair pay across-the-board one way management  drivers input doesn't matter.
bad,I would break down on an average of 2 times a week. The equipment was newer stuff but the issue was it took on average 6 to 8 hours to put you back on the road which you were paid a low rate of $15 an hour. Not worth it. Management at the Elgin TX plant was not even close to being a manager. I had to do most of his work. He was pretty much just a office staff person. Not sure why he was in his position because he had no idea about trucks or how to do our job.
bad,"I do not wish to share any of my personal experience with this company on a review. I was not provided the option to skip this review, however, I have no comments to make at this time."
bad,I enjoyed working for Ryder but management is not a team. Not enough training for your position.Higher up management keeps you out of loop unless it benefits them.
bad,"Constant turnover with drivers here. All drivers are either new (-soon to be former) or outsourced from temp agencies. Job seems simple when presented, but nothing could be further from the truth. Poor technology, inane work processes, and performance  expectations will quickly drive you to the breaking point on the road. Location of facility is in one of the worst parts of town for traffic. Low morale and mostly bitter staff, due to all the company cost cutting and lack of strong leadership from management.  Below avg pay, long hours, and subpar benefits. Keep looking."
bad,"The front office is a disaster they don't care about others life you work and give more than 100% and still don't care , they will send you to any shift even if you don't like if not the door is open."
bad,"I have worked with Ryder for about 2 years now and I highly dislike the management they have and how they treat the employees. Completely unfair and solely based on favoritism. I don not recommend working for this company, HR is corrupted as well."
bad,I liked working there but was forced out by union politics. Could have moved with the company but didn't want to move to Tennessee and lose all seniority.
bad,"Fue una buena empresa que ofrecía plantas en poco tiempo actualmente hay personal con tres años sin derecho a planta los descansan para no dar antigüedad ya con planta las prestaciones son buenas no exelentes utilidades poco realistas al volumen de mercancía que manejan es buen empleo para los que quieren aprender diferentes áreas de la logística lo malo tienes que lidiar con jefes poco capacitados y muy ocurrentes"
bad,Good job when it was millard. Ryder is not organized and is not employee friendly. Management is cut throat amd your private information sometimes seems to be public information. The general manager needs employee sensitivity training.
bad,This place is a joke management plays favorites to certain works they refuse to supply you with equipment you need treat workers like children impossible work quotas always say they are hiring but they're not they pick and choose this place is only good for a check not a career
bad,"Too many short breaks, unprofessional supervisors and team leaders. I could be better and should be better. Unbalanced man attendance. It's ridiculous"
bad,"Felt like no one there was on the same page because each person completed the same tasks differently and I witnessed many differences as they did."
bad,"Very lazy HR person in London , never there , always says she is busy when you want to see her , and she thinks she runs the company , but she should be in rehab.  Drivers all nice , but using agency drivers reflects a bad image on the customers. Too many people in management have been there too long and can't think outside of the box. Too many EGOS and internal relationships between males and the female ."
bad,"A typical work day at Ryder is no less that nine hours of hard work. In my four years at Ryder, I've learned that males are paid 20% more than females for performing the same jobs. Some managers lack the leadership skills to lead. The hardest part of the job is not being able to approach your manager to share ideas or concerns without fear of retribution. If you are looking for a temporary position until a permanent position is available, then Ryder is the place for you."
bad,"I loved my job, but the customer was very demanding.  Everyday was different, which is hard if you have a deadline to meet for your company.  If you get pulled in too many directions your entire day goes by and you  have accomplished nothing on your to do list."
bad,"10 to 15 hours per day with lack of gratitude from Director level and above."
bad,"after 18 years of been work for the company, not much to say, there is a lack of getting better or improved.There is not much to say, after so many years of work, I started and I finish in the same level, experience I got more than enough for my position. That was all."
bad,great company if you know how to wear a skirt... specially some departments... some people should not be managers and do not know how to manage well... they like to micromanage and have favorites.  They do not put in time and make false statements...
bad,"Pay is ok, as are the benefits. Management treats employees like children. They make an easy job very stressful. Shift(your scheduled time to work) is not gaunteed."
bad,"At the Jackson, TN facility:  High turnover rate is high due to employees not being respected. Tight on pay and will cut you off at the knees and take from you when can depending on what benefits the company. Set up for failure not success. If a company ever needed a union it would be this one."
bad,When they offered a the position they promised 8 hrs a day 5 days a week. We work 6 to 7 days a week 10 + hours a day. There was no life work balance and no plan in place to give you that work life balance.
bad,Its an OK place if you like being stuck in the same position for your entire career. Also if you don't like getting raises or chances to earn more money this is the place to go.
bad,"Not a job that requires much intelligence but the management certainly made it difficult to be successful. The turnover was well above average and morale below average but was never addressed satisfactorily. The blame was always put on the lowest and often newest employees when management was the only constant in that place. They wasted man hours on overtime but refused to give merit increases to the employees who mastered their position. Like I said, not rocket science, would have been a tolerable situation if they had somebody up top with some common sense."
bad,not bad for a logistic company but they can improve better and give more benefit to employees and better pay too and hr dont give a dam about any opinion
bad,"If you agree to work over, even once, you will spend all your time chained to your desk. Truck pre and post trips, no lunch breaks, 10+ hour shifts, multiple phone lines, no help, criticism is free, praise is rare."
bad,"A trucking company with experienced but incompetent management with incoherent communication skills and scape goat mentality (to protect personnel who have been with company for long term and make fall guys of new recruits)."
bad,"management tries to force people into things with equipment that is not safe (bald tires, bad fifth wheels), Management also changes peoples schedules without notification."
bad,"If your ok with being jerked around, lied to, pay check stolen from and having your career turned into a joke...go for it. The Service manager and Shop supervisor, from the Harrisburg Pa branch, are the most deceitful incompetent managers I've come across in 20+ years in the industry. They act more like a catty Corporate high school glam squad then leaders in the Trucking industry. The Tech 4's, who have 8 years shop experience between the two of them, rely on ""captain of the ship"" when they don't want to do something and dump the real technical jobs on the tech 2's and 3's. Overall shop was more like a fractured sports team with teams within a team expending more time and energy playing ankle biting, back stabbing, childish clown games with each other then working together for the same goal. If you talk a lot of bull$#!& are self promoting, prone to snitching, when ever a opportunity arises, and shirk away from physically demanding tasks you'll fit in well at the Harrisburg branch. I feel Ryder has a good set of principals...It's sad to see how far one branch can stray away from them."
bad,"Ryder did not provide the necessary training for an individual to successfully manage an off site contract, which had taken over the transportation of product from union employees."
bad,Overall the London hub is poorly managed. The company takes and gives little in return. The claim a great work life balance but only if that suits their needs.
bad,"racist non caring individuals in management as well as shop floor personel , lied to all the time about overtime and holidays off"
bad,Way too much work and stress for way too little pay. High turnover rate is indicative of poor management. Benefits are mediocre.
bad,"A typical day was fairly easy.  Equipment was fairly well maintained.   The people there were ok.  From Oct to Jan you had to work 6-7 days a week 10-12hr a day. Christmas eve isn't a holiday and they love to hold making you work Christmas over your head so no one calls off,(had to work Christmas 2011 then they had layoffs right after New years!)."
bad,"I worked there for about 10 years.Because one small negligence I got fired.People are jelous if you do, a good job. They just watch how it will harm you in front of manager. This company is full of back stabbing,rats! Manager did not know how to treat people.Management is horibble and always looking for reason  to make work harder and how they can bully you around. If you,re ready to flatter want to follow every mowement of the camera this is the place for you if you do not run away as far away from this company."
bad,"This company does not seem to understand that employees are its best asset. Everything happens behind closed doors and there is no communication. While the company is doing well, they are not sharing it with their employees, with the exception of top level executives who get stock options and fat bonuses. There are no raises, so there is no incentive to perform well."
bad,"Busy everyday."
bad,"You have to tarp and untarp your load anywhere between 5 and 15 times a day,depending on the amount of stops you have.Management doesn't know how to route your load out correctly.Management has its favorite drivers.The hardest part of the job is taking orders from someone who knows less then you do.The best part of the day is driving home from the job."
bad,"Job depends on your manager"
bad,"First of all I will say that people here are super nice and work great as a team.  Our supervisor is amazing, always willing to help and always has a positive attitude and gives encouragement.  But, the processes they've set up to do the work are very backwards and time consuming as if there is no thought into designing the workflow.  Half the time the machines freeze up or the databases crash.  They are still using Micro-soft ACCESS for one of their DB, a product that hasn't been supported for 12 years now!  It crashes constantly and hurts your workflow.  The call volume we get is ENORMOUS and it feels like this place is severely understaffed!  Honestly, it's like they only have about 1/2 of the people they need to staff this place  I've had seven years call center experience before this job, supporting very high end financial services I.T. just to let you know where I'm coming from.  "
bad,"I was told weekends off and that was a lie. And also $1200 to $ 1400 a week bring home. Also a lie ,I mean atleast for new guys.if your a senior  driver you have it made because the management  catered  to those guys  easy run high paying routes and made sure they got back at a descent  time on fridays to get there full weekends  .They will paint a really good picture  for you in  trainingturns  into a whole other pictuand world when your on your own not worth the stress and bull you go thru pallet  drops all turn into  piece drops cause warehouse  sucks and management  do not back drivers on that behalf so dr iui version work harder than needed  with no comp"
bad,Local route gets you home daily.  A lot of favoritism with management and many drivers...The location I work for isn’t as open minded toward diversity as I have experienced in other locations.
bad,"Company needs to work on work life balance, when I was there I easy work 50 plus hours a week. Paycheck was great. In the organization everyone talks trash about anyone and everyone one, no respect for one another in the organization. If you choose to work here get ready for long hours and no respect at the work place as well as several managers along your journey."
bad,Company policies were more conducive to robots than people. Maintenance Issues put off for long periods. Poor operations management. Sometimes had to wait an hour or two for a Truck after arriving for scheduled run.
bad,It seems to me that they dislike you if you’ve been there long. Watch your back because they will find slick ways to boot you out the door. Management needs work.
bad,"It was a good job and I enjoyed my co workers and the position.  Very small working conditions, seven in one very small office - most enjoyable was paycheck."
bad,Idk how to explain that management was horribly negative and absolutely no help in moving forward in the company for fixing problems. Totally wish I would asked more questions at the interview.
bad,They over work you. If you have a family you will need to take a picture of them because that will be the only time you will see them.  For the pay it isn't worth it.  The job was easy just backing trailers into the assigned doors. I just wish they cared about the men and women that work all them hours.
bad,"manager will lie to your face,girl that does the loads,doesnt know how to do her job,she favortism other driver/benefits are not the greatest/equipment not the greatest/filthy trucks on inside"
bad,I requested to go from yard work to over the road with a local position I knew was open and was told I couldn't transfer jobs because they were too short in the yard. Management frequently overlooked direct OSHA violations committed by drivers for the location (paper processing plant and letting drivers smoke in the trucks on the grounds is a fire hazard). Frequent complaints to safety and health and safety offices from the client location were useless.
bad,"I worked an average of 12 hours a day and still took work home with me. Very poor training from upper management and they will hang you out to dry, A good majority of the skills I needed to learn where self taught. After everything I had accomplished and did exactly what upper management instructed me to do. I was still let got. (Last day worked was 0100 to 17:30) Compensation was excellent that is really why I did not complain about the hours. Other locations our probably better. So don't do some research before taking the position."
bad,"No matter how hard you try or how many hours you put in daily, upper management will never acknowledge you effort or initiative, they seem to always be looking for any reason to degrade you and point out you flaws.  It was a very sad place to work."
bad,"It was an ok job until the new system took over. They expect you to hit 100% production rate while the system is complete garbage. Supervisors stress over this system too and just pass on the stress to the workers. Shifts are supposed to be 4 day work weeks and now they're working up to 7 days in a week mandatory! This company does not care about you or your personal life, so you better show up to work."
bad,At first it was enjoyable but after 2 months. I was fed up. Management isn’t flexible and won’t reason with you. If you bring a doctors note it’s voided so don’t expect to go to the doctors during work hours. On your feet all day. A Shift supervisor is an utter pain. Operations manager is a pain to deal with.
bad,"A typical day is very quite they don’t micro manage so your really by your self all day. I learned how to operate all equipment at the job Reach lift truck, pallet jack, docker, etc. As far as pros and cons go.. Pros I like driving the reach lift I’m good at it. I also like the job it self. "
bad,"I wouldn't recommend RYDER to anyone , no communication within upper management.  Pay is good but the job is very stressful . There is no team work , everyone is for themselves"
bad,Typical workday lately is going in and making sure all my tasks are complete and not to make waves.  Some supervisors are great to work for while others are a little more hard to please.
bad,"There is a culture at Ryder that makes sure slow and dangerous drivers receive the same pay as the efficient and safe drivers. People that ride the clock and steal hours are not punished, but rather rewarded by getting big paychecks. I ignored all the favoritism and kept minding my own business. I was able to clear mid 60's and be home every night. That being said I worked 70 hour weeks for 2 years straight. This is important to know also....If you get hurt on the job they are self insured work comp. This is not a benefit to the injured party."
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful. Not because there are dissatisfied customers who have put their trust and money into Ryder's Used Vehicles, but because they are broken down on some road and being told they cannot be helped."
bad,"Poor health insurance.  Too many bosses with no answers.  Very bad communication.  No relaying of messages. No system of work delegation.  Continuous phone calls for help on days and shifts that you didn't sign up for, when turned down,  next dispatcher calling you.  Lol"
bad,"Manager bullied drivers, came in to work with alcohol on his breath on a regular basis . Expectations from management were I consistent with driver safety. Management has no driving experience and limited knowledge of how driver retention works.  I have seen multiple complains and investigations on manager with no improvement. Perhaps the company as a whole is good but there is non existent checks and balances as far as improving the employee experience."
bad,"The only thing I actually enjoyed about Ryder was the pay. We work in a GM owned plant, so any issues that occur, you will hear ""GM is the customer."" The management is a good ole boys club. And you will constantly be overworked and under appreciated."
bad,"I joined a new account which also had hired a new manager to Ryder. She lacked any good communication skill, never provided the tools promised to do the job and poorly dispatched not based on hours available. After a month of not receiving a workable toll transponder, no fuel card, and a truck with electrical issues not addressed. I left because I was being dispatched against my hours of service regulations because Ryder was never able to hire enough drivers."
bad,If your an older worker do not apply.  Ryder doesn't not care about there season workforce only replacing them instead of retraining and promoting from within
bad,"I worked as a Hostler for nearly two years, never saw a raise or had so much as an atta boy.  Management has a no - care attitude and is unresponsive."
bad,Rotated between 12hrs day followed 12hr night. Start at either 04:00 or 16:00.  Was always twelve hours on.  Was a strange scheduling system used; would end up with a four (4) day in row off per month.
bad,"Hired for a trainee program on day shift , but there was no formal training program. Some co-workers we’re willing to help but they were under pressure to keep up with their normal chaotic work schedule so there wasn’t much time for training. Work life balance is horrible. After working for a month I was put on evening shift with no warning and no estimated end date. Truly bait & switch, they hire you first then change your hours, job duties or whatever and expect you to deal with because you need a job."
bad,Great hourly employees working for this company.  Very dedicated with low benefits/advancements offered.  Little to no regard for work/life balance. Hired as Packaging Manager and eventually had to do Supervisor role also as job openings were not filled.  In at 5am 6 days/week and helping to manage 2 facilities during peak season.
bad,"worked for this company over a year and was treated good till manager retired . the job we were contracted for would make mistakes communicating to the drivers and customers, and would do everything in there power to pass on the blame to drivers so they wouldnt get the blame. new management thought drivers were causing the problems, but figured out later after all of the longest drivers quit that it was actually the people at the contractors location creating problems. other than the frustrating parts from bad communication, it was a awesome place to work for"
bad,The management at this place is bad if you disagree with them they will fire you. I have work at 5 different ryder plants and this management is the worst. The HR lady does not help you and will find way to get rid of you.
bad,"I would not recommend working for this employer at the warehouse facilities. Pay was good, but the warehouse had really horrible management and didn't have a care about the employee."
bad,"around the holidays you can really make some good money, its a multi cultural warehouse most of the people are friendly. The warehouse is pretty clean there is not a lot of dust and dirt like some places. Don't know how the management is now but when I worked there they had a management problem."
bad,"The good side of the company is they give you a job to do and let you do it. the horrible side is they try to take your money. Stealing your hours, forgetting your overtime pay and even stat pay. You will constantly feel like your getting robbed by your own employer. They are trying to hire as many foreign drivers who they believe wont complain about getting stolen from."
bad,"management doesn't value the drivers, "
bad,"If can, they want you to work 7 days straight."
bad,"For a supervisor, it can be very stressful place to work. Chaos is the way Ryder\Bay Valley wants it.In order to make throughput, you cannot finish anything or get ahead in any way."
bad,Learnt the overall operations in a warehouse facility. Enjoyed learning and interacting with new people. The least desirable part of working for this company was the lack of security for the staff.
bad,"Great for college students or people just looking for work, if you want to move up and be something, look else where. I worked at the ATT yard and didnt get any of the ATT benefits, even though I was doing the same thing and working the same hours as my ATT counterpart."
bad,"When I first started, the work was simple and everybody had a different positions making it easy for everyone to move around and gain experience with different machines and equipment. I moved up 2 different positions, from assembling products to the shipping and receiving positions. For me, the auditing position was the most enjoyable. There were some difficult tasks for customer standards for some freight. After a couple months, a few things had to change, which lost my job as an auditor and went back to assembling. For that, their job security was not very well. I and 2 other co-workers got demoted just because they wanted a certain number of auditors on the floor. After that, I worked for a couple days then realized they were not that reliable to myself and other employees I know. Overall, I enjoyed learning and experiencing a typical day in a distribution warehouse; handling RF guns, knowing how to check for freight physically and systematically, certain ways to correctly wrap pallets, and every concept in logistics. When it comes to Kimco Staffing, I don't trust the way they schedule their employees for short, temporary hours."
bad,"unload and load trailers, put product away. organizing loads, management had something to be desired. Coworkers were great to work with. Hardest part of the day was dealing with managements indecions on a constent day"
bad,Training is not good at all. This company has a history of racial activity. I had asked for training several times and the company has failed to provide proper training to be effective. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"co workers were hard to work with, job training was very poor, lack of communication, I learned how to prepare bills for trucking companies"
bad,"Company does not recognize desires to progress. I was denied the opportunity for additional training for job expectations that were not to management standards. After receiving satisfactory scores on appraisals, I would still receive reports of missed marks for task.  The branch I worked for did not offer assistants for minorities."
bad,"Operating stand-up lift, Dockstocker, Sit down propane"
bad,"Management had a lack of follow through, cut corners, and didn't let employees make nesseccary repairs as is it was exspensive."
bad,"Great Start then downhill from there. Job task made much more difficult than it should be due to inept management. Ryder is simply a delivery service provider for CVS whom having it's own problems loads trailers inefficiently and Dangerously. Then CVS creates the routing causing nothing but insults to and already bad situation. The job itself is rather easy and not bad from a drivers standpoint however no help is offered nor solutions rendered to make things better. Don't expect more than the 10 hrs. min off and Forget about the New FMCA 1/2 break, plan on working thru that too! With proper management Replacements having more than dispatching and dock working experience this would possibly be the Best working driver position in the North East. Plan on working though as you unload all by hand and yes, holidays ( including Christmas ) as CVS is Open 365."
bad,"typical day would include a PM or federal inspection, brakes, electrical, transmission, driveline work. most enjoyable part of my job was working on trucks, hardest part was the hour and 20 min commute. did not have co workers on second shift i worked alone."
bad,"Long hours for average pay, no advancement, unsafe conditions, DOT rule violations, no cares about employee's."
bad,Taking messages from drivers.
bad,Contradictory expectations. Though face friendly. Helpful coworkers.
bad,"Georgetown,Ky Has some of the worst management, Every week signing your name to some new rule they come up with that usually does nothing to rectify the situation. "
bad,The pay and benefits with Ryder are sub par when compared to the rest of the industry. Driver retention is below standard. The only benefits are being home every night but there are plenty of other companies that offer that as well.
bad,"poor management, if your a ""yes man"" that's what they want to hear. no room for advancement and want you to work overtime daily without any prior notice."
bad,Will never pay correctly promise to pay for mileage but never did. Overload  workers knowing they have to be up early the next day to do the same thing the next day. Do not pay well
bad,"If you like weak managers, lazy co-workers, and those that are not bosses attempting to be your boss, then this is the place for you. If not keep looking."
bad,Nothing special about this shop it is  going down the drain  they value numbers more than quality treat African born and white employees better then American blacks won't replace any in shop everything is ethier broken or missing.
bad,"If you know video games and cartoons then your skills are needed to push buttons all day. If you can't solve a trucking industry problem, this is the place to work because you will not have to here AND ITS A TRUCKING COMPANY!!!. "
bad,"Beware when working here. Once you rub them the wrong way once, they’re looking for a way to get you out. BEWARE. In addition, there will be no work life balance. You will only work and feel unappreciated for it."
bad,great place to start to be a mechanic horrible to work at and finish your career they play favs and games and wont let you move in the company unless you know someone and then they kick to third and keep you there
bad,I absolutely did not like my experience at the Ryder Corporation. Faulty equipment and machines some of the problems we encountered on daily basis which made our jobs impossible to complete in a timely fashion.
bad,"Many promises, few delivered"
bad,I was lied to by the recruiter regarding pay! Benefits package is good. Shop has no parts in stock and have to go to a dealer. Management does not care about advancement
bad,Working in an excessive heat environment with no fans and They don't think we need any    Humidity is so high the doors have to be filed all the time for their swell shut  Want way more than the orders will let you do   Would not recommend it to anybody
bad,"Ambivalent and aloof towards lower position employees. Old boys network type upper management. Overworked, unsupportive middle management. Toxic work culture by and by."
bad,"Upper management is improving, but there is an alarming amount of outdated policies and ways to prevent you from doing your job effectively. The hours are hard - they will often make you work 50 hour work weeks, because they are poor at hiring. "
bad,Very fast pace and always something to do.  Never a slow moment.  They have way to many conference calls and not enough time on shop floor for manager
bad,Its good to work at ryder but management is no good there is good people that work here but if you do good in a job management dont see that but if you do bad you will hear about that the next day.
bad,Discrimination in its staff  . They have temps working dispatch and most of them dont know much in the industry .......................................
bad,"I loved to work at ryder, but the management is ridiculous. management is a joke, they don't know how to run a business, they lost the contract with Philips and everything got worst, they never had the material we needed to get our work done. and would get mad at us for not having the orders completed"
bad,"My job was based at GM; I never actually did work for Ryder.  But, having them as my HR company really sucked.  Very little employee support, poor communication and cheap."
bad,"Ryder is a shell of its former self.  The trucks are outdated and unreliable due to long lease terms.  The upper management is disorganized at best and that trickles directly down into the shop level.  Not a terrible place to work as a tech or a driver, but forget anything above that.  The starting pay is good and the benefits are excellent but not worth it.  As an hourly employee they attempt to own you,  they will flip flop your hours all over the place, you sign on for a first shift position and next you know your third shift.  As a salary employee, they literally do own you.  Expect sleepless nights, many missed family events, 15 or more hour days, the laptop they give you is a leash, and you will never actually vacation again.  This doesn't even include what I put up with from a service manager who couldn't manage a paper bag."
bad,Hauling train fuel. Do not have a fuel spill. managed quite well. culture was to try to make it easy for your relief. getting up at4 in the morning. good co workers.
bad,They let me go and i worked hard for them and they just let me go. That makes me feel like they dont want a hard work. Yes . I have made some poor choices in my life just as well as alot of other people but thats one reason to say that someone like myself that go out there way for your business to have them just kick you out and not thonk about people family. So to end this. I will and can't work for a place like that.
bad,"Wanna work somewhere you can advance and grow?! Look elsewhere. RLM Has little to no room for advancement and even when an opportunity crops up, your manager will probably just hire an old buddy of his from some place he worked before."
bad,"Ryder was a nice place to work, but warehouse closed after 14 months of operations.  There was no place for advancement for me within the company and I had an Associates Degree and my supervisor did not have any degree-not sure that was fair."
bad,"Culture is often miss communicated, Complete mess in regards to communication, Operations Manager is unethical in his dealing with employees, drivers, Customers. Operations Manager violates the Buisness code of conduct on a daily  basis and is self bias. The only good thing about Rochelle, Il is the Site Manager whom is fair in all his doings"
bad,"The Operations Manager at Ryder Rochelle, Il repeatedly violates the business code of conduct. He also is extremely unethical in his treatment of employee's as well as with drivers and his Customer's. The only Jewel in this mess is the Site Manager who is fair in all his doings. One has to get to the Site Manager to get anything straitened out. There are good floor Supervisor's at this facility however, They leave often do to the mistreatment they are given by The Operations Manager. I do not recommend anyone ever working at this site. The Communication alone at this place is enough to drive any employ nuts. The Human resources department is terrible as well."
bad,I was working there long hours everyday no complains doing my job the best I can fallowing all safety guidelines Was never late  Always offered  To stay and help Then one day an african on a fork truck  Ran all stop signs in the warehouse and almost ran me over  They fired me for yelling at the guy for almost killing me
bad,you start on first shift but then they bid your position and you could go to 2nd shift at different location working a Thursday through Tuesday shift night's
bad,"I would not recommend a friend to work there,unless it was a life or death situation. They would not give us any benefits whatsoever. The management were really not doing their jobs."
bad,nothing good to say really about the company poor management etc etc.... Overall great company that I enjoyed working for. Benefits. Each Ryder location is different.
bad,Management had poor people skills. Human resources cared very little for the employees. Employee was mandated over 12 hours shift and six days a week.
bad,"company too fast pasted"
bad,Payroll for multi states on an account became long and drawn out.  Came in when it was dark and left when it was dark..Managers and drivers not held accountable for getting their payroll in timely.  Payroll manager on this account was also the driver manager for this location.  He is a very unpleasant manager who made working here  the epitomy of a hostile working environment.  The best part of the job was the drivers!  They were AWESOME!
bad,"as a technician, it is the same job as any truck leasing company, as a manager it was not that good. Due to the fact that the company is publicly traded it seemed as though corporate cared more about the stock holders than its customers."
bad,The work environment is not up to par to what I am used to. I didn't get adequate training as I came in during a busy time. I still have not received adequate training I have been going with the flow.
bad,Work for Ryder and you may not get paid on time. OK if your in bad need of a job. Your work hours and off days can be changed at a days notice. It took 2 months for them to get my pay right and set up my direct deposit.
bad,"I'm going to be honest I don't have any kind words for Ryder, they treat you like a labor monkey and beat you to death with unimaginative it's kind of pathetic"
bad,Stressful because no career advancement but still working hard and doing everything and more to help benefit the company. The learning is present for any and everyone but not able to be accessed because of management.
bad,"Good work place but no for long term, the job is easy but working to much overtime and it’s mandatory, never pay raises, it’s low pay compared with other companies."
bad,Its all about who you know here at Ryder. The system is messed up. The company discriminates against people of other cultures and races especially on the west coast.
bad,most of the management were never on the same terms as its staff and there was always a lack of respects for those who weren't able to get the job as fast as others.
bad,The Ryder in Lockbourne is a terrible place to work for. The culture is every man for themselves and no one understands how to do their job. The management is a joke and they don't know how to do anything correctly so they just point blame at everyone else. DON'T WORK HERE.
bad,"management was horrible and were evntually removed from the contract and facility customer. everyone, whether on the floor or mid management worked alot of over time."
bad,Every morning people would never be ready to work. Sometimes there would never be work for us to do. Then the machines you would have to try to start them up and get them organized.
bad,"This place has no structure they are very unorganized . They work the employees to the max doing 12/14 hours or even 16. "
bad,"High school clique culture"
bad,"A poorly ran facility with very low wages which aren't compeditive within the field. Little to no opportunity for advancement as well as poor supervision and management. Also racism and discrimination amongst minorities and the All white upper management staff. Benefits are costly and often don't benefit the employee at all. Poor planning leading to poor execution. Work is late at times and often inaccurate due to failure to understand the tasks and the field of work itself from supervision and management.  Employees are often targeted, singled out, and lied to. Most jobs are better than no job. A job at ryder is slightly better than being unemployed. However, the almost non existent annual raises are almost like having no job at all. Also, very little overtime is offered and no double time ever. They have paid vacations but also have slow periods which force employees to use vacation time in order to attain 40 hours in a week."
bad,didn't realy like this location they was not friendly and I just started school I worked 3 rd shift and they didn't agree to help me with hours. I work here with temp agency
bad,Good place to work if you need a job but for management the hours are long and there if no benefits to working the long hours.  You are just asked to do more.  Management is terrible but in other facilities its fairly good
bad,"They are a fortune 500 company from riding on the backs of their employees..  I worked for Ryder for 3 years, as a manager and was also thrown in the trash when I needed them the most.  While in need for surgery, this company administratively terminated me for exceeding short term disability.  The day long term went effective, I had a letter of termination.  Long term disability doesn't kick in for 6 months, for 40%.  They eat you up and spit you out..  oh yeah, the injury occurred while visiting a customer for Ryder to collect money, to boot..  "
bad,OK place to work. Really nothing more to say about the company.  It's not a place for myself to work anymore.  Poor management and communications skills
bad,Company is good but there is so many different variables when it comes the the business plan. Management is random as well with their style and at times it felt they cared about the trucks more then the enmployees.
bad,"If the supervisor was not one who stayed in the middle of the younger generation life style maybe she would have been more fare around the board with everyone. However, I worked hard and was always working overtime to balance what the others were not doing."
bad,Ryder as a whole is a decent company to work for. I have worked for them over 6 years. There is room to move up but one needs to put in the time to get to this point.
bad,"don't work here...not a good place to work.unsafe forklift drivers. they act like a bunch of young cowboys on the forklifts. tons of last minute overtime,upper level management is brainless,clueless, un-wise, and heartless. problems with paychecks....promotions....they really don't know what they are doing in Alburtis. there is also a gang element at this facility.young men flashing gang signs,speaking in strange tongues,and hoodlum like tattoos.most of the employees are shallow,narcissitic,self-centered, people...flippin burgers...digging graves and workin at dorney park is much better than this place. no secret santa.... no company picnics.no hams or turkeys during the holidays.my advice,.....DONT WORK HERE!!!."
bad,"It was a okay place for work. The pay rate was $8.50 Ryder good working environment, didn't really like most the job we had to do but I still did it cause its money coming in."
bad,Ryder as a whole is not a terrible place to work. However it is not a very professional company to work for. The people lack degrees and the management are low class. I literally had to train my manager to become my manager. The man was a complete idiot.
bad,Management did not offer positive feedback.  Strict deadline/quota to meet.  Worked 2nd shift with only a few employees. (20 or less).
bad,"not a good group of folks to work for if you have a family, very little personal touch on this job, all business ,full of numbers use you upp and get another ."
bad,"A lot of work with little rewards for hourly employees."
bad,"Ryder Truck Rental is the best known entity of Ryder Systems, Inc.  Most of those locations are maintenance locations that have been in existence for years that employ truck technicians and sales clerks.  If you were to apply to one, you are more than likely into repairing tractor-trailers."
bad,"Very inexperienced management staff. Overall lack of knowledge both legally and industry, as well as their policies and prcedures. Virtually no knowledge of their own safety programs and procedures. Upper management is absolutely out of touch with employee base and not available."
bad,"Typical Day at work 6-6PM from Mon to Sat."
bad,"good company to work for, however the job it self is stressful and dissatisfying"
bad,"A typical day at Ryder is starting the day very early, but getting off in time to be able to pick my son up from school. I would walk the yard and inspect all vehicle's, to make sure they were ready to be leased after use. I would make the schedule for the mechanic's for the day both morning and evening shift, answering phones, filing, customer service, constant multi-phone, billing, contacting existing or potential clients for service and most importantly, being able to shift from one task to another and back very quickly."
bad,a lot of off the clock work management was pregidous and did not run company the way logistics hired him too and employees allowed it
bad,"Picking orders for customers somedays and others I am loading or unloading trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with. The hard part of the job was when i had orders with too many chemicals on them, some of the chemicals weighing anywhere from 50 to 70 lbs and pulling 48 cases on the order."
bad,Have Favorites and very strick on attendance.will smile in your face and talk behind your. Back they dont care about nothing about your well being.They poor communication and a high turn over rate
bad,"Worked overnights on WI, office was moved to the middle of a million foot paper storage warehouse surrounded by 72 trailer doors. "
bad,"I had a good job ,perfect attendance, was a dam good worker. Then got a woman manager who I know didn't like me . And just short of my 10 yrs with ryder she pulled a fast one on me , didn't follow there own rules in there very thick employee handbook witch isn't worth the paper it's written on .And I filed a complaint against her for not following there own rules . And of corse they sided with her. So they replaced me with another person at less pay .So they really don't care about loualty to the company just the bottom dollar. I was looking forward to my 10 yrs with the company cause they gave the drivers a million mile safe driver award and a ring. And they cheated me out of that."
bad,No help what so ever they lie to you about everything no one knows what is going on they have no clue on how to run a warehouse they tell you one thing and expect you to do something else.
bad,Management caters to the young girls.  Lots of favoritism.  They expected way too much out of their employees quota wise.  Best time of day was 3 pm when you went home
bad,Work hard at peek times. Dont expect high pay for rental positions. The culture there was very toxic. Rentals and sales departments and service  always had to much tension.
bad,No flexibility with changing shifts. Ok place to work for a warehouse. Pay rate got better towards end of my employment but it could have been better for a 12 hour shift and considering how far it is.
bad,My manager at first was phenomenal and we worked as an amazing team. After my supervisor moved to a different location they hired a manager that was not trainable AT ALL. I as the dispatcher had to train my own supervisor who would not sit still or take a note to help himself out and after 6 months still did not know my job and I was still doing his job. He was very confrontational BUT the customer liked him so Ryder always took his word over mine. I was constantly yelled at for doing my job wrong but was doing it right but he never made the time to look at his emails and was always leaving the office to go eat with his wife at her job. He did not do well with stress at all. He was in the Marines 25 years ago and always talked about it yet he doesn’t even know how to strap a flatbed truck and I was always doing his RyderDrive apps to the phones of the drivers as he didn’t have the patience to learn the system that he should have learned. He is a horrible boss and it takes an amazing management team to make a great work environment.
bad,"All the things that made up for the fact that they do not pay OT are gone. "
bad,Could be better.  Senior Manager is only a manager in title.  No support for employees or job related issues.  Poor customer and vendor management.  Very unfortunate as I was excited to work for the company.
bad,"Not professional, low pay for work done.New equipment sucks..brand new equipment and they go cheap..breaking down already.Someone is making money,but it's not the drivers.401 k is good..benefits are expensive...over all corporate sucks..Ryder is going downhill..its all about shareholders not the employees..oh and the new Ryder drive is joke..they swear it's the best.."
bad,There has been a lot of changes in the last 6 Months. So many different managers. It is a great place to work if expect 0 problems in your outside life.
bad,"If you want a low paying, stressful, dead end job, this is the place for you. The only good thing I can say is that they are serious about employee safety. So, if you want a safe, low paying, stressful, dead end job, this is the place for you."
bad,This company has a large turnover rate due to bad management and bad morale in the management team and employees. There was a lot of theft going on in the warehouse and illegal activities in a back office.  I would never recommend someone to work here.
bad,"The leads are great however the people over them are terrible. The way they promote, hid stuff for each other, and just their general attitudes. Great coworkers."
bad,"They always under contract and every launch is a nightmare. This causes no work life balance and it's not a good place to work if you have a family. Some accounts are better than most, however it seems as though all management is uninvolved until something goes wrong. The management does not care to help it's team."
bad,"I enjoyed working there, logistics business provides daily challenges which keeps you engaged. It was my first exposure to the business and look forward to another opportunity to work in the field again."
bad,"worst place to work for worker's joke around to much,hardly no work to do very slow work pace.management sucks no leadership or room to grow.the hardest part of the job is staying awake and the most enjoyable part of the job is leaving to go home."
bad,Typical day was come in and wait at least 20 minutes for a forklift and when you did get it you had to go charge it and that put you behind for the rest of the night.
bad,"Ryder is a very successful company, but they are like Amazon in that there is not a good work life balance which I firmly believe in.  Ryder is also a very segmented company, meaning that internal business units are very isolated from each other.  If you like an environment like this, then you will excel at a company such as Ryder.  Otherwise, stay as far away as possible."
bad,This was not a good place to work. Worked locally putting in 14 hour days and only bringing home about 900 dollars or less per week. Do yourself a favor and find a better place to work like McDonald's.
bad,"The HR department at Ryder is Great, they help in every way if you have questions or needs. The supervisors on C shift are also good, questions get answered and they care about the people. But the supervisor on D shift shows a big lack of leadership skills. More worried about sitting in the office playing on her phone then anything else. The work was good and also the pay. There is a lot of gossip but that is everywhere. If you can work in the cold, this is a good company to work for."
bad,"Ryder isnt a bad place to work. It is a little slow paced and they pay is definitely low. You get 8 hours a day which is good. I learn how to pack, pick from paper, and ship. Management is pretty cool and understanding. the hardest part of the job is packing. determining what boxes the product goes in and how will it be shipped. the most enjoyable park of the job is we off saturday and sunday. the worst thing is the schedule 830 to 530 to 6. destroys your day you cant get much done with this schedule unless your late or take a day off."
bad,"Job is ok, just the work hours are difficult once your on the job.  Job is busy and you don't have time to catch your breath. You get a half hour for lunch and 2 fifteen minute breaks"
bad,"I worked there as a tech for many years.Was one of the better mechanic jobs in town at one time .Being on call after hours,low pay, supervisors that have been promoted beyond their capability and silly counter productive corporate rules.This is the down side.Better jobs are out there,keep looking"
bad,"A typical day at Ryder was to make sure your parts was correct, then get on the tugger get to the assembly line fast and safe as you can to make sure the assembly line didn't go down to load the line every eleven minutes. Working rotating shifts every week was difficult."
bad,"I WORKED At Ryder less than 2 weeks. They tried to force me to pull a hamat load of corrosives weighing in at over 9000 lbs from CT to MD. I refused that of course then I was late by one hour and they fired me. They hire mostly temps. Only a 3 year contract. "
bad,A typical day at work consist of managing multiple accounts. Ensuring freight payment in a timely manner. Management were goals driven and supportive.  Co-workers were hard working and helpful. The hardest part of the job was limited advancement opportunities.
bad,"Long days.Learned what it take to build engines.Management good,coworkers good.Hardest part of job is the hours.Working from 4:30pm to 3:00am Best part of day when I take off steeltoe boots."
bad,"I worked for Ryder for 3 months and was one of their best employees (their words) but when a coworker of mine and myself got into an argument, she called management and told them I stole something from her purse.  Instead of approaching me about it and getting my side, they assumed that I did what I was accused of, and fired me.  I called and spoke to everyone I could and they just said they couldn't do anything about it."
bad,Management was horrible and not organized. The was no accountability anywhere. They want things done now and don't take time to do them right the firs time.
bad,"There is no ""typical day at work"". This is a good thing, as I am always learning new things and being exposed to new aspects of the business."
bad,second checking all completed orders by the order pickers assuring there are no damaged product I am certified to operate forklift machinery I also wrap skids and stage them in correct shipping lanes I also prepare all paper work and pro the loads and get them ready for the loaders in the shipping department.
bad,"I worked for Ryder for over one year.  I resigned due to work life balance.  I also wanted to continue my education in receiving an MBA in Human Resources.  I had operated managed a 24/7 shop and rental/leasing office.  The following skills I have learned while working at Ryder are:"
bad,"Very little training, poor management, poor retention rate."
bad,"Very old school company, very little innovation, very old workforce. Would not recommend anyone under the age of 40 to work here"
bad,"I was a Packer, Line lead , material handler , and a order picker ."
bad,"I worked on night shift it started at 3 pm and normally ended at 11:30 pm. As soon as I got there usually work that day shift did not want to do was left for night shift. I learned an incredible amount there because anything that was some what complicated or if a drive up came in the boss would come to me with answers after only a few months of being there and remember this was my first diesel mechanic job there was a lot I did not know at the time but Ryder does not have a dead line so if one comes in and it has a major issue get ready to dive into it bc  ryder does not keep alot of rentals for sub units especially at the shop I was at I mean we had about 450 units but mostly full service leases and level one which means ryder does not own the truck someone just pays us to fix it and level ones that they want you to fix usually have about 750,000 miles on them lol. So need less to say I learned more than my little mind could handle we had 12 diesel mechanics and 3 fuel/ truck washers but I would also fuel when no one was there or when they were at lunch. I learned how to replace  AC systems,transmissions, wheel seals and bearings, drive lines, turbo's, EGR valves and coolers, water pumps, radiators, oil and transmission coolers, fuel injectors, truck seats, power window motors, door locks, ignitions, 5th wheels, coolant reservoirs, and any wiring on a truck that you can imagine I had my hands on it. I learned all that with ryder and much more there is just to much to list about what I learned and I was a T2 making 14.25 hr to start and 2 and a half years later I was making"
bad,ive learned alot from this company management always rushed and never was concerned about the employees 
bad,"Labor intensive accounts.You will earn every dollar you make.Management has a ""what have you done for me lately""attitude.Stay on managements good side and you will work,if not start looking for another job.Pay is decent a little better then average but is off set by high premiums on medical and dental.All Ryder driving jobs are contract jobs with third party customers,that means when the contracts up you will be looking for a job."
bad,Its best to work there and judge for yourself. What I am looking for may be different from the next person. I am greatful for the opportunity and learned alot
bad,"I have worked for them almost 5 yrs total. When I started I was told that raises come every year and you never have to worry about losing your job. Well, that was all lies. I have never received a raise nor has any of my coworkers as the managers say there is a freeze on raises. I cant afford the health insurance. I am constantly worried about losing my job because they will not attempt to try to save you by placing you somewhere else if your job ""goes away"" and mine will soon. I am micromanaged to the point I feel like a kinder-gardener. I cant have a conversation on the phone without the manager budding in and attempting to handle my call."
bad,"The company I worked for was acquired by Ryder, Inc. in 2018.  We were told that we would be allowed to operate as usual without corporate interference.  That lasted just over a year, and then the organization began to experience restructuring.  Ryder does not care about its tenured employees and the value they provide to the organization as a whole."
bad,"Tried to honestly review this company and some of the pitfalls that a new driver may face."
bad,60 hrs a week mandatory was way to much to balance but the income was good and they did help with most issues that came up and the 10 hr shifts seemed good but at 60 hrs a week was hard to balance
bad,"It's an ok job to work at if you never had experience in working in a factory.An assembly line is constantly going, if your not on the assembly line you are making the boxes for the chips to go in. The management plays a huge favoritism role. You will not come to work everyday thinking you will be on a line, if the lines are full they'll ask if you want to go home and if not they'll have you do janitorial work."
bad,"Money is good for being home everyday, good amount of miles daily, some office staff were excellent people and others were awful. You never knew what time you were going to work or when they would even have a truck you could use. I was told to drive a truck with a known shifting fault code because the manager was having a bad and busy day."
bad,In six months I didnt have one day where I felt like I could breath. They piled more and more and more onto your role until you want to puke. It was just expected that you take on new tasks without question. Most stressful job I have ever had in my life.
bad,Room for advancement has too many strings attached. Upper management has no compassion. They don’t listen to the operations team. No open door policy. You have jump threw hoops to be heard.
bad,"Dont bother working here. My first week there 2 drivers quit that should of been a red flag right there Everything they say is a lie and they're full of broken promises. When I saw the ad for a driving position they said it was $21.00 per hour I end up getting the job and the day before I go out on my run I'm told they pay 0.43 cents per mile. Nowhere on the ad did they say they pay cents per mile...you drive 1,800-2,000 miles in 4 days and put in 10-12 hour days you're suppose to have off on Wednesday but they are so short on drivers they make you come in on your days off and run a local run and they still pay you cents per mile...you have to pay for your own hotel and they reimburse in your paycheck..so for example my paycheck every week is $1,075 and that's with them reimbursing me the $200-$300 I'm putting out every week for hotels..so if you take away the $200-$300 they reimburse you after all the work you put in your check is really anywhere from $700-$875 a week after all the hours and miles you do it isnt worth it..dont work here also they put cameras in the trucks to watch you"
bad,"Ryder is a fast paced factory and does not pay much. Ryder's hours are short and you hardly ever work the full 8 hours for your shift. If you're really depending on the hours, this is not the place for you."
bad,"It was a good  stable job, with good benefits. Safe and, clean work environment. I worked with great people. I learned a lot about product management  even though  I was a porter."
bad,"You  work usually 50 hours a week . Pretty laid back, but also fast paced. I would recommend working here . Worst part is working on the weekend from time to time."
bad,A typical day consist of 20-25 phone calls at the most. 10-15 calls are made for every one call you take. Management is unorganized and do not communicate well. Hardest part of job is environment.
bad,"This is a great company to work for, unfortunately the customer account I worked on was forced to stop using Ryders services due to going out of business. I was informed there were no other open positions within the department forcing me to look for an outside position."
bad,"was brought up if you don't have something good to say don't say anything!!!!!!!!!!!!! to old to change now . I could but they are not worth it. Start at 7am check all work order .42 dock to check inside lights out side lights check dock brakes dock doors 24 hour operation. rest room, fork lifts , scooters , batteries for both, and so much more. how to do change over , hang pvc , repair water plugs, fix and replace over head doors, fix and replace dock brake system. and  more. was not good learn more by reading manuals. culture was a do as i say not as i do . hardest part doing to much and not getting paid . going home with out getting hurt."
bad,too many hours in a week. was not informed it was working in cold storage for danon yogurt until started. 11 hr days 5-6 days a week mandated by managment. need to go to 3 shifts 8 hrs a day. or you will never keep people. everyone wants to leave. no work life balance. everyone angry at each other not healthy
bad,Not a recommended place to work. This is managed poorly. If you don't have friends in upper management then there is no room for advancement. Supervisors have poor managment
bad,"Terrible work culture, people arguing all day, customers are rude, terrible place to work, drains everything out of you and you are never happy to be there."
bad,There's never a typical work day. Processes change from day to day so you are on your own. No guarantee of what time your work day will actually end. If this is your thing- It will be your dream job.
bad,"The over all environment is good, however your day to day environment depends on your teams manager and varies widely. Learned Shipment management and all aspects of managing the transportation industry. Most difficult part of the job is sitting and staring at Excel for hours."
bad,"I received a job as a Shop Supervisor for a transportation company who fixed tractors and trailers.  Without any knowledge of vehicle maintenance it was tough to gain the respect of the technitiancs I was leading.  After gaining there trust the job ran more smoothly, however, it was too fast paced to where breaks and lunches were unthinkable.  The compensation was great, and the company as a whole is good, unfortunately we were too short staffed and the shop could have been ran better."
bad,"Compensations is fair and there is opportunities for advancement.  However, the company culture is not employee friendly and motivation is often fear and disciplinary based."
bad,Ryder is a fast paced distribution warehouse for Nestle Inc.  There are changes that are continually made with no real plan of execution prior to making the changes.  Daily overtime for the warehouse staff to complete the shipping schedule.  Product production is greater than the capacity of the storage building.  The group of co-workers are great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the very cold temperatures that need to be kept to store the food products.
bad,I've read the other comments and most of the negative comments are true.Their safety procedures are way over the top. You are not allowed to make a mistake. If you do they treat you like a child. No respect what so ever.
bad,"Ryder/Whirlpool is an okay place to work nice people friendly atmosphere,but the pay is not consistent with the economy ,nor are the rasies. Has many eqiuptment malfunctions with hand scanners and the employee  turnover rate is tremendisly high."
bad,Didn't last to long job relocated and had no further placement for me.
bad,"Started on 1st shift. Coworkers, supervisors, managers were well respected. Really enjoyed working with because we worked together as a team through quality, safety, then productivity. The supervisors were well oriented and cared about their workers. Was working as a temp, was out of my 90 day probation period with the company for a good 3 1/2 months. Human Resource did not push my application in until I volunteered for 3rd shift and then pushed application in immediately. "
bad,en esta empresa aprendi a ser montacarguista es con lo que me quedo ademas de aprender a ser responsable con mi trabajo
bad,"Ancient software, ancient hardware (computers, chairs), no organization."
bad,"Ryder would be a better company to work for, if they practiced what they preached. Safety is a task for ""ALL"" not just the employee. If you are required to perform safely. A company should provide and maintain a safe work environment. The Ryder facilities are worn older locations that are not kept up to a high standard. Compared to a Penske location. Upper management is too quick in blaming the employee instead of repairing or replacing broken equipment. Enter at your own risk!"
bad,Great company to start your career in either sales or operations in the transportation business  can advance locally or have the capabilities to move around the country to advance to the next level  just be cautious as to where you relocate to. Management in the company is different in every area and sometimes does not match up with your point of view on running the business
bad,New contract screwed us out of bonuses and they still Force dispatch you. Yes union jobs union dues on top of that. And they still give your job away to private contractor certain parts of the year. Why am I paying union dues.
bad,My experience with Ryder hasn’t been great because the company is going through a down business cycle in the trucking industry.  Morale isn’t great because of certain cutbacks. Their technology within the Sales operations is based upon 1990s computer software. They are flexible with time management.
bad,"Management does not know how to schedule work for technicians. Consistently moving multiple trucks to get one into the shop, or having to work outside because the shop is full. Forced to juggle multiple roles,such as fueling, and answering phones on weekends while being expected to complete lengthy lists of work."
bad,"technicians are underpaid, the benefits are terrible, it is the best option in a bad industry. the money on the rental counter is not terrible, but you do not work 40 hours and you are noti given the option to avoid overtime."
bad,"Typical day was a 10 hour marathon of fixing issues, helping employees and administrative functions with very little support - from employees below me as a Lead and management above.  While I did learn to operate PIVs, search databases to fix issues, and work self-directed, the management of our local site was complicated by us being in contract with another company which micro-managed us, which made working there difficult such as deciding to change our computer tracking software while in the middle of a ramp-up in business volume, but not approving the hiring of more people.  Despite working 60 hours Monday to Friday, I was pressured to work on my weekends too, and every day seemed to have a new policy or process change."
bad,"Ryder is literally the easiest place you will ever work, the system and the lifts are very easy to pick up, it's just everything else associated with Ryder that make it terrible. Extremely poor management, tons of favoritism - they'll fire people over the most asinine reasons while other employees are untouchable. Definitely not an equal or fair place to work. After you've been here for a year or two they'll look for reasons to fire you. Because of their tremendous firing sprees expect to work mandatory overtime ALL year round due to being understaffed. If you want to make a quick buck for a year or so Ryder will suit you, just don't expect to be around much longer than that. Trust no one, every employee there wants you fired for some reason or another, super hostile workplace. Definitely wouldn't recommend this job to anyone looking for a steady job. Also the rules change everyday, just another way they'll find to fire you."
bad,Paper work would be ready some of the times. Trailer would be loaded very poorly most of the times. Report unsafe conditions to management nothing would be done to change unsafe load conditions.
bad,"Ryder Creates the illusion like it is a  great company to work for, but they are average. Ryder pays a little bit more than most company but the back load the driver position with a lot of Restrictions that are that Stifling .They have 2 way  Dash cameras  in all there Tractors on dedicated accounts. They want to know what you are doing while driving,because your are being recorded by the DashCam.  So why do I still work at RYDER, well for 1 I don't care about there freaking dash cam 2 I  have been accident free before working for Ryder and still am accident free and most important  thing,There is a major major shortage of experience CDL CLASS A Drivers ... 3) I have never missed a day from work  wether it rains ,snow or shine(sunny)..."
bad,"A lot of politics, needs better organization but a great set of workers."
bad,"Pay is no where near commensurate for the amount of work you do there. If they promise you a certain dollar figure get it in writing or else they have selective memory loss. "
bad,They preach transparency and LEAN culture but when metrics would dip into the red I would be asked on multiple occasions to fluff the numbers based on vastly inaccurate logic.
bad,A typical work day for me is I come in and work list that is laid out for me. That have to be done by the end of the day. But have a hard time getting thing done right the first time do to the customer drivers always wanting me to fix something at the last second when they depart and getting back to what I was working on and start all over.Then have the customer always asking when will the truck be done every few minutes. I have learned a lot form getting my hand dirty and figure out how think run. My coworker are fun to work with not bad to deal wither ether. The hardest part about my job is pleasing the customer and everyone else around trying to make everyone happy don't always pan out very good. The most enjoyable about my job is getting to use my brain like on wiring of truck  that some people just cant figure out
bad,This is a logistics service where you must locate drivers on route. Must monitor trucking companies and their drivers to ensure delivery of products will be made on time.
bad,"the work was fine good equipment to work on "
bad,My work day starts with me doing a mental check of organizing my thoughts according to the tasks that need to be completed. Keeping in mind that life can sometimes bring about its own changes. One must be willing to make adjustments in life.
bad,Racist managers who can’t hold their tongue back to keep inappropriate conversations out of the work place. ..........................................
bad,"I was specifically coached by my VP to fire at least 1 sales rep annually to maintain ""fear"" and ""motivation"".   I was mentored to manage in a certain style by my VP, then stabbed in the back when fired for doing exactly what he requested."
bad,Night shift supervisor discrimitive i don't like you will make you wanna quit. Company makes promises to you about extra pay around holidays but always a catch.
bad,Its all about satifying the customers needs and employees feel and get treated like just another number. Employees don't feel safe and continues to be over worked.
bad,Ryder has too many things it tries to accomplish.  The service departments are overwhelmed and our customers are not happy.  I'm aggressively looking for another job and I'm out of here the minute I find one.
bad,Days are not typical because your start and end times change at a moments notice. You start out on 2nd shift ( which sometimes bleeds into 3rd shift) and it is near impossible to get moved to first. Management plays favorites and treats everyone differently based on personal relationships. The workers are all hard working but unfairly treated and deemed replaceable. Management and HR actually tell us this far too often. They have no compassion for family or personal issues. They'd rather replace than work with you. Job itself is easy and repetitive
bad,"Every department is different at Ryder. A typical day consist of meeting deadlines, working at a rapid pace with minimal mistakes, working with no supervision, and maintaining exceptional customer service at all times. While working at Ryder I have  learned how to mulitask at a rapid rate to meet the needs of customers. I have also developed tough skin in the few months of working here along with insight in regardes to transportation."
bad,"The supervisor does not have enough experience."
bad,"Pro- coworker is friendly and helpful"
bad,"management does not respond but wants employee to drop everything and respond to them. hard to get a call back from management,which is reason why i am no longer working there."
bad,Overly worked for what little pay you get. Competitors pay around 5$more than what RYDER will. Health benefits are overly expensive. Raises are basically non existent. Managment only cares about getting there numbers. It's a great place to start out to get experience but would recommend going somewhere that pays better unless or is a union shop where they treat you and pay you what your actually worth.
bad,"Management is out of touch with the staff."
bad,I use to be in the army i have 2 boys i am married i have reliable transportation to work i am a hard worker an very reliable i drove a forklift a high reach an a sit down lift all day every day
bad,The leadership rolls don't care about the little problems that could change the core of the company. This place is known for inconsistencies and has been brought out a few times that I am aware of. This could easily be a great place to work for and grow with if everyone could get on the same page. Good luck!
bad,"Shuttling trailers from the plant to the Jeep plant 6 days a week 12 hr days."
bad,"It was a great job when I started there.  In the years that followed, there was a succession of managers, some were excellent, some were awful.  A number of us left the company in disgust with the last manager.  We felt frustrated to the point of leaving the company over differences of opinion as to how our jobs should be done as opposed to how they were done in the past.  Morale in that warehouse is at an all-time low."
bad,Seniority based work hours so unless you've been the 5 plus years you will more than likely be 3rd shift working 12 to 14 hour days 5 to 6 days a week. Would not recommend this job for anyone with family who are not on a 3rd shift schedule. I saw my family on Saturdays when I got up and about a half a day sunday before I went to bed. The pay is good as well as benefits. Job would be great for single persons who enjoy working long hours and through the night.
bad,ryder was just the logistics most of the problem was with the account we haul for pore communication from both parties issues dealt with short term  then resumed.
bad,"not enough advancement, lack of pay what we did here most companies was paying there worker 18.00 hrs.could have a better management team.i work over an beyond on the job to much people been a busy body around the company.i kept to myself didn't carry about the mess."
bad,"love the people. great hours and pay, the palce was always too hot. place was was never recpetive to needing time off. too many hours at times. never gave time off"
bad,"Disappointed, not what i expected. Old outdated systems, terrible IT it takes forever to get something done with so much bureaucracy! It gets boring after a while. Not the kind of a company I would recommend to my friends."
bad,"this place was an ok place to work at I learned a lot by working there ,the management there sucks ,the co workers were friendly the only problem I had there was the pay, sometimes your check would come up missing"
bad,"Es una empresa americana con un ambiente laboral excelente, he aprendido muchas cosas buenas durante los 5 años que llevo laborando lo mas dificil es la rotación de personal."
bad,I completed a variety of odd jobs to fulfill the supply chain for a GM distribution center.  We had to complete daily routes to properly service GM parts centers
bad,Switched trailers out at Latrobe Steel.  Drove to the Franklin facility and dropped and hooked.  Went to Orbit Industries in Middleburg Heights unloaded material that needed to be tested and loaded material that was tested and took it back to Franklin where I dropped and hooked and returned materal back to Latrobe
bad,"One thing for sure about Ryder is, their management is excellent. It's a solid company with a HUGE emphasis on safety. So much so that it is completely overbearing. Every month, you are required to log-in to this software known as ""Pro-tread"" and complete a new topic. Also you must do an even more thorough topic quarterly. It is the most annoying and demoralizing part of my job. Not too mention, you will be inundated with correspondence in the mail detailing any safety violations the system thinks you have. Regardless of whether or not they are excused. It is literally pushing me away from this company. Additionally their benefits aren't that great. If you have a family, be prepared to pay around $400.00 a month for medical. What I hate about this is the union guys pay a fraction of that, yet, we work for the same company. How the heck is that fair? Had I known, I would never have accepted their job offer. On my way out the door asap."
bad,"the management, environment, and fellow co workers were just terrible and not easy to get along with. They paid terrible for the jobs that you had to do."
bad,"drove cdl b out of nj to 5 boros and long island.47cpm sounds good but no more then 500 to 700 miles per week.touch freight which i prefer.acct closed I was moved to acct 2 hrs from home temp.ryder paid 55 cpm and fuel plus 46cpm to shuttle a 53' trailer to jersey city abour 2.5 hours away.thats was a good pay check. it came to an end,very strict about saftey,which is good to a point,forget to put on seatbelt once and theyll try to fire you,even if you drive 30 feet  ,verbal,.call in to operator when you leave for work,on my unpaid time,cameras in the cab facing you,elogs which dont work,i just kept paper logs.they follow you around on your route sometimes.low pay,high turnover rate as with all other mega carriers.they talk a good game but r the same as any other big comp.better off going ltl and getting paid by the hr and o.t.dispatcher was nice mgr was ok.found this comp. to have childish practices in some areas,not a kool aid drinker,just wanna work hard and not be bothered w/ petty bs like why were you late for appt in bronx........traffic is backed up for 3 hrs on the GW.they dont seem to understand that.found more suitable job w/ better pay."
bad,Needs to streamline training program. And revise pay scale
bad,"great working experience but time for a change , ur achievements go un notice"
bad,"If like being micromanaged with a camera on you over any little thing you do, this is the job for you. Can’t wait to find something else. They are more worried about the camera facing the driver than the load being on time or safety issues. Give em a try. They suck"
bad,"alot of training and help, workers are great, management is terrible, any advancement is all about who's butt you kiss. pay scale was lied to, told at top pay for tech level, quit and others at same level all of a sudden get a raise cause they fear more guys would leave due to in-acquit  pay. benefits are great 2 weeks after starting, 3 weeks after 5 and 4 after 15, 1 week sick etc. poor management, even above me skipping over people that have been there 20 years and basically ran the shop to move in another that per say sucked up to management for supervisor job etc. hard to get fired.. so if in with below par worker.. you have to deal with em. cause they will write em up 500 times before firing them."
bad,"excluding the service manager the fellow employees were not friendly and back stabbing. The actual work environment was ok working on vehicles alright. The pay was fair not great , I would not recommend working at the I-17 and Blackcanyon location."
bad,"poor management in hagerstown location, excellent co-workers, good pay rates. facility too small. work environment can be made more stressful then needed."
bad,Ryder was a great employer but sometimes the management did not know enough about what their workers were doing in the warehouse. but over all this was a pleasant work experience. Sorry that they closed this facility...
bad,The job was a cool job to have if you are looking for a part time job that does not pay a lot. Everyone that I worked with was cool and understanding but the pay sucks.
good,"we are doing home deliveries, sometime is not good because the company pay for delibery and we to do the job for free,"
good,"I worked for Ryder MMC in Roswell for 2 years and it was mostly a bad experience. We were underpaid, had little advancement opportunities and would be disciplined for being 1min late. For anyone seeking employment, I would only work there for a short amount of time. This is not one of those  organizations that you want to hang around long term."
good,Management in this BU area is more worried saving money and cutting over time than taking care of customers and repairing trucks right the first time. And treating employees with respect and fairness. Training has gone down hill to becoming a joke for employees.  And also when replacing service manager. They don't hire within they company anymore. They hire from outside the company who have no knowledge of tucking industry and no knowledge of the in and out of how Ryder works.  If you get hired here you have been warned. Stay way from the Carolina BU. Ryder as a company is great company.  Just at ground level it has become a joke.
good,this job was payed based on performance and the job market for the product if the product was not being sold you did not work and if they over sold the product they expected miracles from the drivers this job was 100% commission based You were on the road 3 to 5 days a week and expected to do a lot more then safe to  do so
good,"Very easy job and fast paced, the only downside is that you get no paid time off and you must work every other Saturday or every Saturday when your told last minute. you only make fourteen dollars an hour so does the rest of the warehouse and on top of all this you get told in the beginning of the day if your either working eight hours or ten hours and you have no say about it. very hard to make plans for weekends but it is such a common sense job. My advice to you is that if you work here don't get caught up in all the things that they seem to complain about and worry about day in and day out. everyone expects you to know everything right off the bat it isn't a place that just isn't managed well. its overmanaged and to a t."
good,"I drove stand-up forklift in a refrigerated warehouse, i also loaded and unloaded semi-trailors.i was in charge of order picking, putting pallets of different items together to complete large orders.up to 2500 cases. the most enjoyable part of my job was making no mistakes on my orders that i picked.Very nice co-workers, i made many friends that i still communicate with.I learned that operating a forklift was skill that i possesed and loved."
good,I mean it gave me assembly experince and that was cool pay was ok but could be more and the way things work are not all good at all
good,Cold 36 degrees all day decent place to make a check lots of favoritism going on and if u weren't there when the doors open your extremely disposable managment is horrible they have ppl in managment spots who were in fast food previously ....I made alot of money here and u work 3.5 days a week but they always mandate if they dont get volunteered poor communication skills through the entire warehouse
good,Do more and watch your peers do less.  Don't do more and no one does it.  Don't always think you are being told the truth when your future is on the line.  Unless it effected them directly it wasn't their problem.  Upper Management and the hours.  Peers were great
good,"Ryder is not what they say, HR will lie to your face to protect their managers.  Advancement in the company is slow moving and the buddy system is in effect either your are in the click or you get ran off or you get all the bad work. Managers will retaliate of you report them and if you tell HR management retaliated they will tell you that they don't believe it, so in short think long and hard about working at Ryder"
good,Ryder had many events throughout the year to keep their employees intrigued to be at Ryder. The recruiting department had it's ups and downs on what types of Drivers and Mechanics that would apply for job postings. kept work interesting to say the least.
good,"I worked the worst shift possible 4pm-4am 7days a week, then off 7 days, back on for 5 days off for 3 days on 6 days.  could not get a day shift or normal schedule"
good,"They will lie, use, and abuse you... You will come in to orientation and they will say they are going to do this that and the third for you but it never gets done. There isn't a chance for advancement unless you're the supervisors ""favorite"". Upper management doesn't care about your health, family, or anything that could be taking place. If you're in desperate need of a job I would recommend other than that please try your luck somewhere."
good,Third Party logistics so lots of temp employees. In some ways they are treated better than the ryder employees as far as time off and attendance.
good,truck driving is more for single people I didn't like itlong hours
good,"The accounts are not difficult its management and your peers that makes it challenging. You can't trust anyone and everyone is out for self and doesn't know how to be fair or treat others with respect. If you are part of the in click you get what you want but if you are working hard and don't complain you get walked on and never privy to anything. "
good,"trabajabamos en un almacen, en la empresa Carrier De MExico, por lo cual teniamos el transporte al area de trabajo gratis por 'parte de la empresa, pero el salario era muy poco para as funciones que ahi realizamos."
good,"Solia ser un buen lugar de trabajo, con el tiempo cambio mucho es un ambiente hostil, no hay oportunidad de crecimiento, hay muchos supervisores con falta de experiencia sin control de los empleados. Tiene muy buenas prestaciones. La Gerencia nunca esta presente."
good,Unorganized and an extream lack of follow through. People here tend to not do anything about proper buisness practices until it becomes an HR issue. Poor communication
good,This place was the worst place I ever worked they didnt care about you or your family life they pay you little to nothing and dont care to pay you that . I would never work there again or tell anyone else to work with them
good,"Management and HR does not handle problems in a professional way . The workplace culture is horrific . I have never worked in a place where basically employees do whatever they want to and get away with it...why have a supervisor ? The job is great but management needs a great deal of improvement. GM does not run this way neither should Ryder. The material handler positions are very good jobs to do , however there is a lot of employee issues that get swept under the carpet."
good,My time at Ryder was a learning experience. I enjoyed working security and as their shipping and receiving clerk. I also enjoyed operating the variety of forklifts but didn't enjoy the cold temperatures inside of the warehouse.
good,"I worked at a Ryder location through a staffing agency. I was hired as a lead but quickly took over the role of Warehouse Supervisor due to my experience and knowledge. I was given a small raise but still was employed by the staffing agency. It started off really fun there but quickly devolved into backstabbing and nonsense. I ran the warehouse for six months and never received a job offer from Ryder even though they continued to dangle it in front of me like an invisible carrot.  Upper management was a joke here and as the warehouse supervisor,  I constantly found myself making way more decisions than my pay would have suggested I should be making. They closed the building on us with no advance notice."
good,I worked the 4am until 7am shift.I was there working with drivers to get them on the road to start their day.I would receive them to end their day as well as mine. By placing keys in designated location . Entering all info from logs in excel.Writing out garage reports for vans that needed repairing.
good,You're a just number they do not care about compensation or sleep patterns also a lot of favoritism but long as you show up you will get a paycheck have a good day
good,"management continuously changing"
good,Great environment if you like 2 faced managers who will praise you to your face and trash you behind your back.  40+ hours a week inside of a building with no windows.  The only way to get promoted is if you know someone or have your nose far up someone’s backside.  What makes it all ok though is a ping pong table and a monthly lunch right?  That’s what management believes.
good,"In regards to Ryder HQ, there is a deep calcified culture of, for lack of a better term, ""old school mentality."" Superficially they recognize the need to modernize their business processes, but in actuality fail to realize they need to first modernize their company culture in order for that to happen. "
good,"Manager verbally abused at least one driver while I was there and gossiped about other workers. Drivers were underpaid considering the hours that some worked and owed back pay due to incompetence in management. Management used office workers and drivers as scapegoats for his mistakes.  It was sad to see that the drivers had nobody at their backs. They wouldn't complain even if there were anyone to help, which there was not, for fear of losing their jobs. Not a great office to work for.  Corporate needs to step in to talk with employees anonymously to see what really goes on in this office"
good,"Unless you are in the ""clique"" with your management staff kiss promotions and advancement goodbye. A giant high school, but with more expensive food and better shoes."
good,Coworkers were great but management was not. After Ryder took over the benefits went down hill and so did the working environment. The only plus was that there was a ton of over time because the turn over rate was so high.
good,A lot of games played with the workers. lots of layoffs. Good learning experience. Lots of area to learn different positions. Paid holidays and paid vacation days. no sick days...
good,"blahh blahh, blah.,bs, bs, bs, bs...this is total bs, hoew come I havew to do this s,,,how do you like my review????? almost there just need couple more"
good,"I really enjoyed the job I preformed daily, the supervisors and other employees were good, The tough part was the hours that changed weekly. Sunday night Mon Night Tue off Wed Day Thurs Day Fri Day Saturday Day and Sunday night. The switch between sleeping was tough."
good,"You slave away and get paid the same as someone who is lazy."
good,"Go to work and do what is assigned, not much was learned because if anyone knew any way that was easier to complete the job at hand they kept it to themselves. Management and co-workers were like a clique in high school one had to agree with everything they said or was outcasted."
good,"Everyday we were micro managed, the people are great but management is worthless plus they don't know how to talk to their employees."
good,I worked for Ryder as a contract delivery driver for there Ashely furniture account in Tacoma. There’s not much good to say about the whole operation besides the other delivery drivers you get to share your experience with on a daily basis. Extremely long hours with minimal pay. Continuously fixing others mistakes while out on the field and not being compensated for it unless it benefits them. I could go on for days but I feel I’ve said enough m.
good,Manager don't know the meaning of respect or professionalism. There is so many things to do for a company to evaluate every single manager not only by the immediate boss but also by the associate. That's a rigth everybody have.
good,"If you know the typical warehouse being cold like it is outside in the winter and super hot inside while in the summer with Quaker Oats brand named junk food stored everywhere, then I just described to you what it is like to work at the Ryder / PepsiCo warehouse in Cedar Rapids."
good,"expect 10-12 hour days"
good,The work culture is very clickish. If you’re not favored by the management or in good with the management fee usually stagnated. The Ryder TMC in Fort Worth Texas has a very high turn over Due in part to the poor management and like I love actual training program. New employees are sat at a desk ito watch someone else work for a day or so and then thrown in to work. When you reach out to human resources to discuss issues they are not kept privately as they should be.
good,"Okay for middle management"
good,I really enjoy the work I do at Ryder Logistics unfortunately I have been here for over a year and no full time employee in site. Its very discouraging. I want to be valued as a employee and I'm not. no benefits or paid holidays. Im ready to find a new place of employee where I can continue to put in 100% and receive the benefits as a employee.
good,I've been working here for almost 3 years the work isn't a heavy routine I've always done inventory control also select orders the management is fair .
good,"Not a bad place to work if you dont mind long hours in the freezing cold.  there is not work life balance, just ryder.  You can move up after a couple years but as you move up the more and more your work life balance will become unreasonable."
good,I was working way too many overtime hours that it could of been dangerous and I feel like my supervisor only made me do the overtime. I didn't feel like I was safe working those hours for third shift and then having to drive home afraid I might fall asleep.
good,"In my early years in my career Ryder was the company I worked hard to be able to qualify to be able to work there, I used to work contracts for them, and they were awesome. Some where something went wrong and when I finally got hired, I discovered that it was only a shell of what it used to be. Bad management made employees miserable. I just came in and tried to do my job and go home, We were always kept in the dark, like when they lost my contract I was told exactly  the day we were laid off."
good,ryder would be a good company but when they start a change they hit you with 4 or 5 changes and want you to learn them in a short amount of time. the work place could use more morals
good,"I worked inside our customer (General Motors) Lordstown facility.  The relationships built with the customer our critical to the success of my team and the customer.  I enjoy sharing the goals of my customer which was cost, cost, cost.  Lower cost through efficiency and cost avoidance tactics.  At times, work life balance leans toward a lack of ""life"" outside of work as we often dedicate all hours to ensure that production does not stop because of a lack of supply of parts or material.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with the corporate human resources aspect of the job.  The in plant teams are removed from most of the formal process and must function alone at times.  There is a lack of support since their are too many employees under one HR coordinator."
good,A typical day at work consists of getting yelled at by customers and upper management. Management does not value their employees. Only way to move up is to relocate or kiss up.
good,wait to long to move plus pays bad for the time out you will wait 2 hours to move to next place and time out is 14 hours not good pay
good,"Ryder does not care about is employees. Expect low pay and hardly any raises. I work for a major company that does not respect the extra things you do on a daily basis. Management is poor, and only looks out for self"
good,The job was only for temps still felt under payed because of the hard work. Wasn't granted a whole 40 hr check. The staff was very helpful.The hours was good
good,esta mal organisada la gente no ponian mucha atencion en lo q nos faltaba a nosotros como empleados
good,They are rand ok company with very poor management.They don't treat there employees right and very hostile work environment.
good,"I have been with Ryder for more than 11 years, greatest group of co workers I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. They are always willing to help and give personal and professional encouragement."
good,"Decent place to work, good work/life balance.  Little chance to advancement have to be ""in"" with management."
good,"Responsible for all aspects of supply chain operations including scheduling, requisition, analysis, continuous improvement and safety requirements."
good,"Just ridiculous commute through Philadelphia 1.5-2hrs. Chew you up & spit you out. The sell you on movement upward & even laterally to make your life easier but nothing is followed through. An immense amount of operational expectations, yet at the end of the day the only thing that dictates a “good” employee is marketing to existing customers... because you only get credit"
good,If you like money and hate free time and being treated like a person then this is the job for you. You'll never know when you did something that is suddenly a rule and will get you fired. This place really keeps you on your toes.
good,"The training I received helped me achieve my original goal to work as a recruiter from home and make a better living without any stress.  The people that did get higher positions were promoted because of who they knew and not from their education, skills or experience.  It is a large corporation built by one man only to grow into a seriously bad managed company.  I did make some new friends that I will keep in my life for many years to come."
good,"It's an ok place to work. Benefits are horrible though and expensive. They take years to give there employees a raise, and what makes this job ok is the account you're on."
good,Ryder was owned by individual people in different locations. In 2002 or 2003 Budget bought Ryder they are no longer in business. They have not been open for years and when they closed we all lost our jobs.
good,"Worked with a team that supported a 3PL contract.  The management I reported to was focused of what they thought the customer wanted and not what they asked for, with an attitude of the customer did not know what they wanted."
good,"not enough pay"
good,"As with most large companies, there are lots of opportunities to move to different positions and levels within Ryder. Each position is different and you can find your niche. Some people have been there over 30 years."
good,"it's not a bad place to work, it needs better IT leadership. it has some of that at the lower management level but not at the top levels. the decision making there is terrible at best."
good,This business truely pushes you to be your best. It's basically demands it. You certainly grow as a person while working here. But with that being said work life balance is not very even. More like a 70%/30% split.
good,"Good job for the most part. If you want to learn and grow, it is all up to you. Ryder is a very generous company and they will take care of you. Management is poor and biased. There is no structure for training and onboarding. Technology is outdated but it is enough to get the job done."
good,"They really used to care about employees in the maintenance department when I started. But after time it did a complete turn around. After 5 Shop Managers in 10 years, they all became yes men. Yes to the upper management and let the lower people suffer. Towards the end I applied for a higher job and didn't get it, ok, but then they made me train the new guy with no experience. And my last 2 managers started shaving time of my time card. That finally was it, when I brought it to HR, they said it was trivial, goodbye Ryder."
good,"Management didn't know the work on the floor, depended on team leads to much. Team leads not compensated for that. Management not very friendly with employees.  They seemed to have a quota on writing employees up every month.  Management seemed lost and confused because they could never come up with consistant work procedures.  Last contract between UAW and Ryder is five years with no raises.  Employees get a small bonus every year.  The cost of insurance is high so take home pay isn't what it should be."
good,"Poor Management, stressful, poor communication... did't tell you what you had to do. you had to figure it out on your own. and if you didn't do it their way you got in trouble."
good,It was ok the work we did we should of made alot more. They could careless about there works . And to lay us off with no notice was very unprofessional.
good,"Only been employed less than a month so I haven't really formed an all around opinion about the company. So far most of my co-workers are friendly, helpful, and fair."
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. The transportation industry has seen a lot of changes and will always be needed. Unfortunately, outsourcing  impacted a lot of families locally."
good,Instead of covering everything that you would need to know when hired they just throw you to the wolves and you have to figure things out on your own. Managers are overloaded with no help for day to day operations. Not impressed with this company at all.
good,"Good work day when you don't have to deal with Mgmnt, "
good,"During my time at Ryder, I would work with a partner to locate damaged product, remove the damage and record the data, then re-stack and wrap pallets. Sweeping and maintaining a clean warehouse overall."
good,"A typical day was changing into bibs and winter coat. I worked in a cooler. I learned to operate a stand-up reach forklift."
good,fun place to work great enivoriment team were awesome to work with fun transportation clerkust fun place
good,"Lots of hours and money to be made, terrible staff and management, forget having weekends and holidays off. Also, you'll be working in the cold 24/7."
good,"The account I was on, paid by the load and I didn't like it. Go to work early in the morning and get off late. Good benefits.Home everyday."
good,Management was inconsiderate of it's employees well being. The technicians were are great group to assist. The bitter cold of working in a non-heated environment was brutal. I would pull product for the technicians on a daily basis. Restocked product and ordered product as needed.
good,"Liked the work. All drop and hook which was cool.  Hauled Toyota parts to Ar. and San Antonio, Tx.  The problem occured when we had more drivers than bids, so I became an extra board driver.  Well that went to heck in a hand basket.  We got a new supervisor and when he found out I had office experience he pulled me in the office to straighten out the files, etc..  Then my trucking time was nil.  So, I quit and found another job."
good,"A typical day at Ryder was , palletizing , then loading your freight onto a trailer , and then making the deliveries ."
good,Ryder is a massive corporation who espouses customer care as their leading principal.
good,While i worked here i learned a lot and enjoyed working with the many other people who worked there aswell
good,Management needed to be more supportive
good,"I worked at Ryder for 14 years, they do seem to lose alot of accounts. I worked at 4 different accounts while with them. When the account is gone, so is your job unless they can find something for you. It was all good until the last account, very tight schedules with little time home (10 hours) between routes. Yes, some accounts allow you to be home daily. I would suggest trying it, but if the account is very tight your health is more important! Management won't work with you on tight schedules and do expect your full 70 hours. The last account I worked at was working 70 hours in 5 days. Driver unload. Other accounts are different. Good benefits."
good,Should start at 17 and add better benefits cant plan anything due to company forcing overttime on your days or nights off.should have 401k as a benefit and better bonus plan then what's currently in place
good,"Not stable, not balanced.  No work life balance.  Extremely hard to plan ahead.  Extremely high turn over rate.  Being understaffed increased the overtime, which in turn increases the turn over."
good,The only good benefit about working at Ryder is the starting salary for all entry level positions is 17.00 hr . The Call center is drama and barely any overtime offered if overtime is given the leads pick based on who they like the most . Barely room for advancement in this position
good,I did enjoy my time here but the hours were not long enough to live on. It was easy work moving trucks from one locale to another. Staff was easy to work with.
good,"With the highs and lows  market and economy, when it's on its on and when it's off it's really off. You can sell well and get customers on board, but management is very hands off, unless your performance starts to suffer, then they come in try and motivate and leave. Training and development seemed almost non existent. Struggle with service issues and staff"
good,Overall it's a good company to work for. The work is not to hard depending on what department your in you can get alot if overtime . It's a pretty laid back company to work for
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is developing talent, coaching. Teaching new and existing employees safer and efficient ways to do there jobs."
good,Pay is not that good they have you doing lots of stuff you get a raise ones a year and the top out is like 16 bucks and you dont advance they hire people out side the company.
good,A lot of Ryder jobs are secured contracts. Salary average is $1100 to $1400 before taxes. Most contracts are long term. Most average 5yrs. Ryder demands a lot from the driver. NO pay raises. Bait you in with a sign on bonus. Spoon feed it to you over 90 days. They will buy back your vacation. At end of year. Camera in 90% of tractors. Micro managed.
good,"Supervisors are lazy  they just there for a paycheck, coworkers were great, office people are nice, gm and operation managers don't go out on the floor to see what's really going on  dock"
good,Could be a great company if they were not the middleman.  At my location management are great people.  But communication could have been better. Also too many discrepancies regarding routes and pay.
good,"I was a data entry clerk, it was cool, nothing hard about it at all once you actually learned what it is you were doing.  There was really no training at all, just a quick run through and that was it, so I would say you need to be a quick and attentive learner."
good,"mobile technician for ryder.  travelled in excess of 250 miles each day, going to customer locations.  always on call 24/7"
good,"the job is pretty easy. It use to be very relaxed ( too relaxed) they are cracking down to get things in order. However, its a new big boss who is firing everyone to bring people from his previous job in. hes firing people that been with the company longer than 4-5 years to bring in someone he worked with previously straight to supervisor and lead positons. its been a lot of politics going on. He is very power hungry and he tell leads to look for reasons to fire people."
good,"Poor management with attitude, schedule will change daily giving you an uncomfortable life balance, sometimes coming to work 2, 3 even 4 hour before the contract scheduled, sometimes doing the same but cutting the hour at the end. Never know at what time you leave or how much you making a week."
good,"Ryder has changed so much in the last ten years."
good,"Worked at the Obetz, Ohio facility, and it was a joke. Even though they pay well, the Management Staff is something to see in person. The Management staff does not care that the building looks like mess, and that their are spills and product laying around everywhere. They only care when a visitor is coming in, or when they get bored. The Ops. Mgr that they have on 1st Shift  likes to yell and intimidate everyone. There are a good group of workers there and the morale is low due to the fact that no one is appreciated for the work that gets done. They keep who they want, and get rid of the good people. There is hardly any training that is done, and there are so many new people, no one gets trained properly and the people that have been there awhile have to do 90% of the work."
good,"They expect a lot from and give you no recognition for it. you have no room for advancment there is a very heavy workload, still make you work on holidays."
good,I really love the people but no money or room to grow in the company the managers don't care about the employees unless you are a truck driver. And that's my experience in ryder
good,The work mates are easy going and fun to get along. Good place to work at but sadly the salary wise is too low and long working hours. Management are nice and understanding too.
good,"I feel that management could be better.  The position is an easy one. "
good,Not really much complaints here.  The biggest issue was compensation. Of course it could of been better but grateful I did get the opportunity to learn a lot there
good,"The position was easy to me and very enjoyable, however when it came to promotions you had to be part of the ""Circle"". I applied multiple times for Supervisor and not once did I get an interview"
good,"Great co-workers (technicians) horrible management. Union shop. Shifts are unorganized and low seniority gets shafted (nights, graveyard or wknds). Good pay (weekly) with incentives. Facilities are old and falling apart. Can't fit longer units in the shop and close bay doors (sucks in winter). Have to fight for a bay some times or work outside. Locker room and lunch room are gross."
good,some ryder shop will treat you like family and then others will disrespect and do everything to destory your opportunity... it is very sad the way this job is.. not only this but the money in certain area is poor and you cant survive ... trust me i know and job dont care... i was an excellent employee but got treated unfairly .. other than that you can learn alot unless supervisor stopped you for advancement ...
good,Don't like the job anymore because there is no room for advancement or no raises in pay .That's all I know to say about the company.Besides the managers don't keep u informed what's going on in and around the company we do not have any safety meetings or breakfasts anymore for employee recognitions.
good,"Have to work long hours 6 and 7 days a week. No work life balance at all. Upper management does not seem to care. No initial training, had to pick things up."
good,Between the 3 sifts no work place camaraderie despite being a union shop sonority only helps with yearly sift bid management will pick and choose who they enforce the rules with
good,"Favoritism runs rampant, management is poor. The director of operations has a massive ego and yells at people even though they have been working hard all day. The company itself is okay, but everything else needs some work."
good,"delivery of tobacco at various locations,management was very weak at this location.culture was in place but not followed. the hardest part of the job was being pushed to do at least 6 calls an hour using a routing system that was poorly implemented and that management was well aware of but refused to rectify after many complaints from all reps.the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with all the different contacts through out the week and seeing my co workers on  a daily basis.There is a great core of reps at this location even with weak management."
good,"had to be available 24/7. Learn alot of management skills"
good,Has potential but to many changes happening at once. The benefits are decent and the pay is decent but too much extra added stress. Plenty of overtime when approved
good,In my opinion this is not allot of work life balance. Also the direction of the company seems to be ever changing. Approval process can be cumbersome.
good,"Inside a warehouse the winters are cold and the summers are hotter indoors. I was sent home for wearing shorts. Must wear thick uniform. Im not learning anything. in fact, I'm forgetting things I used to know. Management are major tools. People are funny. I like the people. Hardest part of the job is waking up at 4:20am and being so hot since we work hard and I'm sweating by the end of the day. Also it's dirty. it's dusty. Breathing dirty air into my lungs. They don't vacuum all the dust and then they have fans that blow it all around. Lots of males at my work have had heart problems. One even died at the age of 60-something. Enjoyable part of the job is sitting on my butt/listening to music and doing computer work."
good,"overall the shop is an okay, but management and workers are not to their qualifications. supplies are very/always limited, management not in total control of shop as well as parts, etc. very unorganized, no type of communication and even when there is, is of no good. "
good,Business culture driven by strict budgets often fail to upgrade antiquated systems. Business models themselves will be outdated by major advancements in automated driving and other companies like Amazon entering as competition
good,Have parties for best mixing centers. Very clean and being always safety is number one priority. A lot of overtime hours. Well paid and good benefits and vacations
good,"I operated a ride on electric pallet jack to pick orders, the job was fairly simple. The co-workers were cool but the 'lean' management was a joke. I ended up leaving for another employer just like many others there."
good,"I worked for 8 years at ryder overall its good but unfortunatly the opertunities within there are not much and its hard to grow within. The salaries if you want money you gotta be a perfect employee no mistakes no problem. Dont go against polacies and dont give your opinion as they will put you in your place ."
good,"Easy work , union , $17.45hr with night shift premiums ok insurance , people are nice , management ok , The boss is not a people person his managers under him have to carry his burdens , when he retires this will be a better place surely. You have to unhook everytime you bump the dock ."
good,Not a hard job or a bad place to work.  The hours can be a little long when working the weekend shift. Wish there was more opportunities available.  Not enough positions to move up to.
good,"Ryder is a very strong company but unfortunately the management at the North Smithfield terminal ""at the time of my employment""  they were very unconscious in regard of safety, employees safety concerns and complains were ignore for the most part."
good,No manager takes responsibilty for their actions. They use people who are in a lesser position as scapegoats to take the punishment.
good,"there was no real room for advancement, co-workers was great to work with, management expected a lot out of the employees"
good,Great job environment but tough to advance. Benefits are terrible.  Overall a good place to start your career but no where you want to be stuck at
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but not always for. The position was not what I was led to believe it would be when I started there."
good,This job was alot of experianceI learned alot and had good co worker that helped me when I didnt know how to do things. The only downfall was when work got slow you get laid off.
good,The first 5 yrs I learn a great deal about the 3rd party logistics operations. After that they put in charge upper management that had no experience with the business that we operated. This made things very difficult on a a daily basis for me and the employees that worked there.
good,"This company is a good company, it is just not for me.  The mentality here is not as professional as I want.  They are good people but I think they are willing to pay your worth."
good,"They own nothing, so your job is tied to the contracts they get and lose. No real level of job security. Also so since they are a contractor your compensation is based on the contract."
good,"Truck Driver, picked up and delivered Auto part to car plants."
good,Ryder has a good core value system but it is lost in local management. I can be a very negative place to work depending on who the mid level management is.
good,"As a typically day to work here is not bad;you learn that being a truck driver for this company is you have to put up with poor equiptment, bad managent, and low wages.Management  is extremely poor and arrogant, The personnel  this company hires for management are either have litte to no experience in Transportation or Logistics and won't listen to suggestions from long time employees. A high extreme presents of micro-management is always affect daily operations. A good example you have a saftey personnel actually following you within city limits, and look to see if are driving professionally, courtesy and defensively. And if not of course, you will be reprimand which can lead towards termination. Turn over rate for this company is very high with drivers record being damaged towards the management conducting this on a daily basis.Co-workers are very stressed out and with a mean attiude on a daily basis base upon the managments methods of supervision.The hardest part of this job, is the constant poor maintainence and breakdowns that can take several hours to several weeks to repair. If you breakdown from flat tire to engine problems you just as well see if a hotel or motel is close by cause repair is very slow.The most enjoyable thing is the sites and cities you go to along with the people you meet other than who work for this company."
good,"Showed for an interview they were unaware I was even booked to interview. Didn't have time for a proper interview basically told me how busy they were, how many Techs working and to ask for 80 K a year. Never ever referred or read my resume. Poor Management not enough staff & need a company HR Rep to do their hiring. When you tell someone you'll call back do it don't lie to propectives which I assume is the company way."
good,Pay isn't great but the job is easy.  No overtime pay but drop and hook is nice. Management is fine you never see them.  Hardest part of the job is staying awake it was all nights.  Best part of the job was drop and hook no touch freight.
good,Very disorganized as a typical day. I learned how to improve my management and customer service skills. Some management are not always for helping the employees in any aspect. Most co-workers are great to work with! Unreasonable expectations of some people not knowing job duties. Employee turnover ratio. Decent business hours depending on position.
good,"A typical day at work would be reviewing confidential documents and auditing customer bills of lading for revenue recognition. Processing revenue transactions for ALL business units and responding to pertinent emails from Order Management; domestic and International relating to Finished Goods Product, Oracle issues, and communicating with Internal and External customers. Assisting department manager with project goals, updating inventory spreadsheet and perform reconciliation, updating finance shipment log and assisting co-worker with any work-related issues. I've learned to keep an open-mind of what works best and monitor current processes to improve my job and ensure business commitments are met. I have a shown a great level of accomplishment and work well within a team. I encourage teamwork and maintain a postive working relationship. The hardest part of my job would be assisting other individuals while trying to meet tight deadlines for end of quarter. What I enjoy most is helping others and completing my job duties on time."
good,A good stepping stone into the transportation industry. Ryder is a great company in its own right but the pay and business practices make it difficult to enjoy
good,"I have worked here for almost 10m years and have seen the trade increase continually. I always give of my best and put myself forward for different and varied duties and responsibilities, in the hope of advancing my career. Unfortunately, the right position for me has been elusive, hence seeking a fresh challenge in a new role."
good,"if i would work there again?no, the building sucks,co workers i miss."
good,Company good to employees for many years.....Current climate of uber-micromanagement. Corporate unwillingness to hire enough manpower to get the jog done.
good,12 hr. shift
good,Company closed its doors in port Coquitlam after 8 years of service. They payed a good severance and i moved on.one of the best jobs i ever had to bad they closed the port i was at
good,No es un trabajo pesado pero no hay muy buena paga
good,"This is a great place to start but hard to keep up with other companies that are more flexible with work hours and work from home options. Also the IT aspect is always challenging when cost is over functionality, reliability, and user adoption."
good,"They want 150 characters so I’m just writing what I’m thinking out loud hahaha there is a bug on my window and I think it’s looking back at me. What a nice bug, I think it’s waving at me. Bye little bug :)"
good,"Work load was easy, managers made job very hard( no idea what's was going on at locations). 1 lazy worker that like putting his work on others, when no one was in warehouse."
good,"Job is easy and at times Is very stressful Specially if no way of communicating with inside people, equipment  is bad and if you're new even worts, too much favoritism and discrimination, there is a supervisor for everything and the harder you work the worst as an employee you are, if you lazy and milk the clock you're the best of the best !!!  keep it up lazy SOB!!!"
good,A good place to work bt I felt  like was being a manager win I was jus a team lead an I was doin manager work which I didn't mine at all bt I would like to gt manager  paid money which never happen an also the 12 hours shifts started to wear  my body down I have to little kids at home an I never had time for them because I was always tired
good,Not a good place to work if you are looking for a job that values the employees. Mechanics can never do anything right with the current management.Work is easy but too much for the amount of techs available
good,Come in have a meeting with the supervisor after split workers up to where they need to go inside the kitting cell from there u read the manifest and start working. Only downfall is sometimes the team leads set on there butt on their phone the whole 8 hr shift .
good,"Temporary Employment for the Christmas Holiday Season. It involved delivering Items for the home to the T.J. MAXX, MARSHALL'S & HOME GOODS Retail Store Chain throughout the state of NJ."
good,Very good place to work. Great employees. Very clean for a warehouse. If you have an opportunity to work there dont take it for granted. The way I did. They have very strict policies when it comes to tardiness.
good,Great benefits great pay but of course management is only interested in taking care of their group of people. I was injuired at home and not allowed to come back probably because im a liability.
good,Bad hours 3:30am to 4pm. Heavy lifting low pay. Complete chaos. Manager is completely incompetent and should not be there. Bosses will not listen to employees at all
good,"Poor don't work here they will play you to the End "
good,"Little to no training, have to work there for 2years just to get a week vacation little raises if any at all managment didn't have your back they only cared about the contract"
good,Typical day at work is fast pace and very stressful. The most important thing I learned through my career was to have patience. Hardest part of the job is having the customer on site. Most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I have gained with the people you work with daily.
good,"I filed document. Open employees records, made and posted announcement, take people picture, help with finger print, tour them in the warehouse. Help them with every need on Human resources."
good,"i had to audit the lines for all product. Management needs to work how to run a Warehouse. HR needs to figure out their rules before they enforce them.  i have been there in the building for over 8years and things were amazing then they started to go down hill from there. the last 3 years of working in that place have put myself and other in so much stress. And Management & HR forced us, even when we were sick, to work for 6days a week for 13 to 14 hr days.  the best part of working here were my co-workers...we kept each other laughing and in hopeful spirits during are long work days."
good,I worked at Ryder and I really didn't like it because the workers did not converse with you no one really likes there job management dissent really answered your questions
good,"This used to be one of the most efficient and productive warehouses I've worked in, due to frequent management level turn over and inconsistencies, it has dramatically reduced quality and productivity. Refusing to hire from within and not utilizing people in their strengths has brought moral to an all time low. Often giving personnel task that are not in their area of knowledge and experience, providing a poor quality of training, if training is done at all, overall not providing the atmosphere, communication or tools for employees to be successful at every level. "
good,"Very stressful, but expected in a JIT environment."
good,"The company has some great people in all different positions.  The company also has people that do not belong in their position and lay blame to the ones working under them."
good,Worked with very knowledgeable people in this contract position. The environment of the company was upbeat and friendly. Management was always looking for ways to improve and grow the business.
good,We typically work for or in our customers locations working long hours with little work life balance. Lot's of opportunities for advancement due to high turnover. The work environment is difficult due to customer demands which can take a toll on overall site morale. Travel for managers to open or train new site leadership happens frequently if your particular skills are in demand.
good,I would be willing to stay if there was a place for me on the account however they are cutting it to 5-6 drivers and my seniority is 8.   Unfortunately I have yet to be offered a spot on another Ryder account therefore questioning how valuable I am to the company.
good,"ryder was ok, lots of seat time in a 65mph truck and hopefully your slipseat was a decent person and took care of the truck and cleaned up after themselves."
good,"Big turn over rate, very cold, and sometimes unnecessarily mandated, good on safety, very poor on keeping stock on supplies, are responsive to your needs"
good,"I work for ryder as  a contracted worker for a larger plant. Management is there to please the customer for which we are contracted by, obviously . And I have not had the feeling that our backs were protected. It is a nice company to work for. Looks like there are a lot of opportunities for advancement, as long as you are willing to relocate."
good,Ryder was an overall not that good of a place to work at. i would not recommend the company to anyone i know nor would i work there again. the work conditions were bad but the people and shift manager was cool.
good,"You have to really be interested in not shutting a GM plant's production line down in order for you to be successful as this job/role. As an In-plant person, that has to be you and your other teammates main goal. Processes are messed up and the LLP manager only focuses on band-aiding things as opposed to creating a long-term strategy that will benefit both Ryder and General Motors."
good,"After being the most successful Dedicated account within Ryder for 2015, executive changes in June of 2016 chased off all of the management involved with the Baker Hughes account. The position I was hired for and was very successful at was eventually eliminated."
good,"Management was lack luster, expected you to do more and more everyday. Caught the manager playing games on his computer while the shop was busy or everyone else was. Manager would never take responsibility for things and never properly explain or provide leadership."
good,Make sure that you have another job to go to   Applied and have had numerous interviews.  The HR team does not have the decency to contact you with an answer.  The person that you have interviews with does not do this either.  I think this very unprofessional for a company that is one of the biggest in the world  I had worked for them years ago and at that time thought it was the best place to work.  Have to put all the blame on The HR and upper management  Stay clear of Ryder
good,You can learn a lot at Ryder. they will provide you with everything you need to start out with if your looking to work at a Warehouse. The people there are welcoming and will help you with everything you need.
good,I started as a fueler and became a technician fairly quickly but decided to step down due to unfair treatment from management. Pay is very good for work performed.
good,"Ryder has a better than average compensation package, with ten paid holidays. Vacation is comparable to most other companies. Opportunities for advancement are few and far between."
good,"It is really sad that Ryder laid off so many people but are on just about every job board as""Hiring"". What about all the laid-off people that are waiting for a call back? I would not recommend this company to anyone. They only care about the company and not the ones it takes to run it!"
good,The work place is fast paced good benifits but the pay was low. Some employees were good some was bad. The training is not very good people that work for ryder are poor trainers.
good,"Ryder is an ok company. I would have to say when I first started it seemed as if people can move around within the company very easily, but looks can be diff. As soon as I tried when it became available I was shot down so many times. Not only that Ryder do not have no training for the departments on how to do the jobs its someone showing you what to do and you learn as you go, which I don't mind that but some type of class learning can be in place for each dept."
good,"It pays well. "
good,Corporate culture can be good as well as bad. Intense and highly active engagement.Daily micro-mgmt made it difficult to conduct all work duties daily
good,Great people even though there is a lot of turn around. Managers do not communicate as well as they should. It is very fast paced and at times the employee's have pressure to get things done.
good,"A Bigger corporation is not always the best. You can advance but if your direct bosses are against you, its hard to feel productive or making you feel your work is valued."
good,"Get to work, start running some reports.   You learn how to manage your time very well.  Depending on who the manager is at the time, some like to micro manage, and some just let you work.  The culture is really people always complaining.  The hardest part about the job is keeping everyone happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly the paycheck at the end of the week."
good,I did not like the environment at this place. They worked me 7 dys a week without respecting my ability to learn. after i was schedualed as a full time reach driver they whould take my reach truck let a rookie drive it and make me walk through out the facility.
good,They call training for my position trial by fire. I was hired to be a warm body. I feel my position wasn't needed. I feel my direct coworker has been trying to get me fired from day one. I feel like the upper management has been looking for reasons to fire me for the last six months. I feel like their write up practices are beyond harsh. It takes concrete thick skin to learn and work and thrive in this environment. It is not about learning and thriving here. it is not about teamwork here. It is about who to blame for what and when.
good,"No 2 days are ever the same unless it is a winter storm.  Days go by quick especially with General Motors as your customer.  Constantly learning, hoping you are not on the wrong end of the customer's bad mood."
good,My job was to pick items from rows of stack items on to my electric pallet jack. We had to do it in a timed paste. The job was really easy and paid well.
good,Love the people and all of the things they do to make work more enjoyable. Working here is a joy on some days and you can dread it other days. It's logistics so you have to roll with the punches and come in the following day ready to tackle the madness all over again lol.
good,Place was friendly and if your looking to get into the industry you will learn a lot. Manager was somewhat quiet but overall cool.I would recommend if that's the industry you want to be in.
good,"the company is very behind the times in technology. They do not promote the most qualified. If you want to learn and grow, this may not be the best place for you."
good,plenty of work. work on every make and model. plenty of training from the multiple classes you have to take to level out. through  the day your diagnosing every vehicle. never a dull moment
good,"Its not the worst place int the world, it needs a lot of improvements but upper management is not to open to help in that department."
good,"I worked there several years. there is opportunity for advancement. However, my position was very stressful and project based. In  most cases, they promote from within."
good,"Maintenance of Fleet taken over by Ryder, Ryder Management blew a lot of smoke about training and opportunities, Had to Learn their computer system with limited/No training, Management was concerned with percentages rather then actual performance, waisted more time creating useless paper work that just got thrown away. Manager was unwilling to create an equal work environment. Management more concerned if shirt was tucked in, and didn't know anything about truck repair."
good,its a decent company to work for. wish they paid better and had more opportunity to move up. over all its an average company to work for.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to see different people in different provinces of the United States and i learnt a bit of the American accent.
good,Some shops help each other out and feel like a family.  others ur basically on your own and just feel like a job. pay is on the lower end of the scale
good,"Long days with a lot of mandated overtime, overworked good employees, few employees that would like to see positive change, management is stretched, union protects violators, very diverse employment demographic."
good,"Como qualquer empresa muita correria,agitação e alguma deficiência    na qualidade do trabalho, mas com uma boa gerencia para resolver os problemas."
good,"The company has managers that are not educated to understand or have knowledge of DOT laws."
good,"Lacks proper management, does not promote from within the company, poor attitude lingers throughout most of the staff do to lack of management."
good,"My typical day here is dealing with every aspect of the operation from the moment I walk in. Started as an order picker, was later promoted to Team Lead and now I am an Coordinator. My employer is provided a 3PL to for their distribution needs. I learned and was certified in Has Mat Planning and Export Planning. The hardest part of the job is dealing with two sets of cooperate minds."
good,My typical day at work was the same just about everyday. I would make sure all the product for the orders are there and the correct amount. I would verify product numbers to make sure they are correct and also the amount. The hardest part of my job was making sure all the employess were doing the same job and correctly. The most enjoyable part of my day was working with my co- workers as a team.
good,Company is very reactive to stock price and base most decisions on the current stock price and ignore other financial numbers that are better indicators of company performance.
good,"Was enough work for everyone at first. Then the work slowed down."
good,"Ryder corporate is a good place to work and is also family friendly. The department I work in is called Managed Maintenance Center.It's filled with insecure people that are worried that you will take their jobs. Also there is no advancement programs in place to speak of, so people don't get promoted, just loaded with ore work."
good,"A typical work day consists of diesel trucks and heat. Drivers are interesting conversationalist with life experience to present. It feels like its all about the bottom line. Co-workers are hard workers and customer oriented. The hardest part of the job is the heat working in 100 degree weather is uncomfortable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the drivers, most are sociable and willing to share their experiences."
good,At the work place i pick orders with my Rf Scanner and Loads trailers sometimes and it can be slow. But this warehouse was too relax and a lot of standing around and doing nothing
good,It was always an easy place to work everyone got alone and did what was expected and got the product packaged and on its way to the customer in a timely manner.
good,But they stick to the contracts so if Ryder has a five year contract expect to see not one penny more then what the contract is meaning no Raise
good,"Great job, very fun! However, management lacked in some areas and I rarely received the hours I was promised. All my co-workers were hard working, very entertaining individuals!"
good,"Daily routines, computer work required. Amazing learning place for multitasks."
good,"A empresa fechou as suas operações no Brasil na crise dos EUA de 2008, devido a má administração da filial brasileira."
good,"Organize boxes by waves, check systematically what needs to be picked. Pick boxes by models, then scan and label boxes. Load onto a trailer or pallet for ups and fedex."
good,load unload the coworkers were great people to work with hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
good,work load varies. very hard to plan a budget because paycheck is never the same.
good,Company let me go because got sick and it was a safety issue on the other hand a manager told me he was going to make sure he cause problems for me
good,I really enjoyed working with some of the best folks in the business at Ryder. The hard part was the continual revolving door of team members.The customer normally has to accept how Ryder will implement the solution not what the client thinks is the solution.
good,"Incentified program makes for a decent paycheck. However a promotion means you will  make alot less money, so your supervisors are poor workers who were promoted out of neccesity.  When you want to work harder than your supervisor it can create  a problem. Overall a decent place if you can put up with a bunch of people who make the job harder than it needs to be."
good,Great Field staff that work hard to service customer. Great team environment.
good,"my experience was bittersweet as a CDL a class driverworking through a staffing agency for almost 3 months without making the slightest of mistakes,I showed them, I thought, professionalism dependability efficiency and loyalty, they decided to hire me away from the staffing agency,last Friday I took my DOT physical and drug screen for the position and as my luck would have it while setting up to back in and make a deliverymy trailer rubbed A wooden light pole on the right sideshowing about an 8 to 10 inch rub mark or scrape on the rail of the trailer. so I thought... should I be truthful about it and admit to what I did damaging the equipment even ever so slight as it was? Or do I tell a big whopping lielike I stopped at a truck stop to use the bathroom and when I came back outside someone had scraped into the side of my trailer! so I went with the truth and I owned up and admitted that I had made my first mistake. Ryders employment offer to me was then removedbut they went ahead and used me a few more days throughout the rest of the week until they found their candidate BIG. big lesson learned for me...TELL THE LIE."
good,"My first IT position out of school. Nice benefits and good atmosphere, but company has a very high turn-over ratio."
good,I put my all into Ryder and they turned around and bit my hand off.  The manager I was working for is less than the one who hired me.  I will never work for Ryder Corporation again.
good,Overall a great place to be and the company is great. Fun also but serious business as well as the people working for the company. 
good,"it was a good place to work when i first started there,now i wouldn't even recommend it to anyone looking,not even my worst enemy.i went from having a personal life to ryder becoming my life working 50-55 hours a week (including weekends for on-call) and still being pushed to do more.all management ever cares about are their bonuses all the while bringing shop morale down.there's hardly any of the correct or correctly working tools in the shop,and when you bring it to their attention they don't want to spend the money.they'll send just about all their tech's on road calls,sometimes up to two hours away,and then come down on them because the scheduled job for them in the shop isn't finished.most of the time the manager's are worried about their pm currentcy,but yet they let tech's take 3-4 days to complete a pm service,all the while trying to make excuses to the customer and upper management as to why the service isn't done yet.if i could find another shop to work i would leave without any regret's and never look back."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers but had a tough time getting along with my manager.
good,working at this company started out to be ok then as a couple years go by instead of things getting better they got worst there was nothing to look forward toward
good,"stagging product,opening totes, crushing product with fork truck, putting up tote on hopper."
good,The hardest part of the job is the limited communication from Headquarters and support. There was a good infrastructure of support amongst the field finance team - which no longer exists
good,A place to start off if coming out of high school. Constant change of staff.
good,a very productive place and consant working and very long hours of heavy lifting.
good,"I enjoyed my work with rider, but the hours eliminated any prospect of a social life. I'm only putting this in because it's required. Here comes 150.."
good,Easy job. kept me busy. Place was very clean. 12hrs a day= good $. Work 6dys a week was interfering with other appointments. System was frustrating when it froze or something wasnt in the system. Lenient tho. They work with you. Super boring w/o music.
good,Depending on which team you are hired for. Your job may be relatively stress free or will turn your hair grey overnight. The jobs in management are salaried and lots of after hours responsibility that greatly affects your work life balance.
good,"Leadership are micro managers and control freaks, do not trust their employees but rather question their knowledge daily.  You have to be in with the groupies to be considered for other roles."
good,The work to pay ratio is well worth it. I wouldnt work here if you are looking for family time. They mandate working people upwards of 55 hours a week. The management when I worked there was uncaring and I saw people get fired in absurd and demeaning ways.
good,"Receive all in bound orders verifying and reconciling of any discrepancies on all P.O.s"
good,position required phone time but missed the point that times are changing and many people don't have time to talk especially is they are a small business. Emails are valuable way to communicate too and sometimes better for the customer.
good,Not  good company is just out dated with advancement and salary rates.  If you are looking to advance this is not the right company to work for. Upside to that is that the benefits are OK.
good,It was unsafe to work there. People would go off on you and make your job hard for nothing. Managers did not do the job when they needed it and people were always not on time for work so you would have to do it.
good,"I would often request development plans or guidance to better myself and further my career but would not receive it. They never provided feedback but would often point out issues or concerns they had with employee performance but would not offer any advice for improvement. Pretty much would go ""you did this wrong"" but would not provide you the correct way to perform the duty. They would continue with other issues instead of guidance."
good,"Ryder is a great place to work if you are willing to relocate and have them place you where they want you. At times, the work day can be extremely stressful and you may be expected to answer your phone at any time during the night or your days off. Promotions seem hard to get as well."
good,I’m on a dedicated account and they just treat you like a child. So much micro managing going on. It’s also very demanding and taxing on the body. They say “No Touch” but no way can you get this job done without touching something.
good,Company offers great benefits if you can hold on long enough for shift availability. There were some major inconsistencies in management and protocol per location.
good,"having to apologize to a customer for an ongoing issue known by the company is absurd. sending service to repair a truck is pretty much common sense, having to jump through hurdles just come up with the same resolution is kind of senseless ,especially since the the goal is to get unit back up on the road"
good,"If Ryder had managment that cared about the job. And others that actually knows what's going on the place would be a great place to be. They never listen to the warehouse associates, the ones that actually does the work and who knows what's going on."
good,I was started off as a lease employee and promised to be hired on several times over my year with Ryder but it never happened. Only to find out that now i am being released from my position here because its not in the budget to have so many office employees
good,"Always felt like my job was at risk, and had to fight to get a promotion and when a promotion was offered it was at a decreased pay. The benefits were the only positive."
good,"I worked at Ryder in Lichfield last year and hated every minute of it. The manager is not a nice person, although they try and act like it on the surface of things and has even drove people to leave because they’re impossible to work with. "
good,"No bay space "
good,Work load was good but I felt there was lack of leadership from all employees. The culture was not good at being proactive. More of a reactive and blame game.
good,management refuses to get the tools to get the job done constantly switching jobs no parts to get the job done friendly co workers job training only approved by management
good,"Not a career-worthy place, but not bad. Take all the training you can get while you're there and be ready to move on when the time comes."
good,beaucoup de pression à trop accomplir avec peu de mains d'oeuvre.
good,"Compensation is fair however there is a culture of ""do it because I said so or else"". If you aren't careful and don't manage towards it, there is no work/life balance. Ryder is a great company overall, I feel I may just be on the wrong team at this point."
good,"overall not too bad the down sides are a LOT of paperwork and procedures, its as bad as government, EVERYTHING has to be accounted for via paperwork or coded and they are way overboard ridiculous with safety rules as well but bad conditions or people and pay is ok"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing employee's succeed. Being able to see talent and their determination to their job performance is rewarding.
good,I worked at several locations for Ryder over the past near 40 years. All locations gave me opportunities to grow in some way. I have been able to do work that I enjoyed and provide for my family.
good,Third part logistics for AT&T. Scan equipment to techs in morning and maintain two small warehouse for minor material.Technology constantly changing. Fiber is the new wave. Materials change constantly. You learn as you go. Little to no training. Just safety meetings nothing related to equipment or materials. Maintain constant inventory on equipment. Keep up with minor materials as needed.
good,"I really enjoyed my job, but the management team and HR was very deceiving.  They always played favorites and didn't follow their own rules and regulations.  They would break every rule and regulation to cut corners and get their way or it was no way at all."
good,"45 hours work in very sad looking location"
good,Typical Call Center environment. Not many internal departments and advancement is limited only by the lack of positions upwards or laterally. The best opportunities for advancement is by applying for positions outside of the SSC often requiring relocation.
good,"The team/department you work with really makes or breaks your experience. Overall, as a company, Ryder is very very old fashioned. The pay is okay unless you are Mgr level or above. A lot of departments are extremely understaffed due to layoffs. Many people get hired or promoted due to favoritism and its very obvious. I wish they were a bit more flexible when it comes to working from home/flex time. Many positions you are able to work remotely but just not allowed unless you call in sick."
good,Fast paced environment and good co-workers. They will put to much work on you to the point of overloading you to save the company money. Most people here earn their money.
good,It was a ok job. With hard working management. Benefits were ok but not great. Seemed like a dead end job with little room for advancement. Would not return.
good,"It was an okay place to work. It all depends on where you were positioned and on what shift. Turnaround was high, and if you could stick it out, it wasn't bad"
good,Very high turnover rate not ideal place to work for most people more of one sided management towards certain people in company very diverse in people for most part
good,No room for improvement for veteren employers. Lack of communications between management Turn over rate is extremely high. Very busy during the busy season
good,"They give you the basics of what you need to learn in order to work on the units. There is OEM based on-line training, but its on your own time and affects your advancement. Ryder has good insurance coverage and stock options. The pay scale varies by shop and region. Ryder is a multi- legged company and parts of the company operate with no thought into how it affects the ground level i.e. technicians. They constantly change protocol to keep their profits right and in turn the shops operate with bare minimal..even though they are ""THE TOP IN THE INDUSTRY""."
good,"If you want to rise in the ranks, be prepared to give up a big chunk of your personal life.  Ryder way is to over work employees and the scratch heads when things aren’t perfect."
good,"Fun, but very stressful.  I am on call 24/7 and even when on vacation I have to work.  Work life balance is not very good.  Room for advancement if willing to relocate."
good,"Company operated in a very considerate and professional manner. Worked well with it's employees, and allowed flexibility as much as possible, with it's employees personal affairs."
good,I work second shift and we are told constantly the we need to improve when we already produce more than 2 other shifts we do over time every week Monday- Saturday it seems like people leave faster than they are trained
good,"A poorly understood ""Lean Culture"" leads to an unbalanced workload for the on-site management, leading to high turnover and burnout. "
good,The previous manager of the transportation department was amazing. The position is very fast paced and strategic. There are no room for errors. I did enjoy talking to the many different people each day.
good,"short breaks"
good,Put you on a dedicated account but if that account has no work they wont let you go haul a load on a different account so you can make money. Because then your not available for your account if your gone on another one. So if no work they just sit you.
good,"Stressful "
good,washing fueling changing tires and what I'm asked to do take out trash sweep mope   my boss is good. show up do your job and go home.changing tires. washing truck meeting customers
good,I would recommend this job to single people with no kids because you won't have time for them if you work there. The pay is great and so are the benefits but the draw back is you'll basically be working 6 to 7 days a week unless you get approved for vacation.
good,"Working 6 days a week is not for me. All new employees will be expected to work midnights. Additionally you will be required  to work 6 days a week from September to April, good luck with that."
good,"Fast paced, high stress environment. Didn't feel like a valued employee. Too many demands of working overtime. Management needs improvement, as well as working to improve overall moral of employees."
good,"it was so so not bad, the training was sub par and the trainers kept playing around too much and they also bullied alot of us. that wasnt good to start with"
good,"No room for growth. My position as an active employee involves responsibility, but, not working with others as a team member. After working here for almost a year, I've been given no encouragement to achieve advancement and no opportunity to help achieve growth for the company. Among the multiple locations where I am sent to complete the daily tasks, there is a garage where I have no access to the restroom and I am required to be there for several hours a day."
good,Ryder is a good up and coming company in the contract industry. there are pros and cons to this company. they do have a high turnover ratio largely due to individual work ethic and management.
good,"Great work, some hard working people.  Management shows favoritism to some bad employees.  Some managers are close friends with employees, some managers are parents of subordinate managers. Confidentiality is non existent."
good,"Lots of good ideas that got picked up somewhere, but in most cases, the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. Lots of shops, poor service, even if you go out of your way to make it easy. Lots of fuel station on those shop premises, that aren't available 24/7. Degrading equipment."
good,ryder was an ok job but i wouldnt reccomend them to anyone looking for long time work the pay wasnt great sometimes we would sent home early with no chances for making up for lost hours
good,"Pros: Good company to work for. Decent skills are learned. "
good,"The job was enjoyable, minus management. The drivers do unnecessary stuff on the job like taking test after work (after working 10 plus hours), ""mandatory"" meetings on Saturdays (mandatory didn't apply to all drivers), and being harassed constantly about minor issues. There was no official start time for the work day but management made it impossible for drivers to effectively manage time. After three years I did not receive a raise and was encouraged to quit when I requested a raise. There is a culture of lying, deceit, intimidation and covering yourself, not doing what is best for the employees."
good,"I fairly enjoyed working for them. As a yard supervisor, I took pride in what I did: motion semi-trucks to their docks, had nice conversations with truck drivers, and communicated via walkie talkie to the supervisors regarding incoming trailers carrying equipment. The managers were friendly and it was a calm work atmosphere."
good,Need improved communication among employees. Need newer systems. people are nice to work with. work life balance was good. benefits not that great. no set procedures in place in accounting/finance department.
good,The main thing on the road is safety and staying focus is vital to getting back home.  The employees at the stores in which I deliver are overall friendly.  I've learned how to stay calm and safe through any situation.
good,"Manage 25 employees in a very fast paced and heavy volume location."
good,was a good place for learning the trade. pay advancment did not match with my knowledge advancement. i learned a lot here had some really good mentors. but as my knowledge increased my pay did not.
good,"Not the best company to work for but the pay and environment is good and healthy."
good,"When you arrive at work, you use your key card to get through the doors, then clock in and check-in. When your shift starts at 6 a.m. then you should be on the floor and ready to perform repetitive tasks; which uses Pringles. Palatalizing, building displays, taping boxes, or stacking chips are just some of the tasks that are required. Management lacks proper communication with one another and do not value their employees, nevertheless there are some in lower management that actually value their employee and management relationships. Management cannot distinguish employees a part. My co-workers are lively and like to work together to achieve the ultimate goal of completion of tasks. The hardest part of the job is the extreme heat conditions with a break every two hours, with there being two ten minute breaks and one thirty minute lunch break. There is no issue with the lunch break, but only ten minutes when it is extremely hot; which includes the time you walk off of the floor, seems absurd. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees who know how to enjoy themselves; despite their day and they actually care about people that they are just being acquainted with. Overall I believe that the company could use more effective communication skills among hierarchy, and should never devalue employees. They need to understand that their company is their resource and it costs them more money to fire and rehire, than to hire and work with employees."
good,Ryder is a great company to work for but due to the financial flux within the Chicagoland area they are cutting cost's and making it difficult to help the retail customers
good,The overall company is a great company. They have small pockets of upper management that have an agenda of only promoting vervain employees. Co-workers are great and helpful with problem solving.
good,This company has so many locations and divisions that you can virtually do anything you want somewhere in the USA.  Plan your future with this company!
good,"Pay started out bad, got better, lost my pay raise to keep the job, management is weak, way too many changes to adapt to even though I spent time in military."
good,"I started working here nearly 8 years ago and only stayed because I saw the opportunity to advance and get experience I needed for a better job elsewhere."
good,"receive skids from different companies that will get ship the same day to customers, coworkers are great, very busy environment with a lot of learning daily."
good,love my job sadly management isn't where it should be and doesn't give the opportunity to move up within the company. very disappointed.
good,not the most Professional job i have ever had but i had a great experience working with inmates and the other co workers around me
good,"Go in and open up and get to answering phone calls and booking loads or finding loads for company trucks.Patience and Information on the trucking business. Management was alright and The Co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the day was when we were slow. The Most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say the customers and Trucking Brokers, Brick Company Employees and i had made Friendships."
good,"Pros"
good,Not a bad place to work for a first job. Your co workers are fun to be around. The management is ok but not the greatest. If you don't mind the cold it is not a bad place.
good,"My typical day at work involves managing truck inventory to ensure my location's trucks are being utilized, maintained and profitable. I also assist with customer fleet needs and solicit new business. I keep track of all accident damage and repair, unused inventory, and "
good,"Overall, not a terrible company to work for. Laid back and low expectations seem to be prevalent. People pick up and leave very frequently, leading to empty promises on behalf of management in an effort to retain employees"
good,Ryder is a great company to work for.  They just need to review their salary against other companies and allow room for growth for high performing employees.
good,"Started here in 2006 and have been promoted twice. I work hard and enjoy the challenges. In a typical day myself and team will schedule and coordinate pick up and delivery of over 150 shipments. Everything ships from one central location to over 800 destinations throughout the continental US, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Muti-tasking is a must. I am learning to better manage my time and develop processes that allow me to get more done since the LEAN culture has been implemented. "
good,Multi brand focus with a variety of distribution channels.  High degree of vendor contact.
good,"the workers as a group tried to make the job more fun and productive,   by sharing with the workers who were new so that the management wouldn't get upset when things didn't move as fast as they thought it should.  Management couldn't fix problems with orders or loads so we relied on each other,  most of the time the work environment was hostile and stressful. Senior Supervisors who couldn't tell or help some one new because they didn't know how to load a trailer."
good,"Ryder Integrated Logistics  -  Received company proprietary training in the fields of logistics and management development.  Initially worked with the “Bell South” account.  Location received recognition for “above and beyond service” during Hurricane Georges.   Promoted from assistant manager to location manager at Mayfair Windows account.  Managed long haul drivers and decreased customer’s cost through increased backhaul revenue.  Transferred to “Save-A-Lot” account where I received experience in refrigerated trailers.  Supervised 18 employees.  Responsible for all location HR, A/R, A/P, Safety, and equipment maintenance location functions."
good,"Disappointed with level of unprofessional management style of one ""director"" in particular. They played favorites, treated majority of employees with little respect, and micro-managed just about everything to the point that productivity, in some areas, was greatly reduced. Not an ideal location to work unless you like being brow-beaten. When this was raised to next level management a blind eye was turned to the issue which made me realize this was not a good environment to pursue a career. I would consider working at other Ryder locations but never again at this particular location."
good,a very good place to work and a place that I love to work I was naver late or missed a day of work and work as much overtime as need
good,This position is a third shift position that does not allow for a normal home life nor sleep pattern.
good,"Fairly simple logistical operation. Learned the ends and outs of tracking materials from large distribution centers to small businesses. Management was great; even though some managers micro-managed and panic at every situation that arose. Never allowed team members to deal with the issues. The hardest part of the job was the micro-managing, and the inability to handle situation without manager help. The most enjoyable part was just the team building experience"
good,"work varies day to day, never a shortage but would like to be compensated for work performed. I like to think I learn something new everyday.management is very laxed, little accountability and poor follow up to concerns.My cow-workers are great, we all get along and work well as a team. the hardest thing for me is the under compensation. the best part of my days at work are interacting with my co-workers"
good,Everyday is a new challenge which makes it an interesting and fast paced jod.
good,"I loaded and unloaded trucks everyday."
good,Overall was a very positive experience where I learned to manage multiple tasks at once and do so in an organized manner.  Had to account for a fleet of around 100 trucks and keep all of our customers satisfied on a daily basis.  Also had to manage the preventative maintenance on the trucks and communicate daily with our shop management about the status of certain units needing mechanical repairs.  Cold and warm called customers daily as well and provided leads to our sales manager.  Overall I learned a lot and gained invaluable experience that I know will help immensely in my next position.
good,"not the greatest job, but it was a great starter job. i do not recommend this job for people looking to move forward."
good,"Enjoyed work place, people and most of all the customers I worked with on a daily basis.  However, my division re-located to Novi, Michigan and I was unable to transfer due to family commitments"
good,"I worked with really caring people,i had good days and bad ,really not a lot of team work"
good,"Very fast paced and challenging environment, professionally speaking. Ability to troubleshoot is tested at all times. Good hands-on automotive warehousing and inventory control for both good and not so good practices (to learn from). Definitely the real deal on what is it to be a 3PL, unlike other companies that own/run their own logistics."
good,"It's never the same which is not bad keeping variety in your life. Ryder has solid processes and is always creating new or improving an old process, or even a single point lesson for training. I can say there are quite a few people within the organization i respect and have grown with in my ventures. Then there are the ones i just can't figure how they got where they are, or how they actually keep there jobs. The shop floor is a mix of good and bad but is always going to be that way with the size of the company. The hardest part of my job is acccepting the fact i am doing someone else's job with regularity. Instead of coaching and mentoring it is slowing becoming common for other managers not make decisions for themselves."
good,No support from upper management
good,"Limited innnovation, disjointed organizational structure, product quality declining"
good,My compony is gong through a transition period where culture and production goals are still being determined. Management is knowlegeable and encouraging. Personal goals and opportunities are limited to upcoming tansitions.
good,"It was fine. Good learning experience. Mostly data entry, material movement and management, and monitoring status of parts and shipments. Good starting point."
good,This location the management only hire people from the same college they attended and those are the same people that get promoted . The other office workers and sanitation are awsome and the pepsi clients
good,"At this job I have learned a lot through experience. I also enjoy working with most of my coworkers."
good,"Management are terrible, would not recommend it for anyone unless your desperate, Long hours (40 hours), under valued, not appreciated, location out the way, overall treated with disrespect."
good,"Ryder had just restructured the IT PMs into a PMO business structure aligned under the IT Director.  All PMs were reassigned and new business practices were being developed and implemented.  The current projects remained under the assigned PM but new projects were assigned based on timing and availability.  "
good,"Somewhat dysfunctional office.  Told different ways to do things by different people.  While they preached safety I did not feel it was a safe working environment by the end of my tenure.  At the end of the day there was good and bad there.  I received zero actual training in 2 years which I feel put me at a disadvantage.  Tough to leave as the pay was good, but started hating to go to work."
good,Over the past several month we have had to watch our pay checks due to manager changes and new contracts nobody can figure out. Have to file paper work to correct these issues to get your full pay.
good,"After working at this company for four years, I learned much about how the company works. Most times I hear the supervisors care about the employees but all they care for is production and money. In my department only a few get hired but everyone else is permanent temp until the annual layoff that last from 2 weeks to a month. That's why I like to find a job to better myself rather than stay in this warehouse where I hardly go anywhere."
good,Pretty good very busy people are somewhat good to work with but overall had a good experience learning new and exciting job features all the management that I worked with helped me in some way to excel in my goal to achieve every day
good,A good place to work just low salary at the time 10.00 Per hour with yearly raises annually. Salary is dependant on your attendance with good attendance you might get 25 cents for that year. With bad you might get nothing. Overall it was an ok place to work.
good,Was an easy job with reasonable co-workers.The management was nice but my only complaint is the long hours.I think it was an okay start point but not for me due to being so far out.
good,Typical day was waiting for your work order or continuing on the one you left off on the day before. Learned a lot from different mechanics there about things I didn't know as far as having to diagnose or quicker ways to solve the problem. Management there was okay but not the best. Culture there was great. Hardest part was just trying to get through the day without being called on for another job while you where working on one. I mostly enjoyed interacting with my work mates and learning from them.
good,"Safety first. Easy driving the forklifts. I enjoy learning new things there. Fast pace. Not a hard job "
good,Ryder is a good place to start off at I learned alot in the time I worked here but after so long you run to the end of the rope and there isnt much to look forward to. I think there is a lack of organization and a lack of discipline.
good,The president of the company petros was amazing. Anything i needed he always helped but any other manager below him was horrible. They always passed the buck.
good,"parts guys are slow to do anything because they're always stuck on the phone. Waiting around 1.5-2.5 hours per shift small shop, 10 techs for 8 bays, no outside work allowed"
good,"A great place to gain experience but then move on. Great colleagues. Good perks."
good,"Ryder from the outside is a great company, but if you are an employee HR is of no help. They are strict with safety, and for good reason. If you plan on keeping your head down and working go for it."
good,The department that i work in at Ryder has low morale and the employes are not treated well. Our entire department is trying to either go to a new department or to a new company as a whole. Our manager does not want you to advance and will hold you back for her gain.
good,-Start from lower level position.  Typically picking orders by hand.  After demonstrating proficiency you may be trained on forklift equipment and reach trucks.
good,"low salary too much pressure stressful, paid break, good benefit, Sometime overtime Sometime the.The job is temporary 401k health care life insurance  sometime paid bonus"
good,"Pick up truck at Ryder yard, drive to warhouse and hok up 1 or 2 trailers.  take to assigned location, swap trailers and return.  A couple of overnights a week"
good,"Family like atmosphere with some informal meetings, every month bdays get celebrated, but the other hand...we weren't using our heads much...``just get the job done and no room for much thinking``"
good,If you have questions don't bother to ask. You will be made fun of and the others team up to make you fill like you dont belong here. I wouldn't mind finding another job.
good,They promise all kinds of stuff never do anything they say. They took our incentive away and gave us a dollar raise and expected more from you then they deserve. The management trying to save money by cutting incentive. This place does not care about you or your family. All they want is to push you around
good,"if you yearn for the days of being back at school, this is the place to be , constantly being watched and monitored. don't expect to be left to use your own initiative . and health and safety is well over the top. after all nobody goes to work to injure themselves. great bunch of lads on the workshop floor, but not so good the higher up the ladder . the glory days are over i'm afraid. wages are about average and pension is very good"
good,Ryder provided an income for me at a time when I could not find a teaching position because I had arrived in the state too late in the summer.  It was steady work.
good,"no comment, just not the best place to work if you want to be able to advance in your career, make promises that they have a hard time keeping and sticking to."
good,Too much stress on fleet maintenance management team with minimal compensation for the work performed. Was a tech there and that was fine. Wanted to move forward in my career and regretted it.
good,typical day was come to work and rush through assigned task and still have 4 hours left to go. i'd get yelled at for trying to help other to stay busy. otherwise i'd end up wait for a call or email to go find a count or mip miin on a part.
good,Ryder was an organization that provided great on the job learning.  It was long hours at times and can be stressful based upon length of contract for the services they provide
good,"Ryder was my 1st Logistics Job which taught the Importance of Communications of Logistics to and from the Consignee.  Although the Room for Advancement was very little, the Company still provided a Great Atmosphere to work."
good,One thing Ryder management should do is check that some employees actually work.  There was a supervisor that did nothing but take smoke breaks and go for walks to make themselves look busy then I get laid off over that person all because they had been there longer.
good,Seems like t.v. losing a lot more stores and hardly gaining new ones.Worried pay and future of t.v.. Recently dropped to four days with possible 5th day. 4 days pay not enough for family.
good,Supervisor position ran day to day operations. Lack of info from managers left in dark to figure out operation needs. criticized for not running the right way because they lack getting info on changes fast enough.
good,"Not a fair working environment, answers two questions are barely ever answered honestly! The equipment was new and up-to-date and always taken care of."
good,"Ok place to work, nice people, good cause.  A lot of freedom to do your job as you think and to hire your own staff.  Nice environment and pay not too bad at all."
good,"Ryder is a really good place to work, however; room for advancement is pretty narrow and the pay scale for experience is on the low end. I would recommend anyone to work here to get your foot in the door"
good,"Management doesn't believe in positive reinforcements, thus you'll never get a thank you or encouragement for a job well done.  Almost all suggestions from hourly employees has never been taken seriously.  Favoritism runs the house, i.e.  do your job well you,ll be given more responsibility with no advance in pay and more pressure to perform and a larger work load."
good,"A typical day at Ryder is fast paced, I have had a lot of training as a Technician. The hardest part of the job is to be completely dedicated to the company and perform many job functions within, and not being compensated."
good,"my experience wasn't completely terrible, just like working inside of any warehouse you deal with a lot of people. If you like working indepently this is definitely a nice place to do so. On the upside I got hit and knocked over with a hilo, harassed about everyday, my keys and badge went missing at the same time for a week, and if you are ever put on restrictions be aware of every small detail and rights, they love to keep their money anyway possible."
good,"review all material discrepancies "
good,It is something temporary and I do love my management team I am looking for something with a little more competitive pay and advancement opportunities.
good,"Position was pleasant.  Very clean and organized.  I got along with everybody I worked with.  Pay wasn't great, but manageable.  I could've seen myself working there longer if they hadn't shut down."
good,great people to work with. shop is clean but a little outdated. very busy shop. always work to do. only cons are that management is constantly down your throat to get the job completed as fast as possible.
good,Commercial drivers who reported to me were professionals of the highest order. They were always willing to support their team mates and open to changes in their schedules.
good,It only took me a 6 months to move up within the company ranks from my hire date and Ryder will hire only within the organization. Also the co-workers and customer you meet will leave ever lasting memories
good,Your experience with Ryder depends largely on the account you work on .  Some customers can be high maintenance and difficult to work with.
good,Ryder was the bed the job i ever had. Just management and coperate lied to us alot. About everything and didn't fight for our jobs how.They should've.
good,"No employer is better that its local management.  Good company with decent benefits.  Very poor choices in local leadership.  My local experience (current shop location) is not a good one.  Too many employees with a poor work ethic, and a manager that thinks that's OK.  Company practices and protocol are not being followed, and employees are reprimanded for trying to.  It's tough to do a good job in spite of leadership.  Employees are handicapped by a terrible computer system!"
good,"Arranging breakdown cover, recovery, repair, replacement of a customer's vehicle."
good,"Company reaches far, but not very deep. Management is meeting crazy, vice boots on the ground."
good,"Management is focused on one thing. $$$$$"
good,"Some days it good and some are bad, especially on busy days where people are just rushing through not looking where there going on the fork truck, Working there sometimes can be depressing, I witness this everyday as walking through the doors and I can just feel the lost hopes an dreams. It's hard to balance school and work life, because someone with a higher seniority than me move me from one shift to another. it happen to me last year and I had to drop my classes."
good,fácil pero todo el día se estaba atenuado por que no dejaban acabar una tarea cuando te ponían otra sin abre acabado la anterrior.
good,Unload and load trucks according to employers needs. Put away or pull full skid and carry with side by side forklift. Also worked with roll back racks.
good,"Pick, receive, and pack by yourself, with others, doesn't matter this place had consistency."
good,"Working for Ryder I have learned many areas of logistic,Logistic Liaison Launching, Servicing customer within there establishment  as a 2nd party company."
good,"Ryder is a good company, however they do not pay the same as the market, especially for loyal employees."
good,"Very hot during summer and cold during winter. boxing and packing co-worker was fine to work with. Cleaned, this is stupid to fill out"
good,Seems like there was someone getting hired and fired everyday there for no good reason. Seems like they had a new manager every week and they were very unorganized. A typical day at work almost always consist of a machine problem. I learned to move fast or be prepared to be fired. My co workers would not have been my first choice in people to hang around with. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with unreasonable working conditions. I did not enjoy working at Ryder.
good,"Each day began with a meeting with manager on floor.  Daily assignments were given out at that time as well.  Completed said duties such as loading, unloading and storing product to appropriate area."
good,First and Second shift Driving.  Most employees are friendly.  Equipment was not very well maintained.  Supervisor was very personable.
good,"Where I was, truck service island attendant. Even when I was doing the work of up to three people. I was loved by the techs because I kept them off the island. The customers loved me because I provided really good service. The only ones whom didn't approve of my work was the management. My supervisor at the time rode me like his personal mule. The shop manager couldn't be bothered. The upper (offsite) manager wanted more out of less. It's not about how many approve. It's about who approves."
good,"A great company to work, as long as you don't have a significant other. Or family. You can almost guarantee a fairly good income by the hours that you will work. The duties are no more then any other truck driving job. Ryder, goes by time tables. The company really tries to go by these times, the suppliers do not."
good,Get put in teams and get assigned  a job. Learned how to use a box cutter correctly and about PPA.Could have been manage better. Co-worker was alright.
good,"i work on all types of vehicles light to heavy duty. You gain your knowledge from senior techs there. This place is a stepping stone for working else where, after enough experience with the company. No growth or expansion available,no overtime,no raises, work constantly above your pay grade without compensation or hope of advancing. Best part of job is u learn new things everyday."
good,"I valued the people I have met at the organization. However, the company is not consistent with pay and office workers. I appreciate the training and the job opportunity."
good,"Hard to keep a good family life for the hours you have to work, not knowing how long each day will be, co-workers were a good group of guys and girls, but well paid and understanding for time off."
good,"I worked with Ryder first as a Temp then was hired on and promoted to a lead position.  I worked with the Quality team.  I noticed during my tenure at Ryder the members of the leadership team all exhibited great self-confidence.  It allowed them to allow team members at all levels to be the mechanism of change.  "
good,Fun team building activities. Management that is accessible. they have the ability to move you without much notice which is not cool. In 2 years I had 5 different managers.
good,overloaded work shifts with unrealalistic goals. management was over bearing. and created alot of stress in work place. co workers were great.
good,"A typical day at Ryder involved five/eight to 10 hour days, working in a non-climate controlled, dust laiden warehouse. "
good,"i have learned in this role about Dispatch, Order management and Routing routes for drivers for next day."
good,"To many Chiefs and not enough Indians, everyone wants to be the boss but no one wants to accept the responsibilities"
good,"I plan and route all the trucks, keep track of trailer, and tracker repairs, DOT files, KPI, Payroll"
good,Ryder was an excellent paying company.  Their benefits package was wonderful.  However the jobs are very demanding and the management is not effective.
good,"Flexible work hours."
good,"I enjoy working with others, and having fullfilled my job duty's."
good,"newer facility. newer equipment not user friendly, not ergonomic. poor warehouse management presents. management stayed in the office and did email. coordinators not familiar with the job specs their trying to coordinate. Hourly wages have been capped for 3 years."
good,Ryder was not what I expected once they purchased the company I had been working for.
good,I worked here and I worked hard everyday. I enjoyed the packing aspect.
good,"A good company to work for; however, they are more concerned about their name rather than the employees who work there"
good,"Responsibilities include equipment, drivers, and route optimization. Developing new lanes and control cost for new profitable markets. I controlled driver’s hours of operation and route optimization in order to reduce overtime to benchmark at under 10% or below. I assisted drivers in transportation and processes within United Stationers company policies. I was reasonable for weekly payroll and local HR. Handled yard moves and if there was extra loads, the customer requested as a priority I would haul them. If a driver was out on vacation or sick day and we could not get anyone to cover route, I would haul that load myself."
good,"Very fast paced work environment that I do enjoy,"
good,It's a company that will replace you and get someone else. They are all talk and i am not very impressed with Ryder. Other employees feel the same way as i do
good,"The daily work day at Ryder was exciting, there was always something different to do either the orders or equipment they placed us on the work day with Ryder consisted of filling orders and keeping the work place safe."
good,The co-workers at ryder are vey close and work very close together. The management is a different entity. They tend to take their frustrations out on the employees. The job stresses good quality work but want their quantity high as well. This is a smart thing to do but requires management to not talk to their employees like children
good,busy workday caused by lack of foresight by management.
good,Call center logistics. Good environment for me while completing my degree in night school
good,"way to much management and always changing policies and procedures. Ryder will jump all over you for not preforming a task, or following procedures, but when you need them to do something for you it takes forever to get a response. If you even get one at all."
good,"A good entry level job after college grad to do for 2 years or less, but not a career. In the 3PL business, there is a lot of instability as accounts come and go on a yearly basis."
good,"nice place to work,only a little hectic all the time. people were good, some of the work repeditive"
good,Very good company to work and very combined to stay because the place is close to my home especial to drive on wintertime and the people are very friendly.
good,"Ryder's future is very uncertain.  They provide fleets to major retailers and corporations whose products/stores are struggling or closing.  They have had a huge class action lawsuit filed against them for racial discrimination."
good,On a daily basis the working environment consist of manuavering your forklift picking orders from a manifest. Through the course of the day loading the product for shipment and unloading product for replenishment.
good,"Good company to work for of course could be better in some areas pay,  work, people."
good,"A Typical day at work was come in grab your assigned truck ,hook up, do a pre-trip , do paper work ,continue to your stores for delivery, drive back to yard . inhook turn paperwork in. i am knowledgeable with people net and geo -tab for log book"
good,IT'S A JOB .......Like everything in the new corporate World the managers are under the Sims system meaning they need to get the most out of their employees will tell you are captain of the ship But having a webcam pointed at your face while driving is definitely a distraction and tells me BIG corporate really doesn't Trust you For the most part they will leave you alone occasionally they'll get a new manager and he'll go into his SIMS workbook and try something New on you.....you have to be there many of years to get advanced .....you can't make this stuff up it's a job HOPE this helped....Keep your Wits about you and you'll be okay Until a better JOB comes along
good,Ryder is a good place to work. They offer good benefits and competitive pay. Reasonable management and make sure that you have a good work/life balance.
good,Good company they pay high rate for there mechanics. Highly recommend this company to anyone just starting off or already experienced.................
good,"picked orders using a cherry picker, used rf scanner to pick the orders, was a fast pace work space and the managers payed attention to your productivity numbers."
good,I help build a 65 story high rise apartment building this included storefront. I was in charge of the interior program. took the job through finily TCO
good,Nice place to obtain shipping and receiving experience in this field today could be fun but busy at the same time better system this place could be around for a long time
good,"First off, the terminal manager in Rochelle, Il is one of the most honest, helpful and respectful people I have dealt with in my employment history."
good,Working at Ryder was somewhat fast paced and easy to get along with other employees. They had a lunch room for breaks and vending machines to get a soda and chips.
good,Ryder is a great company to work for I’m sorry I pointed out but I had too much family problems going on Ryder sends you to other locations to help out and they pay you well for doing it
good,"Great place, to much too many hours of work, fast place and have a easy access to get to"
good,"Very stressful environment, give you too many stops to do with impossible times to complete them. Tell management about safety issues and was told ""Just do it"".Favoritism for certain drivers, while other drivers would have to pick up the slack and get double to triple the workload. Very unsafe work environment."
good,"Renuevan contrato cada mes, lo complicado es obtener la planta aún si eres un excelente colaborador, beneficios cómo fondo de ahorro y vales de despensa al optener la planta."
good,Ryder is a great comapany to work for the time is there benefits is a plus although a driver must be flexible there are no set start time..must work various shifts
good,A company good to start off with. Has trouble hiring within when they like you where you are positioned. Management changes a lot. Do reward their employees.
good,Good place to work if you don't being at work all the time working weekends and walking a lot. I myself enjoy the problem solving issues throughout the day.
good,"Minimal schedule flexibility but decent managers/bosses. Not a lot of choices as far as where in the warehouse you want to work, majority forklift positions."
good,They talk a good game but don't follow through. They tell you one thing then change it .you tell them what you would like to do they say yes.then let someone not in management chang it.
good,"Management needs improvement, training technique could be better"
good,Tardan mucho en nivelar el sueldo y despiden sin justificación alguna
good,"Overall, my experience with them wasn't too bad.  I had never worked in a cooler before and that really opened my eyes to a different type of warehousing.  I think the most difficult thing about working there was the associates' attitudes towards their work and the importance of their quality of work."
good,"Transport Ryder rental equipment to different locations throughout the states of SC, GA, and NC.  Provide excellent customer service to Ryder's customer base."
good,Everything was good until they switched us from 8 hr shifts to 12 hr shifts 7/8 hour shifts are ok and do able. 7/12 hr shifts are outrageous and not realistic in expecting staff to not miss a day or 2 from time to time everyone needs a day to rest.
good,Ryder as a company is a great place .. worked17 years until management changed for the worst.. life and rules became unbearable..  work is regular .pay is regular..
good,"i consider Ryder a good place for someone who just starting out in the local truck driving industry, the equipment is reliable the miles are plenty but the pay is low."
good,A lot of back and forth due to work locations and being the only employee doing that particular job. Break room space very limited. Management expects more than what is actually capable. They think everyone works the exact same way.
good,Many departments going through a very rough time handling work life balance. Many times hard workers are past on for promotions and outside hires are brought in instead. Hard workers looking out for companies best interest and policy's are often reprimanded or worse fired while the ones that sit around doing nothing are rewarded.
good,My position is being eliminated after 19 years with Ryder.  My personnel record is spotless.  I do not feel this is fair to me considering my employment record/history being as it is.
good,"It was a good job, it’s got me by. It’s the best job I’ve had as far as pay. Nobody to help you move up in the business. The people don’t know how how to work together"
good,"It an alright job . The day yo day is very fast paced, you stand on your feet all day long. So if you can’t move around for 8 hours straight on your feet this is not the job for you."
good,"Ryder is a job, you start from the bottom. If you can make it threw the extra board until you can bid on a route, things will start getting better. And when toyota is close, ryder is close and thats about 4 weeks a year, great time for vacation."
good,"Good training resources available. Good supplier/customer relationship. High paced, just in time work environment; with good support system. Friendly."
good,Ryder had lots of turnover.  Very low salary paid to employees. Good events for morale were put on.  Great benefits for their employees.  Lots of temporary jobs offered at one point.
good,Follow up on the weeks priorities. Attend or schedule meetings to for continuous improvement. The workplace has a good culture and will invest in you to grow your abilities.
good,Ryder is a nice place to start your career. I have gained a lot of experience working with them for the past 3 years.I was able to get my MBA working with Ryder and the company paid for it.
good,Will look after you as long as you look after them will always be busy with  a variety of different tasks. Only downside nowhere for you to lunch unless you have a car and can drive to shops
good,"Best pay in trucking, the equipment is top notch latest freightliners, sadly management is ill equipped to handle the job. Arguably the best trucking company out of all the major players."
good,"Delivered alcoholic beverages/Kegs to various customer locations "
good,There is unlimited advancement opportunities within Ryder. The only downside is you will have minimal to no work life balance in customer facing roles.
good,Not what I was looking for in a company.  They need structure and organization.  Happy I made the move to leave and would not look back.   No advancement.
good,Very poor management. My mother had gotten very ill and they didn't really care and still gave me points even though I provided a legitimate doctors excuse. Smh
good,Learned how to work independently and developed strong office management skills.  Worked closely with customers and developed strong customer interfacing skills
good,I had the oppurtunity to work with a lot of really great people at Ryder but unfortuantly when a company gets as large as they are alot things slip through the cracks
good,I can not at this time keep emotions out of this review. Therefor I am not able to fill this portion of the survey out in a objective way. The description of how the typical day and hardest and most enjoyable part of this survey is not applicable at this time
good,"awesome company, great employees/ open door polices/competitive wages / never bored/learn more concerning the Transportation laws/ Interacting with the drivers on a respectful basis."
good,Drivers are quitting the job and it causes other drivers to pick up the slack. The pay scale was very poor. I started at 16.50 an hour and after 3 years I get 17.75 hour. And now they are starting new hires at 17.50 hour. And I brought it up to management and they said if you don’t like it you can leave.
good,Pay is below average for the amount of time you're required to work. Management doesn't offer anything for performance and pays the same no matter what type of account you have. Overall a decent place to work with plenty of opportunities for promotion but not much training.
good,I was excited to become part of a strong company but was disappointed in the ability in management to be able to successfully run a 24 hour operation.
good,"Not the best company, but not the worst. I have serious doubts about the management sometimes. The pay is not too bad and the hours are not bad either.  My only 2 big complaints is that if you want to move up it can take a very long time and you've got to jump through hoops to get it. My other grip is that some of the policy's are just ridiculous and it makes it easy to get written up especially when the management likes to cherry pick when they enforce the rules."
good,"Good benefits, team and working environment.  Promoted and supported outside learning for employees through seminars and training classes.  Collaborative work environment."
good,"good drivers, pretty good equipment, decent hours for work and time off.  bad management and supervisors that do not back their employees. little to no leadership in the day to day operaions."
good,"It is an okay company to work for, if you live locally. I enjoyed the people I work with, but not necessary into working around semi trucks or truck drivers."
good,had to fill orders to be shipped to the customers .. i was in charge of inventory control.... was detailed to a order picker i picked orders for all over the united states
good,"Benefits aren't terrible but its a pretty good place to work. Getting promotions can be very political. However, if you really do work hard and stand out, you'll impress them. Try to get to know the managers and they will look out for you. All in all, the company doesn't have a bad culture, and you gt a sense of job security because they don't lay off people. The only exception to that was during the recession & they compensated well."
good,"if Ryder starts paying a bit more money to its drivers and work on management and its communications and better training skills,  it will be a much better company."
good,Depending on what contract and customer you work with the jobs at Ryder can be easy and worth it. Others are over worked and the pay is not worth the stress
good,"It was an interesting experience, people are ok, hrs are ok pay was ok, work week was ok, training was ok,can learn different things, work on new and old equipment"
good,"es una buena empresa, solo que en el lugar donde estoy ,no hay la posibilidad de desarrollo"
good,it was a okay place to work the job training was not all that great.The work was difficult cause they would always move you around when you have not had proper training in that area.
good,Working at Ryder although it opened the doors for me to get a job at AT&T was not the best or the worst place to work no overtime was ever available and  very little chance of advancement.
good,"Ryder operates behind the scenes, managing critical fleet, transportation and supply chain functions for over 50,000 customers, many of which make the products that consumers use every day. When you choose Ryder, you get access to industry-leading technology, one of North America’s largest fleet of trucks, an expansive infrastructure of maintenance facilities and warehouses, and some of the most talented people in the industry."
good,"very demanding given 3 to 5 stops per day to drive ad deliver products in a safe an professional manner then return safely get 10 hours off  an do it again for 5 days.  The unloading varies some stops require a pallet jack some stops require rollers, some stops require use of a liftgate some do not."
good,"•	Facilitated 10 production associates and ensured quality within assigned area on the shipment dock"
good,"We would pack and unpack items, load them for shipments, and repeat the process as we kept our stations hazard free. It's very fast-paced. You are sending out truck shipments to different store companies to keep their shelves stocked. A lot of crude humor from random employees and it was very painful to continue lifting such heavy products repeatedly through the entire shift. However, we were able to make conversations almost freely with one another as we worked."
good,"a typical day consists of trucks coming in and out."
good,90% of the employees there don’t care about their jobs they are just there for a paycheck and the to rush home it’s a very unclean place there is always trash everywhere people do not care
good,Introduced to working in a large corporate environment was a great experience.
good,"As a 3rd Party Logistics Supplier, Ryder seemed unable to manage the business for our customer. Management always spoke about policies and procedures, but only randomly enforced them."
good,Maintained all Ryder lean tubing systems and dollies. I had the best Coworkers but upper management was not professional. I was let go due to company downsizing.
good,overall ryder was a good job. i learned a lot of things in both the billing side of the trucking industry and the logistics side of trucking. the management team was motivated and helpful.
good,Good entry level position for those fresh out of school. There are opportunities for advancement however they are limited and are taken quite quickly.
good,Good place to work nice hours nice pay nice paced production everyone got along well had a good strong team supervisors very helpful whenever i needed it
good,"Worked as manager trainee."
good,I had a good time until the end.I worked for them twice.It is high stress and you need to be ready to work.  Schedule can be hard at times. A lot of rule.
good,"Not Finding any major set backs at this time. Management is new so that makes thing a little different, Other than that everything else is fine. Could have more employee appreciations."
good,"This is a good starter job for individuals.  Laid back work environment, but no opportunity for advancement.  Peak time incentives are decent, and the company finds alternative ways to show appreciation to the employees."
good,Decent company to work for but don't expect to have a life outside of the company.  Not because of the company but because of the nature of the business.
good,Was their through an employmnet agency. It was not bad. Reasonably paced. Not a lot of chance to move up. Supoervisors were pretty good very laid back and helpful.
good,Nice work environment. Safety play a tremendous role there. It’s a safety memo every morning keeping you aware of different safety hazards and to prevent injury.
good,I did not stay long due to personal reasons as far as I could tell it was well rounded people were nice no issues and the pay could have been pretty good.
good,Never had a problem and would still be there if it wasn’t for losing the contract. Management was easy to work with. Had weekend days and weekdays off
good,"good employer to work for, not enough hours, pay rate was ok."
good,Line is constantly moving. I learned how to go with line pace. Management was couldve been better. Hardest part of the job was going along with nonsense. Most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment.
good,"work environment was okay. there was not much time given for vacation or sick days. It was a bit dysfunctional, but it was relocated which was the reason for leaving."
good,"Great corporate company."

good,"I haven't worked at Ryder Transportation Systems since the 1990s, so I can't tell you if it is a good place to work or not.  My only complaint was that there was little room for advancement at their Alpharetta office."
good,Busy amd fast paced from the I clocked in till the time i clocked out. Which made my day go quick. I loved staying busy. I learned a lot about logistics and warehousing.
good,what I can remember I had no issue working at Ryder I made many positive connections. would have to find another review to accurately gauge the work environment.
good,I no longer work for the company and do not wish to comment at this time. I was grateful for the opportunity of employment and enjoyed my co-workers most.
good,"The job is good for someone who is just entering the workforce.It was stressful, but people were always willing to help. I enjoyed the people at Ryder"
good,buena empresa pero con pocas oportunidades de desarrollo
good,"Ryder is an ok place to work. You need to buy all your own tools as a mechanic just remember that. its cool, you work, you get paid, you go home. not all locations operate the same though."
good,"You never work 40 hours"
good,"benefits are good. low hourly. no raise and im here for almost 2 yrs now. change is coming, hopefully for the better. learned a lot of thing though. so thank you for all the opprtinities."

good,"long hours, clean warehouse, was a start up to continue doing business with ConAgra, later to be bought by Treehouse foods, hours got long and no pay increase."
good,"Good place to work but not good for as student and those with family outside the United Stated of America. So it could be good for some people, and not really good for others"
good,"great place to start off a career, a lot of room for growth to a point. Great benefits and 401k  with stock options. Mostly fair and down to earth management."
good,really enjoyed this place of employment would really have liked to work straight threw the company and not threw a temp service that cuts my check in half and takes food out of my kids mouths.
good,"Great company, very very poor management on any level, they don't care your just a number to them, it took them 2 1/2 years for them to give me a .37 cents raise, I was there on my job didn't abuse of the sick times or vacation time and was skipped 3times for a preventative maintenance position, lots of  favoritism at Ryder, management don't care about you, if your not part of the click your not moving up at all,over all I managed to ern the employee of the month in august of 2014 with my outstanding work performance but that was about it, lots of hate came afterwards.I would have loved to stay at Ryder but after I saw them skip me 3 times and the people that worked that position left it did not even stay 6 months, after swing this action from management me asking for this position and qualified to perform it, I was defeated and lost all love and interest in the Ryder organization, but a great company but bad management."
good,It was a good job put frozen food in a freezer for nestle. Food like hot pockets and pizzas i also fixed broke palkets where we took a forklift and took boxes off restack them.
good,Great job go benfiets and ok paid and u can move up in the company and switch shops easy I not a fan of seond shift but if you hate seeing your family it is a great place to work
good,Direct Supervisor was one of the best leaders anyone could work for.  Upper management above that level and non existent to the actual working location constantly made poor decisions that limited the location manager from managing as required.
good,"Expected to experience continued growth through managements' window, but things began to randomly close doors that i've never expected. The company meant everything to be but sometimes when they say all good things come to an end, they make sure to end them for you"
good,"lost account ,lost job,delivering groceries to accounts,cant really say what the rest of ryder is like management were supportive. benefits ok. loved being home everyday"
good,"ryders bread and butter is maintenance so unless your the top dog don't plan to do much but Preventive maintenance, at least thats how it is at this shop. the other shop i was in in houston was way better structured.. just hard to move up quickly.  a lot of guy have been here for 20-30 years so job security is certainly there."
good,was a good place to work with good benefits and good pay. miles started being less and load and unload time being longer. yard finally closed due to lost accounts after main customer was bought out.
good,Just do your job and go home. Management does not take any responsibility for the wrong doings. The hardest part of the job is you have no one to help with problems with the union workers.
good,"Minimum benefits, no room for growth, lack of professionalism, so it's a dead end job. There is no job security and management has no foresight when it comes to it's employees."
good,"Management does not have good communication internally or with me. Most days, you have to fly by the seat of your pants on your own. The hardest part of the job is getting dispatched. Often I'm supposed to be in the driver's seat on my run, but with no dispatch until they get around to it. I do like being more independent but sometimes need support that just isn't there."
good,"Ryder logistics is a safety oriented company."
good,Good benefits and definitely a leader in their field.  Multi faceted and provides solution based selling options for rental and lease customers nationwide.
good,You have to keep moving and working when you are in the freezer to keep warm. The best thing is to keep picking the order until you fill the order. Once your done picking your order you stage it on the dock and shrink wrap pallet. Start on the next order etc...
good,"A typical work day at the office is very hectic on a high level.  Everyday is a new day you learn something new because there is a new situation you have to deal with daily.  Management is there when needed to help or give advise.  The workplace environment is very diverse. The hardest part of the job for me is transitioning from Payroll Clerk to Billing Clerk to Dispatcher, that usually consist of a 13-14 hours day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing the daily task."
good,"Your on a time study continually.  Mechanics jobs can be greasy.  Ryder's looking to retire older guy's.  They want to hire young guys. "
good,Always able to learn new thing. Great to be able to work with management and if I did not know how to do something would learn to the best and preform the task.
good,"I was a shift supervisor so it was quick paced, but the higher ups were not very helpful.  They expected you to know everything right away, but without the proper training.  I did what I could when taught properly.  It was a lot of figuring out on your own and going with the flow which I did, but it was hard without someone helping."
good,Good company to get a start. Pay should be based on driving experience rather than by company standards. Benefits for employees should be at no cost to the employee.
good,Working almost 70 hours a week does not always give much family time but the pay was good.  some days were busier than others but always busy which helped the day to go by fast
good,Have to always be working. They did not like anyone to be talking work related or not.  People are pretty laid back and for the most part easy to get along with.
good,Worked as a Data entry personnel and Direct/Deliveries. Environment was suitable for employees in a big warehouse located in Doral. All walks of life you would meet there
good,Typically worked 40 hours a week taking and making calls. Management is very strict and controlling. Culture of the job is very low morale. Working a call center setting.
good,could be better to work for . start times vary from day to day.you have days were you will work in sub zero temps in winter . summer temps get as high as 140 or above in back of trailer when unloading.
good,Strictly no working during lunch hour. Operate forklift to stuff ànd unstuffing goods from vendor trucks. Inventory control. Does packing and picking as well. Housekeeping.
good,"It's a good place to start your adventure in corporate America.  It really prepares you for the unfairness that occurs in the corporate world.  The suck ups will always be the ones that get promoted, and the people who believe in doing the right thing and working hard get screwed."
good,"Ryder was a great company to work for.. flexible hours, coworker easy to get along with everyone did their job. Managers worked with you and your schedule. Fast paced, clean, and organized."
good,I was with company about 71\2years responsible for picking up n counting freight from shippers and delivering product to costumer safely and on time.i was very reliable and a safe driver no accidents in sixteen years
good,"Large company which allows lots of room for growth from within."
good,"Since Hill Hire was taken over by Ryder, changes have been put in place.  Majority of staff have now left or working their notice and agency staff are on the rise."
good,Will not go into details. My time with has came to an end and was I'm for me to take a different path. This was to start my career in aviation field and I am loving it.
good,Kellogg was our customer. the company for making sure we take care of the customers and get all order picked and shipped. All the UPS and world ship orders
good,"only care about getting the miles done, any issue is always the drivers fault, some dispatchers care so it helped, but all truckers know that you are just a number"
good,"Certified in the operation of a propane-powered, industrial sized Fork Lift Truck in support of cross-dock processes managing inventory staging areas where inbound materials were sorted, consolidated, and stored until the outbound shipment was complete and ready to ship"

good,"Learned how to load and unload trucks, physical labor, swing shifts. Learned the value of a hard days work, co-workers worked well as a team."
good,"good working environment. "
good,"I joined Ryder with the intention of spending a considerable amount of time, committing myself to a new job in a new industry. Unfortunately for me my role was made redundant after 7 weeks of work as a significant shift in the Senior Management team took place. This has resulted in a massive reshuffle in relation to staff."
good,"Great place to start right out of school. However, it was a far distance to travel having a family. No opportunities for advancement."
good,Its a great place and does have room to grow. Its mixed with ethnicities and they take care of there employees. Treat us well and make sure safety is first
good,Its a great place and does have room to grow. Its mixed with ethnicities and they take care of there employees. Treat us well and make sure safety is first
good,A typical day at Ryder consisted of washing and fueling trucks that belonged to Ryder as rentals and trucks owned by individuals and companies with contracts with Ryder. I got on the job training in the general maintenance of trucks. Ryder also gave me the opportunity to learn how to drive a truck and helped in my effort to obtain my class B CDL.
good,Great co workers to work with.  Easy and friendly environment. Would love it more if offered to work full time.  Cut back on hours hurts.
good,Ryder Systems is one of the suppliers for General Motors. once i received my certification for Basic Operators i generally load and unload the trucks and also took material to the line.
good,"This place was horrible. Dreadful management, no organization whatsoever, and a lack of real leadership. This company couldn't even make up its mind on what schedule it wanted the workers to adhere to."
good,not a bad place to work at for a temp job. manger was very friendly towards me and not forceful in demanding where i had to driver to.
good,great place to work until the company was being brought of and all the years of your seniority wouldn't transfer over along with all the benefits we once recieve
good,I only give this company 3 stars because I feel there is not enough room for advancement for females. I also do not feel like they look out for their hourly employees best interest as much as they should.
good,"We work hard none stop ,fast working,everybody work together and I keep everybody going I can read the plan keep everybody busy all day im used to running 15 to 20 people on a job i build chic fila ,Wendy's,burger king,speed way truck stops,"
good,coworkers very welcoming an friendly wiling to give advice when needed. hard thing for me was loading trucks by hand because i am a female not very strong
good,"Ryder is a good place for a young person to start their career as Ryder has a culture that rewards hard work and quickly promotes qualified personnel from within at the lower ranks especially if they are willing to relocate. "
good,"Everything was good there. co-workers were well prepared for the job ahead of them. typically we would look over our forklift befor our shift, then go to our on board computers to see what needed to be done that day. Management was very good at what they did. The hardest part was working in the cold. The most enjoyable was the people that were working there."
good,Work pace is easy to maintain. Easy work. Work on class 8 trucks for various customers work ranges from oil changes to tires and lights.
good,The starting wage is fair and you can sign up for more over time.  If your a forklift driver its hard to get hired in because you only get 2 (occurrences) points during your probation period which is 60 days. The management is horrible and they play favorites.
good,HR really doesn't care about their employees. They just care about their self and stab you in the back.
good,The temp was blow 0.we did the best we could. Picked all the orders then load them up into the trucks. Very cold.That had to be the hardest part. The temp
good,Very good people work here. Company is very metric focused which can lead to a lot of stress from the corporate office. Poor work life balance.
good,"love the traveling to other counties, co workers are a good team."
good,No Comments. Job was good while it lasted. Unfortunately I was not retained due to another company taking over. My typical day at work was good. There were some great coworkers there for the most part.
good,"Hectic, but fast paced. Have to learn quickly. Little training. But, survived for 3 years. Grew to enjoy the fast paced environment. Pay couldve been better."
good,"mucho compañerismo y respeto "
good,"Ryder is multinational company with lots of branches in Canada and America. It is a transport company .I am working in Imperial Tobacco branch where supervisor and team leads are very good persons . My reason to change this company is that i am not getting my full hours work and there is no job security. This company hours work on production orders. When there is less orders , everyone leaves earlier  as orders done and vice versa."
good,"Starts off with meeting about work load then select equipment and start work till end.The Co-workers are entertaining, lots of bonuses.The hardest part of the job is very cold working conditions.The management in my opinion is hand selected and can't  keep stable supervisors.The turnover rate is terrible, which leaves to lots of mandatory overtime.                                                             Now Ryder will be bought out by Tyson Inc.and will strip employees of all bonuses that will motivate workers to perform above and beyond what is expected of them."
good,Good organization to work for. Good team work. Has a forward thinking mission statement and the positioned well for future market share. Could have better work/life balance control.
good,"trabajo  bueno y estable , pero no existe un manejo de categorias para poder escalar peldaños y poder tener una mejor expectativa. desafortunadamente existe mucha rotacion de personal y en ocasiones eso originaba mas carga de trabajo."
good,Stable but stagnant. Don't expect salary to grow without job-hopping. textexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttexttextexttext
good,I love the work that I do and the people I work with. The customers and employees are a blast to work with. Would like to have better benefits. End of quarter is always busy busy.
good,I enjoyed my time at Ryder logistics and the people i work with.  Everything changed and so did the working environment when the management changed.  Not everyone was okay with the changes.
good,fun work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop decent amount of red tape
good,"Challenging, but rewarding"
good,"Responsibilities Schedule and dispatch workers, work crews, equipment, or service vehicles to appropriate locations according to customer requests, specifications, or needs, using radios or telephones."
good,"No raises, co-workers with attitudes, heavy workload. You learn quite a bit in this position, but unfortunately it will most likely lead nowhere in the end despite promises to the contrary."
good,Good work place great group of guys to work with.Encourages employee development and results in a marked increase in workplace performance and satisfaction.
good,"Challenging, Supportive management, Crowded, Enjoyable to work with  colleagues. We learn a lot from one and another."
good,"we would clean, then get ready to paint,then tape off what needed to be taped off then paint then cut in then clean up get paid then go to next job and stsrt over"
good,management has no control very poor pay no potential to move up and they do not show there appreciation for there employees work at shops paying less that had more respect for there employees
good,"La rutina, solo se enfoca en como tienes que iniciar y trabajar tus actividades, pero no se detienen un poco para ver como apoyar al personal, para su crecimiento dentro de la empresa."
good,great entry level job to work but work environment is not environmentally controlled. Good area to start out at the warehouse.
good,Learned an exceptional amount of logistics through Ryder.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the scheduling of the work force and overall work load.
good,I have been working for this company for about two years. I have learned many new skills and have been able to advance my career level here.
good,"Mostly drop/hook dry van loads delivered to Vallarta Supermarkets. All local work. Need some good backing skills. Pays hourly, per mile, per drop, and detention. Good coworkers. Dispatcher needs better communication skills. He thinks he's the boss and likes to annoy drivers. The actual manager is the best boss ever. He won't micromanage you. Nothing really hard about the job. Pretty good benefits, decent paycheckG"
good,"Friendly co-workers, accessible management  learning effective time management prioritize workflow.  Juggling both incoming calls and actively monitoring routes via computer.  Enjoy providing customer service and resolving any carrier/plant issues"
good,"Started my career at Ryder, consider myself lucky to be able to start there. I did advance rather quickly in the first few months, but after 2 1/2 years have been in the same position, but they add a lot of responsibilities to the techs to make up for lack of management making it stressful at times. The lack of communication between management that is there can cause a lot of havoc daily causing a lot of lost time trying to figure out whats going on. Honestly a good place to work, but a lot of unneeded stress that shouldn't be on the technicians shoulders and all shops are the same."
good,"Nothing terrible to say about this place, but nothing great either. An ok place to start right out of college to gain experience, but limited advancement opportunities."
good,"excellent access to training material, and benefits are good...company is EXTREMELY policy driven, that they in effect create Soooo much red ted tape, it makes them woefully inefficient"
good,"A typical day consisted of scanning products, verifying its contents, relabeling the products and putting them on the assembly line. I learned how to work at a face face while following company rules. Management was there to watch and make sure we did our jobs correctly. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the standing for long hours."
good,"Multi-tasking is a must in this environment. A typical day at work can involve many tasks from reviewing customer orders, driver payroll to arranging collect freight shipments."
good,"I would come in and start working right away. Management says one thing and does something else or forgets what ""he"" said. Communication is a major problem between all employees due to management not being upfront with all employees. Blame is given to the wrong person(s). I would say there is definitely favoritism going on in this particular office! My co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job was having to take the blame for someone else's mistake(s). I enjoyed that we could laugh and joke with each until they took that away too! It was getting ridiculous there with management."
good,"Location is open 24 hours"
good,A typical day at Ryder was coming into orders that needed to be pick for the next day. The people were nice to get along with while working there.
good,for a review I would hold ryder up to a high standard .you get treated with lots of respect and ryder will do what ever it takes to train their employees
good,It was a fast paced environment.  Hewlett Packard was their customer and at times they were difficult to deal with regarding deadlines.   However the team did work well to get tasks completed.
good,Ryder has the best co-workers and some of the best managment in the business.
good,Lack of communication. Management was ok. They let people do whatever they wanted a lot of favoritism.
good,Great company with safety and employee care in mind at all times. Pay could be more competitive but outside of that I enjoyed my time there and would probably go back later in my career
good,Good work environment always something to do. Great supervisor
good,Managers have freedom to limit growth and stunt development
good,"If you're looking to get into a company to start you on your logistics career this is for you. There are many different accounts you can join. There is not a good work/life balance. There are advancement opportunities, only if you happen to know or talk to the right people it seems. However, there are fairly good benefits; Medical/Dental isn't bad, Tuition reimbursement, and 401k."
good,"Fast paced, strict working environment. Fun Friendly, enjoyed it for the most part"
good,"Great people and good environment to work.  As all warehouse jobs go, the company still needs to implement further changes to boost productivity instead of making mandatory overtime.  Management is very helpful along with the other associates."
good,"typical day; assess needed work and to assign right people to the task for maixium effiecency also to have parts available when truck arrives and to order parts for new found issues. On side note i also set payroll for submission, review work schedule for employees so ther are no gaps in coverage. To engage customers on all levels to ensure stable partnership"
good,"en mi area buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,its a great place to work. fun environment. wouldnt mind working for this company again.
good,"Company open to change"
good,Unload trailer and stage in open aisle. I Learned how to drive a slipsheet truck very well. Worked well management and co-workers.
good,"Learning experience, lots of knowledgeable things to learn."
good,Busy very fast paced. Learn something new everyday. Never encounter the same problem twice. Co-workers are very hands on and helpful.
good,"Arrive at work, see my dispatch and he'll hand my paperwork. I start my day."
good,Ryder is a very comfortable work place. The management always had a open door policy.
good,"At this site in Chattanooga, Ryder was a 3rd-party contractor for Volkswagen. Management could've cared less who you were or how good you were at what you were capable of... all they cared about was somebody finishing physically being able to come to work. All of the warehouse employees were paid the same, whether you drove a Forklift or swept the floors or stood around with your hands in your pockets, you made the same money. There were no employee evaluations because management had no intensions of paying anyone any different. The daily operations ran by way of a ""luck of the draw""... meaning, the few good employees that Ryder luckily ran into, were the ones who carried the weight of the many who didn't."
good,The work was very easy. Order picking small and light stuff.
good,great place to work plenty of opportunities to grow and always had different training if you wanted it.
good,the workplace is awesome but the money isnt that great and the mangment isnt either
good,"A place for advancement and opportunity, but very political in nature"
good,"Providing independent management and administrative support to the multiple dedicated carriage centers throughout an area. Responsibilities would include growth of business area, bottom line improvement, people development. "
good,"A typical work day for myself begins at eight in the morning. I begin by assessing the parts that need to be ordered and determine priority. I work within the Ryder intranet and have learned purchase orders, receiving, invoicing, among other things. I manage the work flow for technicians. The most enjoyable part of my job is when all components come together, as they should, in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the impatience of customers and not being able to meet their needs due to circumstances that are not within my hands."
good,Good company to work for. They have a good understanding of life work balance. They also provide a decent benefit package when i worked there.
good,-A typical day would just include sweeping out trucks and on the odd day they would have me file some documents. Work was fairly simple yet boring and repetitive.
good,its ok until something happens to you. they dont always work with everyone
good,Enjoyed my time there and truly value the experienced gained while working for Ryder.
good,"I learned time management as my first automotive job,people are nice just wanted to get closer to home"
good,"would review ryder as good company,the draw back is you dealing with a computer not people."
good,This job provided a lot of training opportunities. Management was fair as was the pay and benefits. I enjoyed working for the company!
good,"go in and do your jod that is assinged to you"
good,management was cool staff was cool the job was easy fun and busy which made the time go by quickly.
good,Ryder is a good place to work. I get along with management and my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is the heavy work.
good,"Fairly decent company, not enough room for growth and advancement."
good,Ryder is a place to get experience and has a good team to work with.
good,"Stay productive all day, and the work is the same daily. No new things to learn after overall training."
good,Ryder provided training if and when needed.  They allowed me to operate on my own and make decisions that assisted both Ryder and our client.  I worked on site as the only Ryder employee for our client.
good,"It's a great place if you like to work alone. The quotas were reasonable, lots of manual labor. I learned the concept of time management."
good,"Very little training for job requirements; left to your own devices much of the time with serious decisions to be made, punished if wrong decision is chosen; difficult work environment with a lot of conflict and poor leadership; rewarding interactions with customers and being able to provide for their needs, both immediate and long term; rewarding interaction with vendors and sales force."
good,"Perform maintenance and repair on a fleet of equipment to include, 24 tractors and a fleet of Thermo King refrigeration trailers, maintain customer relations, establish and manage a monthly budget."
good,"Every night I audit the shipments by the docks that are ready to go out and then proceed to make sure that UPS and FedEx trucks are loaded to leave the next day. Since being at Ryder, I have learned different functions of the scan gun. I do multiple tasks each night and get along well with all those whom I work with. The hardest part of the job is to get all the packages needed at all times to ship to the customers in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get holidays off."
good,Everyday is different you don work on the smae type of truck year make or model. always learning and improving on ways to get the job done right and fast.
good,a typical day if u r on a forklift is hard they would give u so much to do in a little amount of time 
good,"procurred transportation for customers shipping their products either by truck, rail, plane, or boat."
good,Ryder Logistics is very fast past and productive work place to be involved in. They are about making sure that we get our work done in a fast but safe way and to make sure the customer will be happy with what they will receive.
good,3am start time
good,I was a Rental Management trainee for Ryder and took the job as a way to advance from my previous job at Sherwin Williams. The job changed from 55 hour weeks when I started to barely even a full 40 hour workweek when I was let go.
good,"I enjoyed running a poly bag machine, I got to work on my own and enjoyed working with co-workers."
good,Its a good place to work at if you like up and down hours. i learned how to recieve product from incoming trucks and also learned how to Drive a clamp truck. Some oof my co-workers are good people. Hardest part of the job is the long hours during the summer.
good,great enviornment and the job can either be simple or difficult if you let it.
good,Worked for 5 years enjoyed time there several changes in managment in later years lots of changes
good,Ryder is good company to work for . good opportunity to cross train in different dept.
good,"I worked a graveyard shift for 5 years untill i got divorced and won sole custody of my kids. Being a new single parent i had no help with child care for nights. Managment tried to talk with union rep to see if i could change shifts before shift bid and possibly keep a first shift but unoin would not move any one. There fore i ended having to leave becsuse i couldnt leave my kids home alone. There loss , ryder has a 11% rework limit on all techs. While the average tech 1 through 4 had about 11 to 14% rework. I never had over .25% My work was done right the first time. The unoin dont care about that and must not been important to ryder."
good,"The job requires much more than what was told during interview. I have worked there for over 2 years now and the work load has quadrupled, but have yet to receive a raise. My coworkers are wonderful but management is not there for you. They will not stand up for you and they will make you look bad, while making themselves look good. I have learned a lot about customer service, but you learn everything on your own. The training is very poor."
good,"Only worked as summer intern for one summer. Dealt with customers who are truckers which can be difficult - especially as a women. Hourly pay was not great however, standard hours and work/life balance made up for it."
good,Reasonable place to work
good,"You will not find better group of people to work with. I have worked here for a year, but the hours we work I have technically been here 2 years."
good,worked @ night typical night job enjoyed having my days off !!!
good,I coordinate operation between two warehouses. I have to work in a timely manner because that ensures smooth operation in both warehouses. I am also responsible for training new drivers and supervise them.
good,"A typical day at work is entering the daily driver trip sheet into computer and customer service. I learned all the aspect of logistic and also on the job training as a supervisor, once I completed management course. I enjoyed working with all of the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning and working with the co-workers."
good,"I learned how to scan material, drive machinery, and training."
good,"Some of the management really sucks at Ryder. There environment is laid back but busy. It keeps you on your toes. Very hot warehouse but it cool. Seeing the same people everyday is amazing, people grow as your family."
good,Just another job to work at. There really wasnt any probelms here. They treated their employees very well. Great benefits.
good,The warehouse was very hot in the summertime and freezing cold in the winter time. Some of the people I worked with were really great. I meat a lot of nice people.
good,"Easy going facility, other techs very helpful. We work as a team here. There are many benefits to look forward to. Pay is good and management will help you."
good,Mostly drop and hook  worked day and evening schedule  worked some Saturdays  never had a dedicated run miles were sporadic  dispatch tried to keep with 1000 miles weekly
good,Worked night shift. Started out ok. Then was working 55 to 60 hour weeks. Was salary. 800 a week. When was off. Pay changed. Ryder took care of truck.
good,"a typical day a work was nothing out of the ordinary"
good,With 3PL Customers are always number one priority no matter where or who you work for. Ryder seem to  e able to balance it customer employees priority.
good,"You get some what of a workout because it's a very physical job. I get along with most of my coworkers and people generally help you out when you need it. There a few employees think there God, I just avoid them. 3/4 of the management is knowledgeable, I'm confident with them."
good,"A typical day at Ryder shop is chaotic and can be down right a nightmare. The shop in Salt lake is like no other in the company. The shop may get 20 drive ups more then 200 calls and 6 or more service calls. Weighing the corporate direction with functional is all but impossible. The stress the company BU leaders through at the terminal are beyond reasonable. There is also a push to do what is not asked by corporate. The BU pushes its people to follow BU direction while having to answer for the corporate directive. "
good,I do not feel comfortable continuing to sell an inventory that is not at the level of quality that has been advertised.  There is daily issues and I wish to serve my clients better than this.
good,"Ryder is a good gate way company for technicians to learn and improve upon their skills at an OEM level.  However once you prove you can put your new skills to work, Ryder does not seem to keen to recognize your new abilities in the way of career advancement."
good,Ryder does not have adequate manpower to perform assigned tasks. Many routes are overworked and often do not get their full breaks. Too many draconian rules.
good,Good company got to be fit and inshape delivery in a timely fashion multiple routes lots of lifting and in and out of the truck all day worling 10 to 16 hours days
good,its a job that needs uptempo energy and motivation. anybody with common sense can keep this job fairly easily. It is not a place for lazy people. must be willing to work
good,"Easy job, but the hourly pay for class A drivers is way too low. Probably the lowest in the industry. The only way to make a good check here is with a ton of overtime. They need to raise the entire payscale and they would keep more drivers."
good,"I would still be there if they had not laid me off, but it was a good place to work for and could have been my retirement place i liked the money but not the hours"
good,"You will be expected to run your load every day, when it is available to run."
good,I like Ryder but they asked 2 weeks because I made them aware that my co-driver interrupted  my sleep using phone and driving. Against company policy. I lost job. They black listed me.
good,"You are there to work plain and simple.  You service the customer.  When their work schedule changes so does yours.  Forced overtime is common practice."
good,"overall not a bad shop to work for just not at all wanting to be on call to fix over the road trucks or trailers anymore, culture is good and got a decent amount of training in so far."
good,New safety procedures and equipment caused  my termination. It was bad decision by upper management to allow new equipment to make my job impossible to perform under a new excessive safety policy.
good,"I would usually get good but late hours starting around 2:30 am and getting out around 12:00 or 2:30 pm. I learned how to trouble shoot shipping errors, how to processes boxes and pallets threw (putty) program. Management was good they would always give us something to be doing. The hardest part would getting threw the late hours when they would keep us longer than expected or just random changes or work shoulders. The best part would be how fast paced the work environment is and how there always something to do, so that just makes time go by faster."
good,"This was a huge benefi,t in that making decisions regarding customers was left up to me as the person working closest with the customer.  Promoted the relationship as an important part of the sales process."
good,Was a good place to work for as I worked for them for 11-12 years. Pay was competitive with good benefits. I liked working 4 10’s. But when Ryder lost account I think Ryder could of tried harder to take care of us employees
good,I was welcomed right off the bat in a very friendly and family type of atmosphere. I received full trying and continued to learn new things consistently. It was a laid back atmosphere but you knew what was expected of you and we all worked together as a team to see that things got done. There was never any need for micro managing.
good,"Overall, a good place to work.  The only real complaint is that the upper leadership on site has a difficult time enforcing the attendance policy.  Some folks seem to miss an inordinate amount of days with no repercussions."
good,"Ryder provides longevity however there are no room for advancement if you do not posses the right qualifications. No training provided to help individuals succeed to higher positions."
good,"The staff was wonderful, but too much politics at the region I worked at. For most part, wasn't a bad job overall; five day work week with rotating Saturdays with mediocre pay."
good,"Good equipment very bad communication from dispatch to driver usually driver to driver was the way to know when shipment eta,no leadership witch leads to low morale."
good,What a company. Very good to work for. Many activities through the day followed by many meetings and safety power points. What a great company and a great bunch of great folks.
good,Technicians are very helpful and knowledgeable to train or help others. Management seems to single out and pick on tHe same person... excellent work place bad management
good,"Unfortunately, the Ryder Integrated Logistics account was discontinued since we were supporting Lucent Technologies. Lucent Technologies went out of business."
good,"Long stressful work days in a fast paced working environment. Rental counter position requires a high level and patience, tolerance, stress management."
good,great personal but the pay formula change so the driver get pay less. i know for facts the company is good to work for but the pay got worst in comparison with others state
good,"I love the route I am on but paid far less than the industry standard. More so the account I am on (Charter),  than Ryder. I do feel that  more could have been done within Ryder management to increase pay."
good,"Good Company, staff and co-workers"
good,"Good maintenance on equipment,safe workplace.Good communication between manager and employee.They provided us with safety equipment/wear.Its a multicultural environment."
good,Very.fast pace with all types of truck drivers meet a different driver every night some of the people there was good as gold others was bad news  the only thing I didn't like was the weather always cold cause it sat on a hill we all would decide on lunch always something different I liked going and picking up lunch for my shift it was always something different to do at the shop
good,"Training is provided."
good,"I worked at Ryder during my infancy of warehousing in general. The start up was horrible, but aren't they all? Over time the team pulled it together, and made it a pretty good place to work."
good,Sometimes crazy sometimes fun but almost always stressful. Teammates are helpful for the most part and the job is very fast paced but underpaid for all the time and work that needs to be done
good,Very large company that treats you like a number.  Whatever they tell you when you get hired can change in an instant.   Everything depends on the account your on.  And who your manager is.  An account can be lost or expired at any time then your screwed.  Beware!  Their good accounts are good but most are not.
good,"Ryder was a very good job for me at the time I had it, the advancement was slightly lacking but was made up for with the compensation, ryder is a very good company"
good,This company you can work smart get the job done.The fast paced work you work together as a team workers I work with are helpfull. And understanding just get the job done.
good,"Workplace culture is non-existent.  Whether you are a senior manager or tech on the floor little to no consideration is given to employees beyond completion of the days job.   The only exception is employee appreciation day when you are given a $25.00 gift card."
good,"Hard working, dependable work in the shipping department where we handle hp computer products. Heavy work load differs from day to day"
good,"Enjoyed my work family, not so much a women's world for advancement. Most days where always different and I learned something new daily. I enjoyed being in customer service and feel I was strong at my title."
good,Start the day off at 3pm to 1130pm. I learned to watch the fleet and things that may be wrong with a truck just on a look over. The coworkers work as a team up until the management level. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly drivers coming in always in a rush. The best part of the job was learning part of the trucking industry.
good,"Love the company, but the C level and the guys on the ground just are not always on the same page. Hard to follow up on your promises to customers with the resources provided. Still, a great company to work for."
good,Pick and Packaged orders to be delivered by van drivers for customers. l did returns put stock away. Learned to use a scan gun to pick orders with. Management could have been better. Make sure we got all the orders done everyday. l enjoyed doing different jobs everyday. My co-workers was good.
good,I would not recommend someone to work for this company. I work 10-12 hours a day with no opportunity for advancement and management never comments on all the hard work that I put in.
good,I worked out of Cedar Falls but management was based in Texas. It was fast paced at certain points of season. You were responsible to manage your work time.
good,"Ryder as a company is not a bad company to work for. My main issues for wanting to leave the company have to do with the fact that in my field, I do not get the chance for much free time away from work to spend with my loved ones. Those in management positions there aren't all that bad, although they are very ""by the book"" so to speak and aren't very flexible when it comes to special cases."
good,"It has been a good job, But A longterm future with the job, is out of reach. the people you will work with all tend to be very good people"
good,Great place to start and easy to advance. They also have a relocation program if you are looking to travel. Very little incentives however there are some
good,"long hours of work, several calls, e-mails, hard industry. Long days of dealing with hostile customer and time is the biggest concern for everyone. I like the pay and benefits they are very competitive."
good,"I managed 11 drivers and handled their payroll, all of their trip information, ordering supplies for trucks, tracking shipments and much more.  I learned a great deal about the trucking industry while there.  All of my co-workers were friendly and helpful.  My manager was also the dispatcher and he depended on me to take care of everything OTHER than dispatching.  There really wasn't anything difficult about the job.  I was good at it and liked it very much,"
good,Good company to work for nothing bad to say lots of overtime great group of people
good,"Ryder is a strong and reliable company, there are many long term employees. There is a strong sense of ethics with this company. Some difficulties involve IT infrastructure and manual processes, career growth requires a lot of travel. There are opportunities for growth and personal learning."
good,This job included answering calls for customers wanting to rent trucks for different reasons. I worked in the side that resoled issues with customer whose orders weren't processed properly and trying to make the appropriate adjustment from getting them another truck to refunds.
good,Everyone is friendly. No complaints. A typical day at work is going to one location picking up a truck and driving it to another location. Most of the time I have someone following me in a chaser truck or I drive the chaser truck
good,No opportunity to advance. 12 hour shifts with no lunch breaks. High cost Benefits. No time off.
good,"Everyday was a busy day, in a good way. There was always something to be done. Going to work everyday and working with my co-workers always make work fun. They were more like family, than co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying, at the time, to balance it all. How to make time to get everything done."
good,"The work to family ratio is not what the average person with small children would want unless you like spending time away from your family. "
good,A typical day was everything listed in my resume. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable. The Transportation industry is very time sensitive and customer demands can be extreme; complying with DOT standards is mandatory. Meeting these demands takes a team working together to keep our customers on the road. Accomplishing these goals on a daily basis is most satisfying.
good,"This is a good place to learn about the big company structures and functions. I am in a 10 week rotational program that takes me from account to account to learn about how they function and learn about their daily processes. The co-workers are nice, but some not as much. The management is OK. There are good days and bad. The hardest part about the job is it's hard to learn anything thoroughly when I only get 2-3 days per account. The most enjoyable part is I get to plan my own schedule as long as I get my work done on time."
good,"Day starts at 4am, check the load monitor, log in audit sheets, make gate passes to drivers when they reach the plant, answering the phones, scanning PODs, dispatching drivers."
good,"Revolving door of new drivers , and constant changing of routes and schedules, poor compensation of salary, not what you would expect from the time from interview to start of job...With the new rules of DOT hour of service , the weekly benefits have dropped. Too many days off , work is based on performance only not an hourly compensation .."
good,"It was a great job at first but company got sold new management "
good,Working at Ryder is similar to trying to drink from a fire hose. It's fast paced work days will keep you on your toes and your mind will always be in motion with your body. The management is not overly professional so this gives employees a higher comfort level when management is around. Everyone works just as hard as the next person. 
good,"I like my duties Because time went fast And have a great time with my co-workers, Learned to work in almost all the departments that Ryder had, The hardest part of my job is that warehouse didn't have A good  ventilation, And the most enjoyed is getting paid for the things that I like to do At work"
good,el trabajo en ryder es de surtir las lineas de produccion de remy alternadores hay aprendi el manejo de materiales y los compañeros de remy me enseñaron a manejar las maquinas de produccion la gerencia estaba muy al tanto de lo que pasaba los compañeros eran buena onda pues ayudaban en todo tanto los de ryder como los de remy en el trabajo no era tan dificil lo que asiamos me gusto trabajar en la empresa ryder por el compañerismo y el anbiente de la empresa
good,"Managed receiving dock of apprx. 35 associates. The day consisted of an avg. of 35 inbound deliveries and were reloaded with empty containers for suppliers. As Logistics Manager for the receiving dock I was responsible for verifying discrepancies against the Bill of Lading. Perormed daily metrics, forklift training, and verification of daily work hours."
good,"Coming to work and the truck drivers, over the phone customers, GM personnel wanted to speak with only me for assistance."
good,The environment was a possitive place to be daily. I unfortunately missed the one on contact of the customer experience. I sat at a desk on the phone and found it difficullt to do that since I was used to retail.
good,Worked from 8-till whenever my work was done for the day.
good,The pay at Ryder is not good and giving a raise. The pay is not very good for regular employees who work hard.
good,I enjoyed working at this job. Easy job the people were cool. Not hard on the body. Lots of walking and standing get comfortable shoes. Stressful at times trying to get everything out on time.
good,Like that very much I work there 5 years ran a dedicated run From Bixby turn Chambersburg Pennsylvania Manager and office was great worked 4 day a week loved it 2008 stock market crash killed the run
good,they have to bid for your routes every month starting with the drivers who have been there the longest down to new hires.  the truck are junk and have cameras on the driver and the road that send reports to safety every time you hit a pothole. benefits are great people there are great. salary is fair your guaranteed a min of $1100 a week. bad reputation of firing employees before the benefits even start.
good,"I had to work double sifts at least three times a week. The company was not understanding during the period my son had brain surgery. Know one was available to help me understand and how to apply for Family Leave."
good,No experience dispatcher to be a well how to relate with the drivers and two fairly dispatch loads. The truth to the story did that there was too much favoritism and picking overloads and given certain loads to certain other than that writer was a great place to work
good,Manager don't care about getting work for drivers. Have open door policy. They refer you back to problem source. Putting freight on outside carriers. When we are there to haul it.
good,"Ryder is a great company and benefits are great. Company can use a better supervision team or some training for supervision. A lot of micro-management, lack of positive reinforcement for employees."
good,Need to find another job because this account has slowed down big-time not making the money that I used to make I was hauling Automotive Parts into Chrysler plant in Belvidere
good,"In the beginning tough, once I learned operation and best way of doing things that was more of a hands on than what I was trained to do it became very routine and not bad, lots to do never a stop to things to do and manager was tough but knew his job which helped me learn, advancement was tough felt like there was a bit of a click with the team and if you were part of it you would advance at a faster rate as far as Management positions went, I liked the fact that 8 hours was the scheduled hours if you stayed it wouldn't be more then a 10 hour day in most cases. Pretty nice people nice supervisor office for supervisors and up to date shops in most cases."
good,"third party logistics provider, profit driven with work quotas. good human resources department, good training programs, management was responsive to employee concerns and needs"
good,"Home time is very good, home everyday and that is very important to me. I understand why drive cams were installed. Company stated it was mainly for accident exoneration, not surveillance. However it has become just that. They also installed the merritor wabco system that measures following distance. If computer feels your too close, it automatically slams your brakes on. This in my opinion is very dangerous with winter road conditions and Chicago rush hour which I'm in daily. The device is beeping all day while in Chicago. To me, that is a huge distraction. My dispatch person and upper are quality people who I have a awesome working relationship. I fully understand that these devices were completely out of they're hands. Corporate decision. Again,not a problem with camera, just how it's now used"
good,"I drove a single axle tractor that bounced around a lot due to it only being a single axle. the camera triggers any bump or sharp turn or hard breaking action, they're looking at everything you do to reprimand your driving, you'd figure after driving for 17 years of safe driving that would speak for itself. When they implemented this device it was told to us it was there to protect us and the company from other drivers actions, later we all found out it was to target us for everything we do wrong, but it doesn't record any good we do."
good,"A typical day is non-stop and fast paced in the office. Phones constantly ring with road calls and customers needing information about units. Typically there are no notes in the system so immediate communication is difficult. Management is never around, and HR complaints result in ""It will get better...just give it time."" Everything you learn will be OJT."
good,"The majority of positions are only as secure as the account your hired to work on. If the company looses that account, an employee must apply for another job within, they DO NOT move the employee to another account and shows no compassion towards the employees facing this."
good,"Trabaje en el almacén de Ryder ubicado en la planta Carrier C, siguen la misma metodología de trabajo que su cliente y eso es bueno."
good,"Good $$. Easy job. Not so good hours. Live there ALOT. 8 hr days are a blessing lol, pretty much a 10 hr job. If u love to live at work this is the job for you. At times we've worked 12 hrs for 6 & 7 days for a few months at a time."
good,"Great company culture, friendly people, and I learned a lot of valuable skills, however, I was not told during my interview that the hours would be excessive. I work a minimum of 10 hours per day, usually 12 hours, and I work weekends as well. It's difficult to have a work/life balance when you spend all your waking hours in the office. The management team is knowledgeable and respectful, and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to work for this company."
good,"You never know when you’ll be stuck working outside in the elements. Pay is good advancement opportunity is decent at best. The guys in the shop are easy to get along with, with the exception of a few individuals. Overall not a terrible place to work. But there are better options"
good,"Ryder is a good place to work if you don't mind the cold. Hours were good,you work 12 hour day for 3 days and have 4 off. They provide all the cold gear for you."
good,"This position was strictly handled in a call center, I am use too hands on so it was very different, it was poorly managed and by that I mean there was a huge turnover ratio."
good,"very enjoyable , fast paced, but duh! its a warehouse, it wasn't as friendly as i thought it would end up being.Very competitive as any job. training on certain parts of the warehouse. but in all the time went by fast only because it was constant moving and working ."
good,"The job is not as stressful as it ends up to be, tarping and unloading in bad weather is the biggest problem.  It is a hands on job in delivering steel. The biggest plus is you have a Local route and you are home daily and no weekends."
good,"I formerly worked as a diesel technician for Ryder Truck Rental where I performed many different diesel diagnostics, repairs, and rebuilds.  I also received training from my supervisor on the skills needed to be a shop supervisor."
good,"On a typical day I just show up and the manager gives us the tasks we have for the day whether its a unit in for Preventive maintenance or a unit broken down. Since I've started there I've learned and got a lot of hands on experience on all the different systems and components from light duty to heavy duty diesel trucks and 18 wheelers. From changing tires to replacing clutches to disassembling and reassembling engine components plus much more. Management lacks experience but is fair, just lacks in taking care of his employees. Doesn't like to give what's already given to us by the company such as quarterly safety lunches or quarterly safety bonuses. Everybody gets along and works together to get jobs done. Hardest part for me is knowing a coworker makes as much as me but doesn't do half as much or know half as much as I do. Most enjoyable part is the people I work with and the satisfaction after completing a long repair on a unit and giving it back to the costumer."
good,The company itself is a great company but then you have to deal with a lot of disrespectful instances and also within this company I had saw a lot of favoritism and no equalism. I had been with the company for more than 2 months and had completed my training to become a Quality Assurance associate but for me that wasn't enough so my qualities and skills would have been withheld for me to increase my job  skills.
good,I was just let go on Friday without warning due to the organization resolving my group. I had been an employee for eight years and instead of them placing me into another position I was terminated. I just heard another group is being affected and they were given a 30 day notice to find another position with the organization. Nothing is ever streamlined across the board. I'm curious as to why they were offered this and my group was not.
good,"Ryder as a whole company, was an absolute blast to work for. Nothing bad to say about them. The particular manager at the location I worked at, had an extreme lack of communication with its employees on a day to day bases; considering things could change by the hour or minute during your shift. This would cause mass confusion on ""Ryders'' employees part and a spoken feeling by employees of the company that we where contracted out to was, ""Why do we need you? Why are you here?"" This is a critical part. Most of the time when a situation would happen, the (contracting company*), would believe it was Ryders' responsibility and not theirs. This is when I look to Ryders' management because this was an regularly occurring issue. To be honest, I believe this could have been addressed by making sure the (*) management knew their responsibilities. Part 2 of that problem. The turnover with the (*) management. ""They did not know their responsibilities."" So either that manager would be fired or see that the place lacks direction and transfer. Most of the complaints I would make to Ryders' manager about the (*) management would go unanswered and cause more chaos."
good,pre and post trip of truck and trailer. Very physical job tailgating carper pad weighing anywhere from 60-75lbs. Nice place to work employees are great to work with.
good,stressful day going in & out. hardest part off job is staying over when other shift doesn't come in for another 4 hours.& dealing with other employeesthat are really lazy and doesn't follow the rules because supervisors doesn't do anything about it.best thing about the job is driving forklifts
good,I enjoyed working at Ryder. The management was helpful and very friendly. I learned a lot from working there and it was a great stepping stone in the Logistics field.
good,great place to work as a flatbed truck driver delivering 21 to 25 stops a day in a residential district and 45 to 55 foot trail it wasn't easy enjoyed the pay
good,Ryder is a good place to work... they pay you for working hard and make sure you get great results of your hard working.. I would still be there but personally reason made me quite
good,A very big company. Providing logistics services as well as freight movement. Poorly organized at the dispatch level. Pay and benifits are fantastic if you can put up with being set up to fail
good,"A typical day at work starts with picking up a pre-loaded van and the paperwork, then delivering orders to customers throughout different regions of the Fraser Valley."
good,"Was exciting and demanding place to work as the customer expectations were high, which they should be. Go in with a plan for the day, but one phone call from the customer changed your plan(s) for the day."
good,"Worked in a warehouse everyday picking parts to deliver to different areas of the warehouse. Learned about different products and how they get packaged. Management was always pleasant, It was typically stuffy but that's to be expected in a warehouse.The hardest part of the job was trying to get so much done in so little time. Most enjoyable part was seeing different parts of the warehouse and how they worked."
good,A typical day for me at work is scheduling railcars for loading operations and also billing railcars out of the plant that have previously loaded. There is always an opportunity to lean something new which is always a good thing in any work environment. The amount of detail and knowledge that can be gained is vast. I think that is the most enjoyable part about the work that my team and I do. The hardest part is trying to find immediate and temporary solutions to complex and urgent situations or trying to find long term solutions to prevent any negative impact to productivity.
good,"Good place to work, good company. Great place to start out at and grow a career and strengthen your skill set. Great upward mobility."
good,"Everything is okay when you are on your own, but when certain people are there they will watch you and be rude for no reason while distracting you from your job."
good,I only worked for them a short time span so there is not much I can say . It's a job. I was able to provide for my family as long as they let me. That's all I can say.
good,"Management was very nice and the dispatchers were ok but they required you to work 12 to 14 hours a day 5 days a week with no overtime pay. The trucks are not in the best of shape. A few would not pass a roadside inspection but the company still expected you to drive it anyway. Also, the containers we picked up from the rail yards were usually in very bad shape and often required you to either go to roadability to get it fixed which would usually cause a long delay and preventing you from finishing your work in the time allotted, or take it as is, usually with many lights not working, and hope you don't get pulled over."
good,I love the fast pace work of logistics. The people that worked for me were great. The hardest part of the job was keeping the customer happy.
good,"Ryder is a productive and fun workplace. I loved my managers and the people that I worked with. "
good,"They are a great company but offer no raises to the Dispatch team."
good,Tough margins to compete with emerging companies. Preferred candidates selected for openings.
good,"Office clerk"
good,"A typical day at work, in the Account Manager position, includes early morning conference calls to monitor sales quotas, call volume, and next steps to win business.  In office from 8-10, then on the road prospecting customers until around 3, return to office to answer emails, submit quotes to customers, and log sales activity. "
good,There are multiple things to do within the job title.  Always something to doeven if it isn't in your job description.  So a person could stay busy all day.
good,I worked over 20 years and found that even with exceptional work ethic and high scores on my annual appraisals it took me over 10 years to be promoted to a sales position.  My male counterparts were promoted in less than 5 years to the same positions.
good,"Excellence is demanded, and a team spirit makes the efforts worthwhile. Definitely a drive to work, but the HQ has everything you need from a gym, to a cafeteria and gift shop with its own pseudo-starbucks inside."
good,Learned how to foucus both on internation and domestic transportation.
good,Typical day at Ryder was a bit of work but nothing I wasn't able to handle. I did almost all that the men that worked for the company could do. Another great opportunity 
good,Great place to advance in the transportation industry. They are nation wide.
good,"Typical work day you answer phones and route freight for whatever account you are on. You ensure on time delivery, conference calls, award bids. Everyone works as a team and even management will jump in a help when needed. Best part of the job is being able to learn new things and learn about other customers"
good,A typical workday is extremely hectic and fast paced. Managers are very helpful and extremely supportive. Co workers are fun loving and positive people.
good,"Supervisors are great to deal with , customers are pleasant to work with as well"
good,A decent company that has seen itself through the economic downturn in a favourable position.
good,The job was very busy and boring. Eights hours of doing nothing but the same thing over and over and over again with no changes.
good,Ryder really taught me alot. Overall you are self managed. You are shown your job and expected to get it done.
good,"Really enjoyed working with Ryder. They taught me a lot. However the salary was very poor. Great place to learn your craft but unfortunately, if you want to make market wages you have to leave..."
good,An idea place for people wanting to get into the diesel field. They just offer the basics when it comes to benefits. Depending on location pay can be decent to good.
good,"My daily tasks at the job involved me coming to work prepared to perform different jobs ,  which  was needed for the company. It involved me cleaning lines off for processing to complete daily quotas. Removing accesses waste from production lines as needed and replace with empty containers for further use . Although the job was for individuals , teamwork was always there if needed."
good,Easy going shift. Laid back culture. All about business. Come in and do your job and you will be fine. The equipment is easy to master. The system has its glitches but once you learn it its a breeze
good,"at Ryder you are defiantly a just number the dispatch was OK but you would be pulled into office over any and all problems. i did not like that they had cameras on you at all times. they have a program called captain of the ship but didn't allow you to use it would harass you to come in or keep going any ways."
good,Great flexible hours. Enjoyed working with the employees there. Fast pace environment which makes the time go by fast. Loved  the ten hours shifts and overtime
good,"Some nights you hit the ground running and go non stop until it's time to go home, and some times you just sit there for hours."
good,"The driving portion of the job is a very ""typical"" truck driving culture. Ryder's management has started to evaluate driver performance based upon those (faulty) electronic devices -- lane deviation / following too closely / speed-braking systems / on-board cameras, etc -- and ignores the skill-set of highly qualified drivers...  meaning, Ryder does not believe in human drivers having the ability to actually drive a truck, but they place their trust in (proven faulty) electronic equipment instead."
good,"This was a fast paced position, working with all of the other teams on the account. Management was easy to work with and gave clear direction. Worked with customer for all variances."
good,Great place to work just need more home with your family benifits were better than most just like  to be with my family more than 12 or 14 hours a week
good,"Worked 40 hours a week M-F. No weekends and started around 830A.M. Pick orders all day, easy work. Not a stressful job but you really have to move your feet to fill up to 100+ orders a day.. No room for advancing with the company unless somebody quit , but in reality if you do move up the pay is in cents, not worth it."
good,"Engaging with the customers on your account. Assisting the day to day shipments in scheduling, rate quotes, routing to the appropriate carriers and escalation issues.  "
good,"Start with yard check.  I learned to watch my back, it is cutthroat and stressful. I never had an issue with my local management.  You don't see much of upper management. Just a ton of emails from them about how poorly your department is doing, no positive feedback.  The worst part of the job is upper management.  The most enjoyable part is when we would all work together and accomplish something amazing."
good,"Not bad ,not that great either."
good,Good for technicians that want experience. No need for ASE certifications. No college needed for hiring. Most managers and supervisors are good. Grand Prairie location not so much.
good,Ryder was a great chance and company for me but with no way to advance I had to leave them and look for other and better opportunities for me and my family.
good,"Was a good place to work in the beginning. But I did  notice alot of favoritism. Also, management was very unprofesssional about                 not discussing other workers private affairs. They don't treat you well at all if you have a accident on the job. That is the whole reason why i quite."
good,"I love Ryder and working on trucks and I also love the training they send you to.The only problem is with management, the management at the three Ryder shops i have worked in run it like its military and you can not do that in a civilian work place."
good,The job is ok. It has it good an bad. I stay an hr an ten mins away. My biggest issue is the mileage. I like the job i do. The people i work with are nice and polite. The job rewards you when you do a good job and no safety issues.
good,"El trabajo en equipo era un poco desorganizado, pero  siempre trataba de adaptarme tanto al equipo, como al supervisor para que las cargas salieran a su tiempo, la presión de trabajo era excesiva aprendí a adaptarme a este ritmo de trabajo, el compañerismo era agradable. Aprendí como cargar y descargar refacciones pesadas al igual a como manejar un montacargas. El único detalle era el sueldo pues no era suficiente para mi sustento. Lo que mas gustaba de este trabajo era que descansaba dos días a la semana."
good,"Had an awesome teammate to work with, work day was good except for the long shifts i had to put in. i didn't learn anything cause i did all the same thing on my previous job before this one"
good,Fast pace which I like. Room for advancement. There is nothing hard about the job in my opinion. Fun place to work. I learned a lot dealing with shipping and receiving.
good,"Good job, unexperienced management.  This is the company you want to work for if you like to spend time at home with the family."
good,"Very Flexible hours, sometimes get to go out on the truck with the drivers and help deliver Xerox machine and put them together. Good opportunity to meet good people while out on the field."
good,Large shop to work in. Lots of broken trucks. Shifts change unexpectedly. No sense of organization. Lots of room for improvement. Many technicians coming and going.
good,I've been working since October of 2018bi started there as a tamp to hire and got hired in March of 2019 it's a nice place. They make sure everyone is working safely and they always have work for for us and overtime is always available to us. They have ok health insurance and 401k .when there is something new coming up they always keep us updated on it
good,Great place to work due to the management and drivers. Pay is below whiat others doing same type of work recueve. Insurance is poor co pays are very high before insurance helps
good,Ryder runs very lean and it's hard to replace people when they leave. People are very reluctant to change and very few have a true understanding of their own role.
good,Great place to work due to the management and drivers. Pay is below what others doing same type of work do. Insurance is poor co pays are very high before insurance helps
good,Quick and Fair advancement if you work for it. Location is going through changes than could of been planned out better. Management jumps to change things without a clear plan on how do so.
good,"This job was extreamly stressful, especially in peak season. It consisted of extream back to back answering the phone for customers and the truck drivers to resolve their issues. Once the new girl gets the hang of it they leave her to do all the work. The two head co workers were very rude. However, the pay did get raised by 3 dollars. And there are a lot of benefits such as health insurance. 401k,and paid time off. Really not enough workers for the amount of calls and work."
good,"Ryder has helped me grow, and has given me opportunities i do not believe i would have received elsewhere. I could not see myself working here for longer than 10 years due to the lack of work / life balance."
good,"Company offers great benefits including healthcare, dental, vision, option to buy into Ryder stocks, 401k. They have multiple locations worldwide. Multiple opportunities in different departments and locations."
good,"Mostly I didn't like when my hands got cold. Work wasn't too hard, most people easy to get along with. Gave hams out on Thanksgiving. I liked rotating every 30 minutes so if you didn't like one thing yuo didn't have to do it very long."
good,A lot of knowledge I gained here in this company. One of the best employer also in Canada. The benefits are very good. A lot of room to grow in this company.
good,"Benefits are good. Work is easy. Management has plenty of ideas on how to make it better but not much in the way of execution of those plans. It might get better but not for a while. All of us were told it was going to be a M-F weekends off schedule and that’s why they got so many applications and the first orientation class was huge. Most of the drivers are leaving slowly, due to the schedule and the way dispatch handles things."
good,No one is breathing down your neck.  You have a lot of down time. The hardest part is dealing with management that hasn't had any experience in managing.
good,There is a little drama but when management finds out about it they go ahead and handle it the professional way. We get paid 8.25 an hour which is good but I get paid every two weeks.
good,I was previously on the Rite Aid account. It was minimal at best. They said I would make 63k a year doing doubles. I barely made 50 my first year. I have since transferred to another account. I'm now home every night and make decent money hauling milk. Management is really great on this account.
good,Ryder Logistics was a fun place to work at once you go use to your job. Sometimes it could be stressful if you were picking parts for the outbound department.
good,"work culture is great and all."
good,tener un buen  aviente de trabajo ser responsable con mislabores de trabajo
good,"productive and a team leader!"
good,"Great place, nice people.  Would not leave, but Ryder closed department."
good,I enjoyed working with all of the people at Ryder. The management team was more than helpful when it came down to working around my schedule for school and encouraging me to finish.
good,I worked over 300 mandatory OT hours for a year and only grossed 1200 over my base pay.  The pay structure based in Miami actually pays you less an hour after you work 12 hours overtime -
good,Great place to work. Employees become family. IF you are looking for an environment that you can have real access to your superiors and want them to listen to your concerns the this is the place to consider.
good,Outstanding company popular fast work pace environment Competitive pay overtime hours family friendly vacation paid sick paid time 401 k dental vision insurance
good,"Wearhouse and logistics work, unloading trucks an stacking product for AT&T for each individual location in louisville ky.  Fast pace environment , forklift driving, stretch rap product on pallets to load on to trucks."
good,Pues en si ryder es buena empresa lo unico malo son los salarios de hay en mas no tengo nada malo que desir de ella
good,"This job has taught me some serious time management.  Since I'm on my own at my locations, I'm held one hundred percent responsible for completing all tasks with precision.  This has helped me to become self driven under no supervision."
good,"As a Customer Logistics Coordinator the days are high paced and can be stressful. If you take the time to listen, you are able to learn and build towards your future. Good base salary. Terrible overtime pay. If you work overtime, you make less then than your hourly rate."
good,"Thousands of pounds in merchandise you have to unload every day, 6 days a week, no helper. "
good,I have learned a lot working at ryder thay taught me structer and how to be leader thay also teach you how to prepre for your next job and give you experience.
good,"Traditional values are enforced but moving towards becoming a modern company, new casual dress code across company. Work from home available sparingly."
good,Another horrible management job! Nobody is on the same page. the pay is decent and its cold  in the freezer. They give us old  cold suits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"ryder north haven I work there for few months its a good place to work but the only bad thing are the management because them that place keep losing employees and business once a coworker told me he worked in that place for almost 30 years and he had seen  almost 300 employees past tru that place and because    "
good,"Drove to different towns every day,seeing different types of animals all the time."
good,I arrived at my desk 20 minutes before 8:00 and I remained there until 4:30.  I was responsible for client insurance verification and setting up new customer files.  I learned computer skills.  Management was not always available.  My co-workers were in cubicles.  Sitting at my computer was the most difficult part of this job.  The most enjoyable part was knowing I learned computer skills.
good,I worked unsupervised but reported to my manager with weekly reports via spreadsheets including pivot tables. Worked in the finance department which is what I enjoy doing most. I had to make two weekly trips to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
good,el ambiente de trabajo esta muy despasio aveses ay salidas aveses ni pedimentos que recojer
good,"Worked driving flatbed...job was ok, hard work up and down off trailer securing load tarping and retarping load for multiple stop customers. Weather is a big effector of this job."
good,"A good company with well seasoned professionals, many areas within the company to work or transfer too, thus increasing advancement opportunities."
good,I 've worked here for almost 6 years unfortunately we will be ending this August of 2013. I've learned so much and have developed many of my skills that I have now.
good,I graduated from high school played AYSO soccer hours of Junior ROTC I made art paintings I was a decorator four prom I get along with others well at work in a group
good,Management sucks because all they do is lie. Told everyone that there is plenty of room to move up. Yet when a position opened they either didn't post it and handed the job to someone or hired outside the company. They play favorites. 2 people messed up 2 orders in the same way. One got a slap on the wrist while the other got a write up.
good,"Third-party logistics support staff.  Our group works well together for the most part. 5+ year veterans on first shift, younger groups on 2nd and 3rd shift that do not get the whole ""Taking Ownership"" of your work yet like the veterans do.  Some conflict when Ryder management plays favorites to specific people and tries to railroad or set-up others for failure by not believing anything they say.  The whiners get catered to and promoted while the people who buckle down to do the job get talked about stating they are mad all the time."
good,There is to much favoritism by the  manager it seems  that if he is your friend or you suck up to him he lets you get away with anything and he will put in a good word for you with his bosses despite your work ethic or knowledge also will give you job titles just because you are his friend so that you can get a raise even though there are employes that have been there longer and that position has never been needed and if you are a good worker you just get piled up with more work. Moved on
good,"Ryder is a great company overall, but the job that I work in logistics at a local account, there is little to no room for any advancement without moving very far away. Also, management is not easily accessible and you have no visibility anywhere else in the company."
good,The management staff is new and the culture has not yet been defined. There are a variety of shifts to work and plenty of room for advancement. The location is convenient.
good,Ryder is a reliable and stable Fortune 500 organization that offers good employment options and benefits. Ryder is an excellent company in which to advance a career in Transportation.
good,hauled vinyl for windows. drove new ferightliner casscadias. trailers were old too heavy could not haul shippers whole load that shipper wanted to ship. no active management in place.
good,Was the first place that i did work experience in and I enjoyed it a lot. I learnt a lot of skills that i normally wouldn't be accustomed to use in school
good,The supervisors work with everyone and understand when u call in sick
good,Working there was decent. Steady pace and nice people. Hours weren't too long. Nice place to work if you like working in warehouse setting. I tried it there for three years
good,"Kind of a meat grinder place to work. If it's a contract to hire role run! They follow budgets and if the project gets axed you do too! I got called on a Thursday to say it was my last day as the project got ""de-funded""."
good,This was a short contact job to help move personnel files from the cabinet to file boxes that were to be shipped to Dallas office.Ms jones was my mgr. who was very nice to work for. They payed very well.
good,I don't think it would be a fair review because of my current circumstances. I am going to go and address the company because I cannot give a fair evaluation. People make Ryder what it is not the upper management.
good,Ryder is a good company. I currently work for them.  My particular managers are not in touch which makes my job a little difficult at times but I manage.
good,"Friendly culture made the days bearable.  Horrible manager, with 0 people skills, made me quit the job without any notice.  Would never work for someone like that, ever again."
good,"I coordinate our outbound shipments. Drop all the replenishments for daily orders. Drop tasks, research shortages and communicate with customer service reps of any unknown shortages to the customer. Keep employees with a steady flow of work, and ensure drivers get in and out loaded in a timely manner."
good,It was an easy work place to learn but not a place that i would recommend for they do not send help when needed.
good,"I work in the tunnel ; production at a very fast pace, You learn to keep up with product coming out. its great working fast because it keeps me busy. My co-workers are my friends because we work well together. The best of my Job is knowing I did a great job at work."
good,Ryder is a good company to work for that provides lots of benefits. However some employees can make working here unpleasant. Also unless you are driven the job can become tedious and slow.
good,Buen trabajo pero algo de presion por parte de el cliente al cual le trabajabamos.
good,"con los compañeros el ambiente era bueno, con jefes, no muy bueno ps solo se encargaban de mandar no tenian la actitud de lider."
good,"I enjoy it being a fast paced environment, having positive helpful co-workers. Everyone is open & helpful. I was lost my first 2 weeks, but when I moved to first shift everyone was more easy going"
good,Ryder is a good company to work for  with good paying benefits. Some accounts are better than others. Not a team driver and do not like being forced to do so.
good,"Days can get a little crazy there, its always good to have a good team behind you. Unfortunately the management team cares more about advancing themselves than training their teams properly."
good,I have workes for Ryder for over 3 years. I have enjoyed my time here. Everyone seems to care about their jobs. Thw company goes out of their way to make you feel wwlcome.
good,"19 years at Ryder as class 1 hgv driver. Good company, has good reputation for service. Hourly rate ok but difficult to get enough work to make good money."
good,"Long Hours, 6 days per week. On call 24/7/365 days.  new metrics for everything.  outdated system, high expectations with unrealistic goals.  Pay is decent but not for hours that is needed to do the job"
good,In the beginning it was good.  As the business went on the normal things started to happen.  Like promises to get promoted and never happen. There was no raises for any one here.
good,"This place is okay to work, the worst thing is management. They really suck, and don't know how to work with the employees"
good,Working  there is good if you want to start off  a new carrer and take off hours are crazy tuesday - saturday 7am 330 pm  meet peopel from all over driving tractor trailer as you service them
good,"No training program and company lacked structure in place to succeed. "
good,Esemplare attività rivolta all'assistenza domiciliare di pazienti oncologici con dedizione e professionalità da parte di tutto il personale sanitario.
good,ryder is good i just didnt agree on most of the policies it seems like decition making was poor and no one is welling to make it
good,"The work environment is very fast paced. You are pressured to make and maintain rate with very little ramp-up time. You are expected to be at 80% your 2nd week on shift, which is not nearly enough time to learn the system."
good,"I've worked in manufacturing performing logistic, material scheduling as well as management for the customer General Motors for over 15yrs.  I am well versed in domestic and international scheduling as well as logistic routing.  For the last 7yrs I have had the honor of being the sole Manager with 45 employees working directly to me in which I was responsible for ensuring they met all customer expectations.  I was also responsible for hiring and disciplinary measures."
good,"Heavy truck mechanic, lots of pm work, wheel end( brakes wheel seals tires ), electrical, some engine work."
good,Very goos company to work for great benefits and pay very stressful environment co-workers are great hours are great the only thing is there ian't any opportunity for growth with this company and they do not offer training 
good,Over all a good place to work. Have been there for 13 + years but the thing that sucks is they do the raises as a company in whole not individuals. You could have one person that busts his but and another person who is paid the same and does little or nothing. But doesnt get reprimanded for it. Feel like your word doesnt count.
good,As a Ryder Employee I learn a lot from my manager she was a great lady that would teach you all about the system and policies and procedures so that you would succeed. We had flexible hours and as long as our job was done we could manage our time witch it was nice.
good,Great company with little growth opportunities based on closed minds. I learned a lot about time management and multitasking during the duration of my employment.
good,The job was good but management was new and didnt know how run they shift or the company inside kelloggs. If you like doing 12 hours its the place to be.
good,"You know what to expect when you show up everyday. Management treats workers with respect. Pension is admirable, but advancement is limited. Expect to work Saturdays on first shift of 2nd or 3rd shift for a long time."
good,"enjoyed working with other driver. 401K and stock are great. Medical was OK. "
good,It is a good company to work for. Full time positions available. Weekends off unless overtime available on Saturdays. Short on employees. Busiest time of work is summer.
good,"Each day had a different location to deliver to."
good,A little dysfunctional but a great place to work. How things are done are always getting changed. There is a serious lack of communication between management and employees. The atmosphere in the shop is unpredictable. One day everything is fine and the next everything is screwed up.
good,decent company to work for management was great also the benefits were horrible. nice to have a week off in summer and winter around Christmas. very family oriented
good,"Simple if you get onto equipment, management can be very unprofessional and favor certain employees overs for the wrong reasons. Pay is decent, hours are chaotic depending on what the factory is doing. Sometimes 8 hrs normal day, can quickly switch into 6 12hr days a week."
good,Ryder is a great company to work for.  The health care could be better they do not offer plans that will work well for a family if you are young and single then the plans are for you.
good,The job was nice easy and I did what I had to do and worked hard I liked the hours I got but sometimes it gets frustrating when a lot of other coworkers don’t show and make your job mor difficult
good,"I drove a forklift unloading trucks with a clamp forklift. There was a lot of rules but not impossible to follow, very strict on attendance. I learned a scanning system attached to the forklift..Poor management. Adjusting to the amount of changes being made was hard to deal with. Driving the forklift was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Worked for them over 3 years and it was miserable jail time. The pay was good benefits were average. The accent for safety is way too much. If you want to play games and go by their policy book and follow all produres to make a simple service last half a day of work this is the place for you! I would not recomend any mechanics nor my worst ennemy to go turn wrenches at any Ryder Truck Rental location. Managent are liars and back stabbers.
good,La empresa. Me a enseñado muchas cosas las cuales me servirán. En  mi vida futura pero no es muy buena para crecer. Laboralmente
good,"Most of the systems still need attention and work to ensure stability.  There are many highly qualified people on each team, but few steps can be made to advance due to multiple constraints."
good,"A good place to work but could be better with a few changes. Need better pay, communication and the ability for employees to be promoted. Management Team need to accept feedback from the employees."
good,I learned a lot about logistics and managing people daily. I was able to display my problem solving skills and gained the opportunity to teach in a classroom environment.
good,While working for Ryder I have and still continue to achive multiple tasks that change on a daily bases. Ryder has given me the oppertunity to advance my experiance with production management.
good,the job and company are great but I have not a lot of home time working 14 hour days n now I am being told we will have to start working Saturdays as well in which will cause me to go over on hours allowed by DOT to work. I am paid .39 cents a mile and 15 dollars per drop which isn't bad if I had a lot of drops but that's not possible with the miles and areas I deliver to due to the time it takes to get there and back.
good,Have a run between Henderson and Longview.  Home daily.  Drive 350-400 miles a day.
good,"Oversaw 5 locations with 1200 units, 64 employees"
good,Transportation industry leader that was in a very big growth mode while I was there.  Very respected company where accomplishments were rewarded with opportunities and good compensation.
good,"The position I held was great. I had very clear goals daily to meet and the drivers I worked directly with were very nice and fun to talk to. My direct manager was a very outgoing fun guy but let his personal life get in the way of his professional life far to much. A lot of my job was having to make sure I kept my manager on track and focused. Also, my manager would come to me to complain about his management which I felt was extremely unprofessional and not OK. I learned to keep my own thoughts on his personal life quiet as it was not my place to tell him how to better balance his home and his work."
good,Hardest part of the job was getting all the work done with minimal staff
good,I've mostly enjoyed my years with Ryder and i've been on some pretty good paying accounts  and worked with some fine managers but unfortunetly that's not the case right now.
good,Its a ok place to work management could be better great co-workers
good,Good thing about Ryder is they are a by the book company and they have strength in numbers. Very safe company to work for. They provided me with classroom knowledge of proper preventative maintenance. Not very good at maintaining hours that you work. For example one week you will work 45 hours and the next you will only get 35 so they can average your time out to the basic 40 hours a week. Constantly changings schedules with our without your knowledge. Reason for leaving Ryder is they had a mass hire which is good because people need to work. But the people that had already been there they cut hours to part time for budget adjustments on there part.
good,"if you can work at ryder you can handle any job, fast paced work environment"
good,"I loved my actual job but was less than happy with the ""politics"" of the entire situation. I was also disappointed that additional training was not more accessible. I tried several times to attend additional training but my managers were unwilling to adjust the schedule for me to actually attend."
good,I started as a temp and transitioned to the company. The hiring process was supposed to be about 3-12 weeks as a temp but I was a temp for about 5 months.
good,"A very fast pace friendly environment, constantly moving equipment and inventory around for our consumer. A typical day was challenging but fun an I had Great Co workers bon that site"
good,"Ryder is a good company to work for. It is a fast-paced, high energy environment. It is centered in the heart of spring hill at the GM assembly stamping plant."
good,The company would be great if they invested more into the technicians and keep up with the tools in the shop but that also falls on part of the technicians in the work place
good,Ryder is one of the best jobs I have ever had but it can become super demanding and there’s little compensation for all the hard work. It’s a little discouraging.
good,"It was a quick pace job"
good,You have to put in the work here at Ryder in order to separate yourself from your peers. It comes down to quality of life and if you are in a position to sacrifice more in order to achieve more.
good,It's a decent place to work provided the supervisors aren't nit picking everything you do. The UAW is ok at best. Biggest issue is being stuck in a contract where you no longer receive raises.
good,"None to mention"
good,"Fast paced, and many customer incentives to fill. Working in the Victoria location can be challenging due to not only are you working as a mechanic but you have to fill the role of service advisor, parts personal,and porter. If you can multi task four jobs and don’t mind being on call 24/7 one or two weeks out of the month. Then it’s not bad. But no room to grow ."
good,While working there it was okay but there was tons of swing shifts. Going in from 6pm-6am one week then 12pm-12am the next. It was hard to get an accurate sleep schedule. Job comes with little communication and becomes stressful when shuttles come in with mixed material.
good,"Ryder was one of the most consistent companies I've ever worked for, which is hard to find in an industry that's always changing. The loads were not too heavy, and the pay was pretty great."
good,Ryder is a good place to work. They have a really strict guidelines when it comes to safety. Sometime the safety regulations are counter productive. It was a fun place to work.
good,Ryder is a good company to work at good pay if you willing to work do your job be on time have good relations with customer vacation time off on holiday
good,I worked at ryder for almost a year and it was good. Lots of good people who work hard and until they changed things alittle it was one of the better places I've worked besides not getting paid near enough.
good,"I loved a lot of my fellow co workers and my immediate supervisor was fantastic, there were just some bad elements who worked there who did things that were shady and for whatever reason even when caught got away with it. "
good,It was annoying having to stop what I was doing to do something else. Pay was not that great but it paid the Bill's for the most part. Was hired for the morning shift but was moved to mid shift.
good,"Es buena pero el personal no ayuda mucho, además de que se valora poco el esfuerzo."
good,Good place to learn a lot of things.  Some days are good but if there isn't much work they can send you home early.  All you can do is just take one day at a time.
good,"While I was there the work is consent state of flux, it either too busy or not enough"
good,Great coworkers but lack of backing by management. No room for advancement. No pay increases over several years. Work load was too much for one person.
good,"I worked there for a few years as a owner operator. I would run the West coast and back East on a regular bases. I hauled Auto parts, Chemicals. Produce, and many other products. I used a dry van & refrigerator vans."
good,"You do work long hours depending on the route you get but it changes every month.  For new hires you don't get very good routes meaning longer days and the routes are distributed or I should say you bid on them every month and the bidding is based on seniority. The pay is good, you have a guarantee pay per week or mileage and stops, whichever pay is higher.  The equipment is ok, sometimes you get a bad trailer but, that doesn't happen very often.  You are in the same truck every day even though you share a truck with another driver depending on the route. The trucks are generally kept in good condition.  If you do breakdown, they do try and get to you with in a reasonable amount of time due to this freight is always ran on-time. Their are extreme cases where a driver has sat for multiple hours but that only happens in extreme circumstances.  All 3 locations are at Ryder Shops and fuel locations and in most cases they try to work on your truck as quickly as possible if they can't get it fixed in time, you are given a rental truck. Most trucks are 2012 and newer.  On this Team, you don't have trucks over 800,000 miles.  Most trucks have Cameras in them facing driver and Traffic but they are only activated during road incidents like following too closely or hitting brakes to hard.  You do get to be home every day or night depending on your route but the longer the route is, the less time you are home.  All freight is no touch and depending on your bid, you may just have a drop and hook route.  The only downside to the freight is you do have to check it off and fill out a lot of"
good,typical warehouse job. shift was firm. overtime was voluntary. easy to navigate the warehouse matrix. good mix of stuff you could do. the only problem really was the top out pay scale.
good,"Nice people, but workload expectancy is definitely greater than what they are willing to compensate financially.  Management definitely makes more money, but the ones who do the menial work do not."
good,Productive place to work at. I still question some of the leadership at the company and the direction they are headed due to management.
good,"Small company great CEO. Good morale and the opportunity to learn more about the industry was superb. However, long hours and lack of benefits were a downer. Great Part Time or entry level job."
good,"You can do the right thing, be 100% safe, be ontime, have driver of the month, and as soon as a small disagreement occurs with a customer, to the bricks you go.. unfortunate there's no such thing as job security or loyalty to your workers anymore."
good,I'm topped out on pay scale with no room to move up.it was great starting out but became very over worked with no overtime.
good,"Being a service manager at Ryder location is a fast paced, challenging environment, must be able to adapt and resolve issues related to customer needs and special requirements as they arise."
good,"I Derick Pahlad started at Ryder Logistics Transport last year April/2014, as a Fuel island attendant. I was a temp working for Allstaff placement agency. My duties consisted of inputting correct data into handheld computer regarding the amount of fuel dispensed into truck, customers name, drivers name and mileage in order to calculate the correct figures. I would assist the licensed mechanics in performing part changes on trucks, cutting spare keys, keeping the shop in tip top order to create a safe and friendly environment for the Mechanics and Lube Technician. I learned how to grease important parts and change truck oil and filters on big rigs. I would take down inventory information and forward it to our parts manager who would finalize and order supplies in advance to eliminate downtime. I would fill up oil and coolant containers along cutting spare keys and any other necessary duties that may be required from a entry level Technician. I really enjoyed working at Ryder but my contract term was extended as far as I was needed."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the pay was great, with plenty of bonus room. If you want to you can make great money there. the coworkers were very friendly and nice."
good,Ryder is a trucking company that has taught me a lot about transportation. I have learn a lot about the trucking business & business it self. the last department I worked in a typical day was making appointments for customer to bring their trucks in for service or taking calls for break downs. I started employment with this company in 1989 and management was different from 2000 management. I have learn a lot from co-workers and I was told you never work hard if you like what your doing. I enjoy meeting all type of customer and there need for all types of vehicle and being there for them when they needed me.
good,"Enjoy working with clients and providing them with solutions."
good,"Ryder Ltd are a global fleet management company. The duties I carried out were not to the qualifications I have, therefore I had to learn by myself how to carry out the role to it's full potential as my manager was pre-occupied with other jobs."
good,"Great co-workers, plenty of great ideas and potential. Had a lot of opportunities and development while with them."
good,"I worked in all departments. Shipping Lead, Receiving Lead, Inventory. Drove all equipment. Reach, Cherry Picker, Walkie Rider (single and double) Clamp, Forklift (sit down)."
good,I liked driving for them but when I was injured they fired me by letter not a nice way to let someone that is hurt to fined out they can't take care of there family 
good,"My position as Vehicle Sales Representative is very demanding. You have to pay acute attention to detail and stay extremely organized. In my opinion, the workload outweighs the pay. We ran a 2-man operation and I was required to do/know just as much as the manager but was not paid as such. As long as you do your job, there is good security within the company. There is room to grow as they like to hire from within first. One of my personal favorite incentives was training in Miami...Good vacation!"
good,"Potential for growth with great relocation options throughout the United States. Benefits include paid vacation days, paid holidays, insurance, and 401K options."
good,"Seniority rules first off.. so no matter how good you are, efficient, whatever, guy that's been there the longest will be promoted before you are for sure, cannot speak for every location, just the one I was at. Also there was a HUGE issue with management and revolving door office employees. Only consistency were dispatchers. Upper management were changed out once a year for crazy reasons.kindskinds o"
good,"Good place to work on the whole but it depends on the role you do. I am a pool driver and I dont believe I get enough money for the amount of work, last minute organisation and stress I get put through. Was good at 1st until you stand up for yourself and then they have little ways of getting 1 over on you."
good,This place has a good work environment. They provide you with all the training you need in order to work on the equipment they have. Different variations of vehicles to work on.
good,Good job. Works with your school schedule. Allows time to spend with family. Great benefits. Easy job. Alot of overtime. Supervisors are nice and understanding.
good,"Fun place to work, an what made the job real enjoyable was having the ability to learn something new every day I went to work.  The people employed through Ryder help make the work place more enjoyable."
good,I wish I had more of a security job not contracted through other companies. No future raices. It's more of a day-to-day job I see no future more of a drive
good,I enjoyed my job .Glad I had the chance to work for rider .maybe in the future if given I would work for Ryder again .They had good equipment and  great pay .
good,It was a good company. Staff was friendly and respectful . Work was very busy good schedule. I would refer cdl holder to work for the company. The work was enjoyable to do.
good,I was charged with bring forth new business opportunities. As well as maintaining a current book of business. Ruder is a great company to work for. A lot of opportunity within the industry.
good,Would be a great place to work. Not saying Ryder as a whole company. Just the yard I work at. Manager won't do anything to the laziness of other workers. Which makes the others do more work. This I'd totally unfair and I've had enough of it.
good,"Great Group of People, employees and employer , Great Place to Work Management was always willing to work out with you,  up and coming problems personal and work related."
good,"Friendly and supportive staff, and management including HR. Heavy labor in very hot environment most of the year. Lots of lifting and bending. Jobs as auditor was good but should be a 2 person job. One to do auditing and one to load & wrap pallets."
good,The opportunity at Ryder was perfect. I was able to work 2 jobs which was very rewarding. Ryder worked with me providing me with a 3rd shift and teaching me a new skill
good,Working at Ryder was an okay job I didn't really care for management they were very unprofessional and they were they played a lot of favoritism with older employees that has been there with a little more seniority also they seem to be a place that you work really hard for and you put a lot of time in at the end of the day they'll stab you in your back and just let you go writer I will probably give them a three-star just because the the pace the the pay was decent and the job was not hard other than that I would not recommend writer
good,"Todo excelente, uno que otro coordinador que es muy ojete"
good,Delivered groceries and supplies to stores and warehouses.  I learned about how the grocery business works.  Great  drivers to work with.  Great employees at the stores.
good,"The people there under management are great, hard working people. Great to get along with. I learned a LOT about Supply Chain Management. Wonderful atmosphere."
good,"Had a relay run M-F. All weather. Equipment ok. Freighliners (newer), 53' trailers not so new. Affordable benefits and decent discounts on various services and products."
good,"It is a hard job because you require of forklift skills a lot at time to unload and load your flatbed trailer, it feels a lot of stress because your load is a high value and dangerous so the pay it could be better but you have overtime guaranteed every week!"
good,Be ready to work. Nice boss and good pay. Anybody can do this job same thing all day long .the guys get to work together and the then finish the job .good job
good,"It's not Ryder that makes me CRAZY...It's the company that I'm assigned to deliver for that makes NO SENSE in it's actions OR thinking."
good,"Ryder was a very good company to work for a lot of great people, willing to help you when you need it. great pay and a great benefit packet. i left to pursue another career path but i would go back in a heartbeat"
good,I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone especially if you have bills and a livelihood that you have to keep up with. Lay offs are real critical with this job. Sucks to go to work and worry about trucks being available as well as loads.
good,Management does not address problems that drivers have. Overall they seem like a good company to work for. But often it would take small amounts of effort to make most drivers happy. But they overlook the opportunities to make this happen. Little better listening by local management. And easier access to corporate HR and upper management would be helpful.
good,I’m sure it would be better if you weren’t dealing with the lack of consistency of Chrysler. Overall I like my position here the work is easy but  the rapid decline in hours recently is unacceptable.
good,Hours go up and down but increase tremendously during the holidays would still work there if warehouse wasn't closing. co workers where good had a few bad apples.
good,Very exciting place to work learned a lot  about the space program pulled parts for the building of rocket engines shipping these  completed engines is very detailed work no mistakes allowed
good,"I would go in get my load , call my person of contact to see were where we going to meet and drive to change trailer .my whole day was any were from 9 to 14 hours depending on weather and driving conditions."
good,"Many dept within, good management team for the dept(I/C - Inventory Control) that I am in. Wonderful working environment, good working culture. Little slow for those who wants or seeking for progression within."
good,Ryder was nice place to work at. The management could do some improving.  Great Place for advancement. mangers are willing to work with you. Co workers became family.
good,It was an ok work environment. Very fast paced. I worked there for a while and I did enjoy my time working at 100% everyday. I wouldn't go back however because at the same time the management was very poor.
good,A typical day of work consist of checking loads for transport and making it at a reasonable time frame. I learned it was all about the miles to more you run the more you receive. The dispatching crew was awesome too. The hardest part of the job was learning the new work places. And what I enjoyed the most was the pay.
good,"Lots of opportunities for promotions.  The work life balance could improve, but they do promote a lot from within. Management is supportive of career development."
good,"Appreciate the time there. Helpful stepping stone. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and I appreciated the company's efforts to instigate a sense of togetherness with sponsored meals, and events. They are also good at donating to charity."
good,Not very family friendly your start times are never the same and you don't know until the day prior.  You start anywhere between 2200 and 0500 but you are home every day
good,Ryder is/can be a wonderful and fun place to work if you get on the right team. Everybody can't be worked under and they don't have your best interest at heart.
good,Not a bad place to work. Generally slow paced with times of fast pace. Nothing super hard to learn for their warehouse system of shipping and receiving or order pulling and issuing
good,"Good company but can be stressful. Looking for a job closer to home with better work,life balance. Looking for smaller workshop. Would recommend Ryder as a good employer"
good,"The company came with a new pay scale that on gave raises yearly for everyone that started working there after i did.  Everyone that started before kept the old pay scale which received quarterly raises, but everyone on the old pay scale slowly got laid off including me."
good,"Management was easy to work for and laid back. Had the opportunity for advanced training from manufacturers. Typical day was servicing, repairing, and fueling trucks."
good,the good part about working for ryder was  the level of unsurpassed professionalism that they offer. to be part of the ryder culture was a good experience..  the downside is that its somewhat difficult to advance within the company.
good,"Good logistics company to work for."
good,"Inbound Stow (Current Employee) –  St. Louis, MO – April 7, 2017"
good,"was a good industry to learn about.  alot of good people there.  very relaxed place to work.  alot of good networking to be done, since you deal with large companies."
good,Fast paced work environment and never a dull moment. Always truck to work and trailers to work on. Have to be personable with drivers and supervisors.
good,"Always find things to keep me busy, work environment is nice, I enjoy my job and like the people I work with.  I have learned a lot about steal reconciliation."
good,Started at company as truck washer/fueler. Worked hard everyday and when a tech position became available company saw my hard work and work ethic and trained me as diesel tech
good,"Regularly scheduled job, nice people, various jobs available, night shift is not for me. Would recommend company for people who like various shifts for work."
good,"Work hard and fast. Slow if not any advancement at all in the company. Never time to train personal to do new things. Great team work. Friendly and helpful co-workers. Management Driven by need to meet high volume shipments, sometimes having personal working 12 hour days, seven days a week for multiple weeks at a time."
good,I like the laid-back working environment at Ryder. The good thing about working at Ryder is the reputation as a leading logistics provider in the whole world. The downside is the opportunity to move up to management is relatively limited.
good,"Cant complain love working for ryder. Great co-workers including management. The pay at that time was good, overtime hlped alot. The route was nice. Clients were easy going."
good,"Geat company to work for.Benefits are good , people are good to work with.We are always learning different things about the trucking industry.Also they have a good 401 savings plan."
good,Good company. Plenty of opportunity for advancement. Pay is fair. Great place to work to learn the industry and develop for many different positions in and outside the company.
good,I received a very valuable education working at Ryder. Everyday was different and fast paced. I was fortunate to work for some great accounts and for some great managers.
good,"Typical day at Ryder would be simply get your reach truck clean check maintenance and then you get started picking things up and putting them away. Safety is always first, especially at jobs like this one."
good,"Be willing to come in with an open mind and always put your best foot forward, with that said, the worst part of the job is that customers will drive demand with high volatility."
good,"Its been several years since I have worked at Ryder, and have nothing negative to say about the organization. Everybody works really hard to make ends meet"
good,A typical work day was 7am-330pm mon-fri. Money paid the bills. Very repetitive work. Nothing too hard. Management was nice. Turnover rate is high. Good job..
good,"As stated in the summary, I work through Ryder at a specific contract they hold with Xerox. Great company, Manager was good, people were good too! I was a driver and worked 14 hours a day, 5 days a week. Lots of work, great pay there."
good,Had a wonderful onboarding experience with Ryder.  Centralized training and great managers.  The HR process is a headache and ridiculously out of step.
good,It was fun and a learning process environment however can still do better. A journey of unexpected people and unorganize workload somehow gives us a chance to be independent and responsible towards our  job.
good,Start off you night of whatever time of day you are working with speaking with you forman about what needs to be fixed for the night and then go and begin your job.
good,Fast paced work where management only cares about numbers. Good pay but comes with down side. You only get vacation days. No sick or personal days to take when you get sick. If you are sick more then one day you have to go to the doctors or you receive multiply occurrences and you can only take one vacation day to make up for missed days. If you get 9 occurrences in one year you are terminated. They are no fault occurrences so if you are in a car accident or you find yourself in the emergency room by no fault of your own your still get an occurrence. Heath insurance has huge deductibles. Breaks are 10 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch. If you are a smoker you must leave the property to smoke. You cant even smoke on the property. They like to write people up and have a high turn over rate.
good,This position gave me much experience of working with trailers and training. It was also a very stressful environment because every job had a designated time.
good,Ryder logistics as a workplace is intensive. You must be able to work independently as well as with a team. Attendance is key as you are part of a small team and missing a day with no warning can be crucial for over all team efficiency.
good,Ryder excels in providing customer service in Logistics and Transportation.  The Company has presence in all of the United States and many international countries.
good,"While working at Ryder  I learned about refer units and how to couple"
good,Very Laid Back Establishment and not hard work You are expected to be a independent worker. They let you come in on a choice of two different schedules of your choice
good,"Great company to work for, very talented work force that has the  ability to deliver complex customer solutions in Distribution Management, Transportation Management and Dedicated Fleet Solutions"
good,"the best part of the work environment here is the people you work with. The work is not easy and can be physically and mentally draining, but your fellow workers make it a great place. "
good,The rental management position requires you to take lead in a lot of different roles in order to have a successful work day. You have to be able to work with different departments within your location in an effective manner.
good,Actual job duties did not match job description at time of hire.  It was the only job I have ever had where the manager gets mad at you for showing up early ready to work.
good,the hours were great. pay was nice as well. Enjoyed 1st shift a lot. wonderful supervisors and managers there. Co workers were to easy to get along with.
good,High energy work place. Learned a lot about truck fleet leasing. Management was great and all departments worked well together. The hardest part of the job was escalating accounts to legal. most enjoyable was talking to the customers.
good,Good company to work with it.  It provides good support ans benefits.The company also provides lots training and employee has much better opportunities to get promoted to next level position.
good,"I loved working at Ryder and all the room to grow with the company.  I had 1 manager that I adored but he is no longer with the company.  I held 3 different positions while at Ryder,  I grew with the company quickly. "
good,Ryder is a great company to work for. I have learned a lot in my career here and grown both professionally and personally.
good,"Over all good work environment."
good,The call volume and logistics required could be daunting but once I learned the most efficient way to complete what was required I was able to enjoy the work and the great people that worked there.
good,"Ryder provides excellent benefits for it's employees, and shift schedules to fit various needs. They offer competitive wages for the area."
good,I was with this company from the very beginning. I experience all the growing pains and learn a great deal. My dedication was rewarded with trust and decent pay.
good,the managers are very supportive manner and welcome the innovative ideas. a good environment to grow up the supply chain engineers
good,"Duties include: Operate handheld scanner, maintain and service rental vehicles, fuel and check tire pressure, gas mileage and usage, communicate with customers regarding service."
good,A regular day at work here would consist of alot of table loading but would eventually would include scanning and organizing goods. I learned how to use a scanner. My coworkers were very supportive as well as flexible so whenever I couldn't make it they would be able to back me up. The most enjoyable part was scanning the goods while the hardest part was filling the tables and the skids.
good,"Ryder Integrated Logistics and Truck Rental company is very strong  in the North America, Europe and China. It was good working there."
good,Ryder is the place to be if your looking for experience to become a leader and will prepare you to take on greats role any place else.
good,Looking for more opportunities within corporation. Ryder has been a good experience and learning opportunity. Very strong customer service culture and very safety driven corporation.
good,"Best things about Ryder was the fellow employees, hour lunches, and multiple breaks.  Relatively easy job from day to day."
good,"Ryder Home Delivery is a small company located in Oklahoma that operates a variety of ""last mile"", delivery services to their customers. "
good,"This company's success is based on the talent, commitment, service-focus and ""find a way to get it done,"" competencies of its employees.  There are many ways to grow a career at Ryder, especially if mobility is flexible."
good,"its good how to deal with issues in here. but this companydont have union and they care only for money for the company, holiday pay but some times you have to work."
good,"Empresa muito boa, prestativa quanto aos funcionários, otimo ambiente de trabalho e funcionários capacitados."
good,"Ryder, all in all, is a great place to work. Its is a challenging fast paced environment that is open to new ideas and encourages innovative and ""outside the box"" techniques from its management staff when the stock price is high. The company seems to be in a transition period and in the process of redefining itself. There is definitely a rift between the older style of management of boss/employee vs. team leader and team. Some areas of the company have better results due to the team leader/ team approach as all the employees are engaged and have tons of buy-in. Unfortunately, when the market dictates cut backs due to stock price fluctuation the environment changes, projects get put on hold, or scrapped and upper management  reverts back to boss/leader mentality which negatively affects morale and stifles any progress previously made. If Ryder could manage to follow the course, not fearfully react to market prices, and proceed with what is best for the customer, the fluctuations in stock price would stabilize and create an overall better work environment for its employees in my opinion."
good,"Ryder is a good company that has taken care of me. They took good time to train me, which was especially nice since they typically do not hire inexperienced civilian drivers. I drive regional, so I will usually get told a day or two before I leave what my route schedule is and what day I leave. I will go in that day, get everything in my truck that I need, start it up, and log on to the logbook computer and start putting in my route information. I move strictly metal roofing products as we have a dedicated account out here with only one customer. Driving for Ryder is a good job. Its good honest work, and it pays decent. It can be hard though as you get part depending on stops and miles so shorter routes mean smaller paychecks. The hardest parts of the job are being away from my wife and two young kids several nights each week and the lack of predictability. A lot of times I don't know my route until a day, maybe two before. That makes it very hard to plan life around it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the solitude and the beautiful scenery I get to see sometimes. I learned a lot about driving a 10-speed manual transmission. I knew a little bit how to drive one in the military, but I learned way more with Ryder. I also got to learn about logbooks, hours of servce, DOT reules and inspections, and weigh scale procedures. None of these are part of driving in the military."
good,It's been over 10 years since I've worked there but there are still people working there from 20 years ago when I started. The shared services center offers many positions from entry-level to management. Definitely room to move up the ladder.
good,Training their employees is a top priority at Ryder. I definitely learned the necessary skills to be successful in my career from Ryder.
good,"Nice People, Long Hours, Lots Of Over-Time, Busy Most Of The Time Some Down Time And Long Days and Union . Hardest Part Of The Job Was Standing 12 Hours With No Sitting AND changing Tugged Battery"
good,"Ryder is a very large company and each location provides room for growth. Every day presented a new challenge which gave the opportunity to learn. Working 5-6 days a week, you become very close to your team."
good,"Could use new management."
good,Ryder was a very fun place to work because it was fast paced and everyone had to be very interactive with each other in order to get what VW needed.
good,"Fun workplace with supportive management, I am currently the supervisor for swing shift, looking for a day time position"
good,"I really enjoyed my job here, but the downfall would be the lack of work. The morning is really busy for the first 3-4 hours, but after that there is literally nothing to do. I was constantly looking for work to do, whether it be cleaning or organizing something for my boss."
good,"long hours, but work was consistent so they went by quick."
good,"Management is always in chaos, there needs to be more organization and transparency when it comes to advancement opportunities."
good,"I work a swing shift at work and am looking for something similar. I work from 12:00 to 21:00.  I am a Logistics Analyst for Ryder under the Toyota account. I manage the majority of the routes.  I've learned an enormous amount of logistics based knowledge from working for Ryder.  My co-workers are good people, but occasionally I do have to pick up the slack.  It is hard to move up because in order to move up someone has to quit and that rarely happens around here."
good,"Boa empresa, quando havia cargos vagos dentro da empresa, a mesma dava oportunidades para os funcionários que ali trabalhavam;Nunca atrasou um pagamento"
good,"Management over all was good but in the more hectic shop there unrealistic exectations and many over worked Techs.  In many cases trucks were allowed to be sent out by the Manager after the technician stated the truck would break down.  The technicians were told ""As long as it's out of my shop""."
good,Ryder is a well established company with a solid reputation. I enjoyed my daily job responsibilities and served my employer well while I was employed with them.
good,"work environment, co-workers and place good.f they can provide schedule and requirements to work. salary  also really impressive"
good,great place to work very friendly people great benefits and pay great communication within everything they do always trying to better there employees
good,If there is any problem I have with this place is that the company doesn't believe in there people and experience means nothing unless you know someone who knows higher up in that company.
good,Ryder is an excellent company to work for. Good Management and nice people to work with.
good,"On the forklift most of the time"
good,"Great company to work for, with solid well defined processes for implementing new customers and vendors."
good,"My day to day task are simple ones, I would pack and ship customers order into one shipping container to meet the dims that were assigned to it."
good,"Assigned to perform maintenance on diesel trucks, checking oil, defective parts, tires, starters, brakes, and all aspects of the vehicle and replacing and repairing necessary deficiencies to ensure that the truck in safe and functioning properly to be put back in service."
good,"Staying physically fit while at work was an excellent benefit. I worked closely with a group of six to eight other employees, whom we all had to pay attention to details, or would have to start over to correct the displays built."
good,"Ryder was a pleasant place to work.  The workload was based on the skill level of the employee.  "
good,"Fast paced "
good,"Crazy busy day. sent car parts to VW in chattanooga, tn. managment was okay. most enjoyable part of the job was that it was different day to day."
good,"A typical day at Cardinal Health was fairly repetitive.  Come in, team briefing, get pick tickets and we picked until all orders were picked for the day.  It was a fair management team in place and they trusted us to do what was needed to be done.  I really enjoyed working with my co-workers there. There really wasn't anything hard about Cardinal Health, i guess the hardest thing would be knowing sometimes we couldn't leave until the last order was picked."
good,"I learned how to multi-task and flow between numerous different accounts/customer fields all throughout the same day.  I got a great deal of experience on how to engage with different support teams and their customers.  The hardest part of the job is helping the customers meet some of the more challenging shipping needs for critical freight, but that is also the most enjoyable part."
good,this was a great job but very unstable. we where bought out twice so it was very nerve racking not knowing how much longer our doors would be open.
good,"Busy environment, fast paced and demanding. I learned to pick orders using RFID scanner, and refilling and overseeing robot cells. "
good,"•	Actively search out new customers to generate business for our rental and leasing departments.   "
good,not a bad place to work over all competitive benefits and pay
good,"Shift started at 8.00 a.m. to 3.30 P.M. learnt a lot about day to day operations of a logistics company. My managers were friendly. Its usually a busy place so you really have to be on your toes, guess that's a good thing"
good,"It's the average warehouse experience at Ryder. The management is decent. Co-workers are the best part of the job, most are personable and indifferent and help for the day to pass."
good,"delivered products for CVS Rx in Florida area. Good work place, very nice staff."

good,I worked for company for 7 yrs.  I seen the company grow and fall over the time spent there.  Many things changed.  Some for the positive and some for the negative.  
good,"inventoried material on the dock, made up drivers sheets and thier routes for the day."

good,"Really Nice Job , Would be there if they had enough work for me"
good,okay place to work for. they will show new people how to do some repairs on the unit.
good,I got my first CDL license driving a bus. I transported students of all grade levels including Head Start to and from various schools. As drivers we also gained extra hours by signing up for various charters where schools and private customers rented buses for various needs.
good,Ryder is a very structured company that has to go the multiple processes to get anything done.
good,alwas having somthing to do there usully alwas loads to be picked n loaded it is a very fast pace working envirnment
good,a typical day at work starts for me by going i a see what i need to count for the day. Making all my adjusments as i go. I have learned if you help another department they will help you when you need it too. the co-workers are friendly and willing to help. i most enjoyed the people i worked with
good,"Ryder was a great place to learn the overall financial management for a global client. I gained experience in import,export, domestic, air and ocean freight."
good,"In my line of work I need to be prepared for anything. It is a feast or famine type day. I like my co-workers and are friendly to all. However, I do not encourage visiting. There is a lot of turnover in the A/P department. It is like any job. You have the complainers and the doers. The hardest part of the job is the low pay though we do have great benefits."
good,Loaded and unloaded truck for each route to be serviced. Filled out logs and run sheets while following DOT regulations. Made orders for their locations. Drove various size forklifts. Had little contact with management and co-workers. Adjusting to different and sudden work schedules was probably the most difficult part of the job.
good,"Install copiers, printers, move Xerox equipment, trained to use an escalera lifting device, load and unload trucks and deliver different types of logistics to various locations and deliver cases to various school systems on behalf of Scholastic Book Fairs.all of my co workers were friendly and helped make my work experience a better one"

good,"Buen sueldo, el horario muy bien y también la seguridad del trabajador..."
good,"If they would only stop with the micro management it would be a great company,and employees would not be trying to leave. Once you are on the radar it is only a matter of time before you end up having to leave."
good,We get a daily schedule. I know what is ahead of me. You have repeat deliveries.    Dispatch time 10:30to 2:30 but you know in advance.  Pay is decent hope to get increase after a year. Overtime balances out pay.
good,"Day to day operations pertain to LTL shimpents in a 3PL environment, from quoting rates, assigning carriers, ensuring on time pick up and deliveries. Ryder has been a great place to work. Ryders new departmental business model of a sales based role is not my desired work environment. Management  is not very trustworthy, and give you a false feeling of job security."
good,Not bad place but take it for what it is. Can be A lot of overtime. And A lot of it is last minute. Bosses are pretty easy going long as I do your job
good,Good place to work for with good benefits and training programs in place. Would go back anytime if I wasn’t put on second shift with a 1 day notice. Good company.
good,Good it's was pretty hard but I got money for my 2 kids and house bills so far  I miss Ryder I really really really recommend that job if you need help pay your bills and food
good,"Ryder is a good company to work for. If you want to make it your career it is important to align yourself with a seasoned vet to learn everything you can. National company means you can transfer anywhere across Canada, more opportunities"
good,"Ryder, like many other warehouses, lack decent communication, but are extremely strict on attendance. Once you prove you can work with no errors, they then think about teaching you something else"
good,A nice place to work if you are willing to put in the effort. Communication could be better coming down the line. But overall a good place to work. Unionized
good,They lied to get me in the door but I stuck with it and then it everything became routine it was very physical it kept me in shape the money was okay I got to be home more than I imagined ..
good,"Great career starter. Valuable experience. Able to learn a great deal about managing people, processes, and oneself. Ryder helped me pay for graduate school via tuition reimbursement. For that, I am eternally grateful."
good,Ryder was a good company to work for while pursuing my MBA.  They have very generous tuition reimbursement.  I was able to take classes at night while working 50 hours per week.
good,happy in CALIFORNIA  working at rail. everyone very nice to me. help get a transfer to FLORIDA. gave me a temporary job here. until i got a better one.WAS MAKING 21.50 AN HOUR IN CALIFORNIA
good,"Ok job not a career choice. Ok home time. Runs by seniority. Low man gets lousy work or forced to work runs. Pay is ok but could be a lot better. No union yet, not sure if it will help with benefits or better pay or more weekend offs."
good,Its ok benefits are iffy the job is ok the pay is not what it should be they employ just enough to get by and there is not a lot of communication with upper management
good,We have a lot of temps so this is something different getting to know different people daily. Also get to know the drivers and what they do daily. Work flow always changing.
good,Enjoyed working for Ryder.  Management / Supervision was generally easy to work with.  Benefits were fairly standard. The company offered opportunities for growth and advancement and offered tuition reimbursement.
good,Good money but management leaves alot to be desired. Loved the local runs and being home every night. Had to work every other weekend but that was fine
good,"Working at Ryder is  very Pleasant.  My Position as logistic coordinator requires that I perform  a variety of task daily ranging from  shipping, receiving, inventory replenishment of inventory and generating  orders and researching and updating status on orders. ."
good,Ryder is a solid company to work for with advancement potential. Healthcare is comprable. Supportive management leadership. The ability to start at an entry level position and work into senior leadership positions.
good,Ryder pays well and has a good benefit package. Management can be better. Short handed a lot which causes more work to be put onto the technicians there.
good,"It is a fast paced environment and depending on what account you are on I believe determines your success. I enjoyed my time on the supply chain side learning about logistics and supply chain within the GM account. I transferred to dedicated and managed drivers and moved a customers freight, I did not feel like the set up was the best coming from supply chain I also took a pay cut so after a year I felt I had to move on. But I would gladly come back to supply chain."
good,"fast paced environment was a plus for me"
good,IT was a descent job just crazy work hours no real balance between home life . a lot of unexspected schedule changes without warning they were going thru General Managers like crazy.
good,little supervision simple routes but seasons are up and down so job security is not reliable the pay is decent through centerline but not through ryder
good,I have been with Ryder almost 32 years love the componey And the work all ways a new challenge ever day working on trucks from other side of the us and getting to chat with the drivers and get to now about the trips and the truck also hew that like Ryder
good,"People are respectful, everyone is interested in achieving the company's goals by working independently but as a team. The marketing team is great! The only downfall I would say is that the job security is not the greatest."
good,"employee concerns slow to be heard, hot/cold working conditions. Yearly pay raises minimal.  Some managers very helpful, others too overworked to hear concerns."
good,Ryder is a great company only bad thing I can say is the lack of advancement. Once you come on as a Tech 2 you will never move up unless your friends with the supervisors. Was told to take all the recommended classes to move up to a Tech 3 as I completed all the recommended classes was given every excuse why I could not get promoted but on the other hand friends of the supervisor got the positions without taking the recommended classes first. You had to threaten to quit or transfer to get a raise.
good,Se necesita ser de planta para ser tomado en cuanta en el desarrolo laboral
good,"Depends on what your job position is you could operate a forklift, tugger or kit. Some areas are relaxed and laid back while others are very fast paced."
good,Great job with limited advancement opportunity. Good starting job to learn about the industry. Also working every holiday due to the account Ryder services.
good,"My time at Ryder was well spent, but the location I was located in had a high turnover of managers and employees. Miscommunication, lack of interest in employees from new managers, complaints would go unheard, etc. This job is good if you want to earn good money but you're gonna have to be an autonomous because management will be overloaded and stressed out. Otherwise, not as bad as other companies."
good,Enjoyed my time at Ryder. Managers are nice and l was well liked there because l like overtime. Not an 8 hour/day job. Loved coming home every nite and was close to my location. Pay was good as long as you worked 50+ hours .
good,Great place to work at the home time is great I enjoyed going home every day. I wish they would pay better and the benefits would also be better. I would recommend this place to people if you don't have many bills
good,Gave the opportunity to expand my driving skills. I was able to travel and got experience in other areas of the driving community. The hours were long and trips were hard. Wouldn't want to do it again
good,"Love the company, but the management is very poor.  Management blocked advancement opportunities.  Advancement isn't given by work ethic and knowledge."
good,"This is a fast growing and fast paced work place with minimal support. there are 2 extremes with Ryder, either no support to be successful or Micro Management."
good,"Fast paced atmosphere with industry leaders, working on solution development for customers."
good,"I enjoyed this job, but when scheduling out work loads the senior mechanics would not take instructions from me and would give me a hard time. Management didn't seem to care when I requested assistance with the situation."
good,"good company. several locations to choose from. offers alot of additional training, via classes and online classes. workplace culture is good, good place to work overall."
good,"En una excelente empresa, con prestaciones buenas a su nivel alto, aunque a mi gusto le falta desarrollar mas talentos y prestaciones de sus niveles medios y bajos."
good,Currently laid off it's a great place to work once I get my seniority in I just don't have the seniority to work during lay off so I'm currently laid off
good,the work is not hard at all is just that co works drag out the work day the mangers are really friendly just sometimes the labor planning makes no sense
good,"Get new jobs every day"
good,"Very interesting. Very fast pace, and very competitive. Upper management is only concerned with their bonus and don't really care about the lower employees."
good,Would continue to work with company but growth will not be considered. Overtime is good in till work stop and all employees are sent home without any notice.
good,I liked the job very much. Drove special needs children to and from school. The hardest was driving on icy roads in Chicago winters. Best part is the wonderful children. Workplace atmosphere was relaxed. Management was fair and helpful.
good,"My position with Ryder has allowed me the flexibility to participate in my daughter's school activities.  Although I may be on-call, most of the time, I can still have the time with my family that I haven't had at other places."
good,"Good starter company, hard to get promoted with limited positions. Great for getting your foot in the door learning the business with a fortune 500company"
good,Ryder is a great place to work. there are many things you can be certified in and move up in the workplace. one of the things I enjoyed the most was lunch
good,"Ryder isnt a bad company to work for, there health and safety mad wich isn't always a bad thing as everyone wants to get home in one piece, never had any issues with the company"
good,Overall t is a good job with room for significant career advancement if you are willing to relocate. It has moments of downtime throughout the day. Benefits are fair.  It's not as engaging as i like but we are an important piece in the company so you can take pride in that. Overall company workplace culture is good. Morale is low at the south Vegas shop though. The sense of teamwork there is low and coworkers aren't willing to give a helping hand in time of need. Nothing really hard about the job.That is actually a downer for me because its not challenging at all.
good,"I learned that hard work does pay off. I started as a fuel clerk and worked my way up to Office Supervisor. I reported to the controller, but pretty much ran the accounting department by myself while the controller completed his masters degree. "
good,Great culture. Decent benefits. Professional and very civil teams. Make sure you really enjoy the position and are very good at what you do before applying.  The learning curve is steep and there is not much time to learn.
good,Ryder consist of working hard the whole shift stacking pallets building boxes pulling orders etc. But I loved it Iike to work hard so it was a cool job for me
good,being laid off after only working with the company for 3 months hard to really give an accurate review.  The only thing I can say is it was pretty disheartening and there are unable to place me somewhere else.
good,Pretty easy work but but can sometimes get very repetitive and annoying. When switching shifts it can become very tight and compact. You have to take your shoes off Everytime you walk thru the mettle detector.
good,"Generally pleasant work environment"
good,I feel there tends to be less than qualified people in certain management positions that make procedures very difficult to follow. But in all it can be a positive place.
good,I love my position just the company could do a few things different. A lot of content changes so you have t learn to adapt quickly
good,"Very demanding and reliant on shareholder feedback.  If you're numbers aren't in order, very stressful.  If your numbers are in order, very stressful.  No compassion or personal involvement from upper management.  The exterior cosmetics and ascetic beauty are for all to see and the foundation is weakened by the lack of upper management's ability to see the forest in front of them."
good,"NOT an Ordinary IT Job so much experience to take away and great opportunities to learn and gain experience, never ending process here your always learning!"
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work and learn about new things."
good,Great company to work for. They promote work/life balance. Management listens to their employees. A lot of opportunities. Top fleet company. Appreciates it's employees
good,Ryder is a good place to work to start a career. There is a lot opportunity to grow and learn in the industry. Ryder is a big company so there is always room to grow in many types of work.
good,"The employee's at Ryder a among some of the most caring people in  the United States.  Many examples of volunteerism, charity, and support was seen during my brief sales career.  It is truly a company that cares about people."
good,"I enjoy the work I do at Ryder, we are kept busy and is a safe work environment. But its a pain to get promoted and raises are 2% a year. Benefits and great and they match your 401k up to 3%"
good,Ryder was a good company and they sold off the student transportation side of the company to a British company. Things began to change when I left the company.
good,Had many locations over the 22 years. I learned the right and wrong things our customers were looking for. The problems were we were not taking care of our customers like we needed to at the end of my time their.
good,Never a dull moment.  It is a fast-paced environment and always learning something new.  Employees are encouraged to participate in Kaizen events which allows for team-building and commitment to do the job right and on time.
good,"Good place to work, no room for advancement though. Been here 5 years, and the raises are terrible. Benefits are great though. I've learned a lot at this job."
good,"coordinate ship scheduled with combination of air and ocean shipments for troubled suppliers,  follow up to ensure that ALL suppliers ship to the schedule. Confirm old and new parts are in place to cover any upcoming work orders with changes to part numbers or quantity used.  I love the work atmosphere,  our team of people is like a big family, even on hectic days we still know how to make each other smile."
good,The job is a pretty basic logistics position. The pay and benefits are mediocre. Advancement opportunities are not good unless you're part of the corporate clique. A good job to get you to the next one.
good,"Although my time was short, i did enjoy learning about logistics. Supply chain management is different. I would try this type of job again."
good,Fun workplace with supportive management.  The commute and hours are what are wearing on me.  I love my job - hate the drive!!!
good,I enjoyed the experience I gained in the day to day environment and had great co-workers. The corporate politics I thought were difficult.
good,I enjoyed the time i spent with ryder on the Lennox account... the pay could have been better but the people at Lennox where awesome!
good,great place to work great opportunities for growth great teachers that are real!!!! THey make sure your welcome is worth while .. you make great friends and money
good,"Se me encomendo el cuidado y administraciòn de cuentas en dos ciudades de Coahuila."
good,"Ryder has a great program for on the job training of employees. Ryder has a wide variety of employees with different cultures and background."
good,"standard rate required on daily basis. "
good,They got me my placement with Ryder Canada and from their I was hired on.  Working with log books and payroll hours for the employees
good,This was a good company to work for until you get injured then depending on the severety there is a good chance they will find a way to terminate you
good,"Ryder is the most organized of all the logistics companies, however it is so large there is no human touch with employees."
good,"okay job. I was promoted 4 times. It took me 3years to get hired on. Supervisors can be rude. If you're a temp, they don't care about you."
good,Ryder provides a good opportunity to learn about the trucking industry. Contact with management is primarily over internet and phone. Information needed to carry out the job is available to those diligent enough to search it out. The hardest part of my job was finding out where to get information and then gaining access to it. My greatest satisfaction came with accomplishments.
good,"Perform repairs as needed to equipment, verify complaints and make repairs and test equipment out for safety factors to ensure vehicle safe for DOT regulations on the road."
good,great people and relationships with a lot of room to advance if you're driven. some upper management can be tough to work with.
good,The work day was fast paced to meet delivery deadlines my co-workers were productive and team players and the management was knowledgeable and helpful.
good,"Salary is below OEMs, but non-monetary benefits usually make up for it."
good,A typical start at 3:30 pm and end at 3:30 am. I learn that you had to keep up or you stood the chance of the load being late and every load after would be late also. the management on night shifts was excellent and the crew on nights were good as well. The hardest part of the job is when you first start on the job learning the location of each dealer and where the door is to deliver the parts to. The hardest  part of the yard work was learning were each trailer had to go and learning the routes and the times required for each trailer. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were ahead.
good,Awsome work ares and co-workers .as soon as we finifhed are work our boos would send us home early.
good,Nice place to work.  Great corporate culture. A lot of very tenured employees work at Ryder.
good,"Responsible for overseeing all aspects of the day to day operation form products delivered and shipped to orders picked, communicating with the customer and maintaing quality control. Documentation of products delivered and management of the team."
good,`Ryder is a fast paced full of life job where anything is possible to do there
good,"Arranging expedited shipments both Domestic and International. Review past du Purchase Orders,  Follow-up with vendors on status of these PO's.  Assist shipping with any out of the ordinary shipments.  Working with International vendors was very difficult due to the language barrier and due to these shipments coming via ocean and transit time was very lengthy.  However, it was very rewarding when you were able to work through the issues and get material delivered in time for production.  Worked well with both Management and Co-workers."
good,"Work directly with client on site."
good,good place to work but too much politics. I did not6 enjoy the gossio among all emoployees there.
good,"Good place to work ! they have a lot of good driver training programs inplace,"
good,Good place to work clean and structured enviroment. Everyone works as a team. Dependable management. Job is not hard I enjoy what I do.
good,Great company but was not able to relocate to advance within the company.
good,My typical day at work would consist of creating shipping schedules and ensuring delivery on all auto parts to Ford facilities around the world. I learned how to maximize truckloads and save money for the customers. My co-workers were great people to work with! Very friendly and easy to work along side of. The hardest part of the job for me was leaving but our facility was being closed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours I worked 0500-1430 daily.
good,"Typical day at work is nothing out of the ordinary. Co-workers are for the most  part easy to get along with and work together. The hardest part of the job would be having to work out in the elements, wind rain snow. As for the easiest it would have to be the repetitive nature of the job. Extremely routine."
good,"Researched invoices, assisted truck drivers. Scheduled deliveries and reconciled accounts."
good,"Uma boa empresa"
good,"hours okay"
good,"getting trucks for customers"
good,Class A Diesel Technician.
good,"Pre-trip look over load, throw straps to secure the load. Hook up the tlr. Make sure lights and the trk/tlr are in place and king pin locked in place. I have learned to be a team player,take responsebility for my actions,to do it in a professional way,and with a great customer additude. The hardest part of my job is to make sure that I have done everything right to do my job right,I enjoy what I do and meeting the same customers,and being able to provide a service . And at the end of the day I do a post-trip and uncouple the trk/tlr and park my trk"
good,I shipped out products that companies had ordered. I drove numerous forklifts. Was a team lead for about half of a year before leaving. Had a lot of good memories and good friends come from here.
good,Ryder is a great company to work for. Everyone works very hard and it is expected that each team member carry their own weight. Great place to learn/develop a wide range of skills.
good,"I have fun with all my co-workers, I learned the we can work like family, Management not that great but we pull the plug, my co-workers well the saying they i was like the Mayor everyone looks for me, They was nothing hard at this job,went i help on the fuel island was real nice........."
good,A typical day consist of first verifying any billing work needed and then verification of administrative work needed. I begin logging in to review system for soon to be billed updates.
good,"Ryder Transportation Services started as the best job I had ever worked at. They were all about the employee, when management came to visit they would go out of their way to make sure all of the technicians were happy with their job, and wanted to hear that from each and every technician, personally and face to face. After a few years their integrity decreased and the intrest of the technician was put aside as if management didn't care any more. Promises were cancelled etc."
good,"come to work everyday on time dressed in your uniform, make all your deliveries on time to each location, complete your paperwork everday and everybody is happy,"
good,good place to work. the work is steady and ever changing and can get overwhelming at times.  You do make some good contacts within Ryder that are very knowledgeable.
good,Management is lack luster at best. The Management that's good came from within. However when good Employees Attempt to Rise they are led in a Roundabout.
good,"First, I like Ryder, it's a good job, home daily, and weekends off, pay is pretty good too, especially with the guaranteed 40 hours on this contract, lots of overtime. "
good,Ample opportunity for advancement.  LDMS and 5S driven for increased efficiencies.  Monthly luncheons for team members who hit department metrics/goals.
good,4 day work weeks with OT available if wanted.  Good management with supervisors that seem to care.  Facility product is mainly on slip-sheets which can be a real pain to deal with.
good,Great company to work for. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement however you will need  to consider relocation if you would like to get into management.
good,"The work is easy,deliver to the stores and unload, management pretty laid-back at this location, as long as you do your job, only thing I don't like they will fire you quicker than they hired you."
good,"Benefits are ok, management is crazy and unbalance, there is too much problems and discomfort between the shop department and rental sales dept. Hours are ok and a lot of improve for growing."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ryder for the most part. Some Managers were great, and others, I did not like their Management style. Most of the time, it was a pleasurable rewarding experience."
good,"I love working for Ryder, my sup was excellent, my co-worker, H.R."
good,"Management is encouraging, coworkers are mostly easy to get along with. Peak seasons are around the holidays, so if you like working, it's great. Benefits are pretty average and being in a refrigerated warehouse, you are provided full thermal gear. Decent to average training."
good,"Not a bad job, easy work. For the most part management was good. They had 1 night manager that has a bad attitude. Likes to single out bikers and give them a hard time. Other than that was pretty decent place to work. If it wasn't for my disagreement with the night management I probably wouldn't have left there............. thank you"
good,"i love working at Ryder, it's not that far from where i work and i like the atmosphere even though it can sometime get a little game of thrones in there."
good,"Pretty good over all. The work life balance is really crummy depending on what team you are on. Some of the lower level managers (Team leads) are really green and do really we with getting results but not very well at actually managing those under them. I felt it was just lack of training for the managers. Everything else about it was great. They strove to provide plenty of fun office activities, parties and other team building experiences."
good,enjoyable place to work with opportunity to advance provided you show initiative. training is offered to improve your cadence. earning potential is higher than similar positions.
good,"Very happy with my time their, only left to progress my CV and earn more. Drivers worked together and this came across when you requested more work from them."
good,"Ryder is great to start at but not great to stay at. They pay below what other companies currently do (About -10k.) However, great co workers and learning are acquired"
good,It's a  good and fun place to work. You don't really grow unless you want to go to school. It has decent benefits. You can dress casual or buy uniforms that comes out of your pay check.
good,"In a typical day in my position, Overseeing a staff of Ten individuals. Throughout the day, I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,working at ryder is so so. There are days when its slow and days when its super busy. i have worked at two ryder locations and the management at both locations is poor.
good,You can go from having a slow day to extremely busy day without notice which is what i like about working at ryder; although opportunities for advancement might be limited they consider everyone who applies.
good,The company was a good company to work for.  They offered a  lot of benefits.  There was not a lot room for advancement.  All employees were cross trained.  Safety was stressed and we were trained the right way to do our jobs.
good,"Good benefits and safety is a number one priority. The company strives hard to be number one in several markets, Leasing, Rental, Warehousing, and logistics."
good,"Ryder is a normal american business that says one thing while having there middle and lower management do another then want to leave the worker holding the bag if something was to go wrong. They have all these policies and procedures in place but when you try to follow them the mangers tell you we don't have time for that. The pay is nothing special, they pay you just enough is the best way to put it. The benefits package is excellent."
good,"My typical day at work is awesome everyone got along and was just great. I have learned a lot, I never knew anything about cars now I know a lot about car parts and where They go on the car, that's a good first step! My manager was peaceful but also strict I knew my job position so I never had problems working with her, the hardest part of my job was following the work flow I was always fast at my job it worked for me. And my enjoyable part of my job was working with people."
good,"Most departments allow you to guide your own work day. As long as goals are met, and projects/requests are completed you are left to work through the day as you wish."
good,Management at my location was excellent.  The routes and customers were easy to handle and work with. Good regional work and only left due to relocation.
good,", Assign jobs to technician based  on skill and levels , order and maintain parts inventory including supplies for the building and office, create and close purchase orders."
good,"fast-paced environment, friendly management , very detailed on all departments , have to have willingness to learn your job to quickly understand the whole process."
good,"The Management is mostly personable, often understanding, and ex cellist co-worker. However, the medical benefits, though not priced erroneously, are not as good as I have experienced with much smaller companies. They believe in promoting from within, but sometimes it is still based on the good ol' boy system. Pay is not always commensurate with performance."
good,the people and environment was great. work was steady and management always willing willing to help when the workload was heavy. work well as a team and always achieved goals
good,"Relaxed enviroment with a opportunity to advance in this workforce. Hands on experience, easy going co workers and understanding bosses. Nice enviroment."
good,"Ryder is a company who expects and demands a lot from their employees but is a respected market leader with high quality products, services, and employees.  If a person is willing to work hard and welcomes a challenge Ryder is a company where a person can build a very rewarding career."
good,Typical day at Ryder handling materials and loading and unloading truck trailers. Willing to teach if you are willing to learn new things. I learned how to drive a Hilo effortlessly great Hilo instructors
good,"Focus on delivering innovation and cost-benefit across products and services.  SCS, use of OEE and Lean Culture to advance quality, cost and speed of service."
good,Very long and stressful . I have learned a lot at my company  abilities to lead and supervise drive forklift and so much else. The management is very Strong and out to better the company. Making the difficult decisions to run product.  the people are amazing very nice caring and just all about team work very dedicated.
good,Great place to work. A typical day is very busy dealing with customers and management lanes. I have learned a lot in my tenure here at Ryder. This is a great work place.
good,"The company is a great place to work, but the job you get is the job you should be comfortable with. Pay is good, but chances to advance are slim. Come with an open mind."
good,"Stressful at first, as there is a big learning curve, but once you have learned the trade it's easy, and somewhat repetitive.  Overall a great work environment with good people."
good,"Semi-high passed day. Have learned to be more involved in all aspects of the job, not only my responsibilities but those of my team mates. Hardest part of job is not meeting all the needs of request and  most enjoyable part is meeting demand of customers and management."
good,This is a great place to work paid well and got to work with some good people and it is a good learning environment as long as your not at this shop other then that they force you to work the shift that best works for management and management here is useless the only manager with a brain is retiring as far as the shop manager he will tell you everything you want to hear and only do what’s good for him the second shift manager is about to be fired for being lazy and not doing his job the parts manager can’t even keep light bulbs and wiper blades in stock and the shop runs out of oil and coolant all the time plus if you have oil you probably won’t have any filters to do the service anyway more the half of the time your out of filters and the mangment will only order parts when it’s the right time to ensure there end of the year bonus is safe if you work any other shift besides first you won’t be able to finish your works 85% of the time due to lack of parts
good,"Efficient but lacks some organization. They need more recognition for the people who do their jobs with no complaints. I thin the work force is efficient, but there needs to be a bit more communication."
good,Overall Ryder is a good place to work.  The most difficult aspect was the reflexive nature of company layoffs when stock price dipped a little.  Other than that it is a solid company to work for.
good,good overall place to work. co-workers were all good people to work with. Night hours I didnt agree with however great job to have and a good working enviroment.
good,"Not the worst place to work. Good amount of pto and benefits. Does have a lot of focus on safety, quality, and speed. Also buys needs shop tools and supplies."
good,Unfortunately I was only at this company for a period of 2 weeks to cover.  In that 2 weeks I thoroughly enjoyed the people and the working environment and would recommend as a potential employer.
good,El horario que tenia era muy accesible par auqe pudiera terminar mi universidad
good,"I would recommend this as a good place to work ,because time flies. the pay is rewarded with the effort you invest, they provide bonus's for those who do more then the required amount aswell."
good,"Aprendí a estandarizar cualquier proceso."
good,Ryder provides a great work environment. They have great benifits for all employees. The schedules ad working hours could be better for parents. Ryder provides plenty of training for your job description and training for advancement
good,Professional...Nice working environment.  Very knowledgeable and helpful co-workers.  I enjoyed working there very much and would have became an employee if the opportunity would have been there at the time.
good,"the shift was awesome- 6am-2:30pm. management was great never had an issue with them. and work was steady. I bounced within departments to help out, etc"
good,Can't speak for others but the account that I work is great! Hauling steel  (flatbed). Great coworkers and Manager is awesome. Place could use more structure at times but you learn on the fly. With Ryder you can transfer anywhere after a year if there's an opening. But drivers is always needed everywhere. Decent pay and you don't to killed yourself.
good,Driving to store appointments in a timely manner. Unloading deliveries and uploading returns. I have learned patience as a driver. Not everyone is considerate of others time and schedule. Dealing with traffic is the hardest part of the job. Dealing with a wide range of personalities.
good,"this company is actually one of the few i would still recommend to this day. very well organized, productive team members and everyone works together on each shift. people became my friends here."
good,"fun place to work, friendly enviornment,excellent human resource deparment, great senior level management, climate controled facility, easy to operate forklifts"
good,Spent all my time there working in the automotive industry very active and demanding.  Lot's of opportunity to learning how the industry works and the global aspect of the business.
good,Great  benefit package great people some of upper management can be a little hard to work with but the supervisors are great Co workers are great and the pay is very good! You barly have a home life tho because of all the schedule changes but if you don't mind the cold and the schedule constantly changing then Ryder is a good pick!
good,Good company with good training.  Great if you like working with all different types of equipment From pick up trucks to sleeper units. Management is not that great though
good,"Ryder is a decent company to work for. they will more than willingly train you, and work you to your potential. if you feel uncomfortable doing a job, they do not force you to do it. work on good trucks, plenty of job security if you come to work, do your job, keep your nose clean and try your hardest. "
good,"Rental is a fun side of the company. Lot of interaction with people, getting to be on your feet and not chained to a desk all day. Email is pretty overkill throughout the company, but you adapt."
good,"Everyday work life there was pretty good. They pay pretty well. Vacation and attendance was good too. Hardest part of the job is probaby the over time, but thats as a forklift driver. Material handlers may say otherwise."
good,Overall I was satisfied with my employment. Management was understanding and I had many more good experiences than bad. Obviously no company is perfect but Ryder offers many opportunities for learning and advancement.
good,It seems in most cases that the only way to advance is to relocate. The paperwork is redundant and often times unnecessary as most information is tracked on numerous software programs. The overall feedback heard from other employees is that there is a serious lack of respect and communication.
good,"Good company to work for, company benefits  are great, my co-workers were good to work with, great up to date equipment to drive and well maintained"
good,I worked under contract with AT&T. The AT&T management and staff treated us like animals. Management was worst of all time. would not work for this company ever again.
good,"Ryder has a culture of everyone working for HR first the for the customer. Very rigid oversight, which management does not react well to. Management is very fair and knowledgeable. They treat their employees well. Lots of hours for the salaried management staff with no additional compensation."
good,"come in early review what's on schedule find out what drive ins are emergency,review incompleted jobs needing finished talk to management on any other issues.training was exceptional besides day to day a class was scheduled at least twice a year.most enjoyable part of my job was l love working on anything"
good,I worked with great hard working people who were amazing at their job and would bend over backwards to work as a team. Ryder was fantastic at being flexible if you had any family issues that you had to take off for a brief period of time and just overall very supportive of your work/family balance.
good,"Get to work, start to set up my carts for the first run to the assembly line. Then throughout the day just keep delivering parts to the line without shutting it down"
good,Ryder is a good company to work for with many opportunities for growth. you also have the ability to move to new locations if necessary. Management at the local levels are usually great to work with.
good,They did have some problems with the way they were doing business with Emery water house. management was trying to caver more areas than could have been done.
good,"Great pay, great health insurance,co-workers nice, service managers is great, all the over time you want,, you can move up in the company"
good,"keeping lines up and running to meet orders,enjoyed working with maintenance dept management in our department was great,there was no hard part of my job,i took great pride in machining parts and making repairs to equipment to save the company money and getting orders out on time"
good,Leave Sunday and home by Saturday for your 34 hour break. No raises in 9 yrs even though I am on the top driver list most of the year.
good,"- a typical work day includes: brake jobs, PMs,  and engine repairs"
good,"Work Balance was always considered and benefits were fair. I did work with a lot of talented co-workers, and enjoyed making progress with process and procedures with them."
good,"En general es un buen lugar para trabajar, ya que el personal esta capacitado para desempeñar cada una de sus actividades"
good,"As a Six Sigma certified champion I enjoy leading change through improving quality and streamlining operations while increasing customer satisfaction at Ryder service centers throughout Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  As of January 2016 due to job elimination at Ryder, I am in search of opportunities for employment."
good,Nice working environment just needs better salary and raises and need to go in depth about the top out pay and amount of raises
good,"two week sprints"
good,"Good management,"
good,"Fast paced environment. Open 24/7, allowed to work overtime and holidays. Required to learn multiple systems which was a benefit."
good,Ryder was a fast pace warehouse where I was able to gain experience that can be used for years to come. Overall my four years with the company was enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at Ryder, includes managing the night operations for Shell, Devon, and Chevron as our major oil and gas accounts. Each day presents a new experience or challenge, everyday is the night the same. Commenting on co-workers will be difficult due to working night operations, I do not interact with my co-workers and I am always working alone. I may see some of my peers that works days once a year. The hardest part of my job is trying to resolve serious issues at 3:00 am, but the most enjoyable is the ability to be granted the authority to make senior management decisions."
good,I manage a team of 12 direct reports to maximize the companies assets through leadership and teambuilding skills while providing excellent customer service.  The most challenging part of my career is developing direct reports and it's the most enjoyable part as well because it gives me the opportunity to set goals and drive results.
good,"One of the best jobs to this day, granted my forklift certification which opened up more doors for me. Good management as well as great hours."
good,"I was able to learn how to operate a hot pressed machine hot glue gun and stocked and organized materials. I would be doing the books manual or on the back stocking up the lines. Followed directions to stretch before starting shift, wear gloves and a plastic cap over your head. The management would yell too much and the coworkers would be friendly most of them. The hardest thing was if someone would messed up the order everybody would get in trouble for it. The most enjoyable that time went by fast and they would switch all of us around to be able to learn the different areas of the warehouse duties."
good,"Day starts with shift meeting with sups,They tell you your job function for the day,and you go and pre check your equipment for the day. Then you go to the shipping office and get your work order for the truck you are to load,finish and repeat.."
good,great bunch of guys to work with we all got along great and this made it a fun place to work
good,"Busy everyday, everybody is busy doing their own task and I larned so many things on this company about the trade which added to my knowledge and it includes safe working environment for yourself and for your coworkers. Trade is my passion that's why I enjoyed my job as start and hoping to advance someday,the hardest part of this job is to do that you know how but you can't because you were bound to the rules and for having a new coworker that doesn't listen on your opinions and advices."
good,Checking on both inbound and outbound shipments. This was a temp position and the company closed it's doors.
good,"Always easy to coordinate with family, Managers are very respectful. Job/Responsibilities were not very challenging and pay was lower than average."
good,"This job I work in for 1 years, this job gave me the ability to be more aware of what it take to be aware of the dangers on the job"
good,At work my co workers and I work in an environment that makes it enjoyable  to come to everyday.
good,"Developing maps"
good,upper management very easy to work for.  quality equipment and drivers.  closed due to auto slowdown
good,"Very busy  a non stop day. "
good,Ryder provides their employees the tools necessary to learn and to grow.
good,Ryder offers good training opportunities for employees at entry level.  The company demonstrates good business ethics and works to develop its current employees.  Opportunities for advancement can be challenging to find.
good,"- great team atmosphere"
good,"deliver to ford in Phx"
good,"I get to work fully dressed and ready, I'm giving updated status on what has happened for the day crew and what needs to be done then I assign my co-worker to a task and start my own.I've learned different aspects but in this field you learn something new everyday!"
good,My typical day at work is me driving a tractor trailer for 11 hours a day. It gets lonley out on the road and I'm ready for a change.
good,Allocating trucks to commercial and consumer rentals and ensuring customer needs are fully diagnosed and addressed.
good,Nice corporate culture. Great benefits. Good opportunities for career advancement.
good,"A typical day begins with analyzing the performance from the previous day, in comparison to the same day for the past 4 week. Followed by meeting with the area managers in order to help them develop and/or finalize the work plan for the day/week. Meeting with the management team daily in order to discuss any issues and/or concerns from the hourly associates, as well as ensuring that the team is fair and consistent in administering any policies and procedures."
good,"This was my first career gig outside of the food service industry, and it was definitely different than I was expecting. The account managers go out of their way to make sure their customer are taken care of in any situation. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the fact that lease customers came first, even though the company made more money off of regular rental customers. The thing I really enjoyed was the fact that everyone in the office has gone through the position before, so they were able to answer question that may come up."
good,"Had a good time overall working for the company. When I was removed from one account looked to find something else within the company. But due to their requirements, and feeling that if you do not have a college Degree you are not qualified for a lot of jobs, no matter what your experience levels are, they could not do anything further"
good,"I have worked for Ryder for 7 years and the job is never ending. The pay is descent and the freedom allowed to managers ranks among the highest I have experienced. The daily work environment is fast-paced, high stress and requires great focus and stamina."
good,Seniority drivers at my location were not noticed for job advancement by managment.
good,"ambiente relajado, hay que estar al pendiente de las necedidades del cliente"
good,Great company and environment to work for.  I made an unfortunate paperwork mistake and was terminated.  I was very sad abo9ut this as I really enjoyed my position and friends there.
good,Independent work place with no one looking over your shoulder. Flexible work hours.  A few conference calls in a week with supervisor.  Working and dealing with AT&T Employees.
good,"This job was a steady income fulltime experience in a team enviornment.  The management were very helpfull in the day to day operations on the job,as well ashelping their drivers."
good,"At Ryder you sit at your desk all day looking at a computer. You sit with your team so there is an opportunity to chat and have fun while you do it. They have night positions as well as a position with 3-4, 12 hour days. Salary is low for the industry but very easy job"
good,Slow paced but with GM as the customer we are working whatever hours they dictate. And they have been working 6 days a week for years.  If you like OT you’ll love it here.
good,The huge scope of the corporation allows for a lot of miss use of power between the top executives down to the lowest management and communication at least down to the lower levels was poor
good,"Ryder has a solid corporate culture that truly focuses on the employee maintaining a work life balance.  Job responsibilities will be dependent upon the customer account, some are more tedious than others."
good,"ALL Ryder driving jobs are dedicated to one particular customer."
good,"El trabajo está muy bien , únicamente que los encargados no son parejos para exigir trabajo; mientras unos trabajamos otros se la pasan platicando  u oyendo musica con los audifonos. En lo personal creo que hay discriminación para las personas ,Ojalá puedan tener más control con las personas que son supervisores para que ellas sean conscientes porque todos ganamos lo mismo.gracias"
good,"A fast paced fun work environment. Offers different work schedules, days and hours. Gives you the option to get overtime. Great job opportunities are available."
good,"The work environment very pleasant. The coworkers very respectful."
good,"Not bad company to work for but also not the best. Workers really made it well known you were a ""new guy"" training was okay but lack of understanding was very high."
good,From the years I have worked with Ryder I have come to find that if you put in the hours and learn the jobs you will succeed. Personally I think Ryder is a great company to work for!
good,"Pay is good fast paced safe environment good management.  Hours are hard to adjust to,  4am till 2pm Monday through Friday and mandatory Saturdays.  And no pay raises for becoming a full time employee"
good,New hires make about the same as someone who's been there for years.  Jobs not bad good job security.  Not terrible hours.  Management is for the company not the driver.
good,"very easy job if you know how to operate a forklift. youre on your forklift 95% of the time anyway. you want more you have to work, 60hrs is the set OT."
good,Reorganizing all the warehouse positions and putting more resources to train them to work towards the face of the company. Would be good to have a great leader that makes a great team.
good,"I would still work there, but I had some medical issues...not a problem now.. I hope to try again soon.. I hope to be reconsidered for a job . I would love to see what happens with the company."
good,delivers steel to companies in midwest. Safety culture is excellent monthly training and safety bonuses. Loved this job did it at my own pace . Customer service was number 1.
good,It required very precise execution of relatively complicated delivery on a daily basis and I enjoyed the challenge but found it exhausting and ultimately impossible to meet there ridiculously high criteria.
good,"Great job looking for something different ,away from home to long, looking hot something different this should be good for you and i am done with what I have to ssy"
good,"Good Place to work if you don't mind the long hours."
good,"The best part about working for Ryder was that I got to meet numerous people from different States.  Everyone that I met were polite, patient, and very easy going.  To this day I still keep in contact with a select few of those from the company."
good,I liked working here and enjoyed having the opportunity to learn and get certified using a reach and forklift truck. Also the people at Whirlpool warehouse were very helpful and friendly.
good,"Great company to work for.lots of great people,customers. Can be very fast paced environment.always lots of work .safety is always number 1 , with a good safety record you can and will be rewarded."
good,Large and established company.  Great opportunity of advancement and paid training both on the job and in the classroom. Also opportunities to cross over to a branch company or location.
good,"I moved to Ryder because I wanted something different.  There are ways to make more money at Ryder.  Safety is huge at Ryder.  If you work hard, you can make more money."
good,Great account manager would work with or for him anytime he allowed me to do my job and did not micro manage. i was allowed to work directly with the costumer to adjust to suit their ever changing needs.
good,"It was very exciting to work for Ryder, the employers and Boss was very happy people to work with. They felt like family to me, I just dont have nothing bad to say at all, I just enjoyed my time there and I thank them for giving me the chance to be apart of there company."
good,"Extremely high turn over rate makes for great job security. A typical day consists of dealing with other shifts mistakes due to the constant influx of untrained people who eventually quit or never learn to perform their functions. 10-11 hour days minimum. Management watches each break and speaks to individuals who extend their breaks. If you do your job at least at the minimum and don't extend breaks, management generally leaves you alone. Still, a fine place to work."
good,There is no time to be messing around here. You're either working or goofing off. Orders need to be shipped out and inventory has to be counted right.
good,"I work a typical 8 hour day Mon-Fri.  An occasional overtime day may be needed, but are fairly rare.  Hardest part of the job sometimes is finding something to do when the work slows down.  It is a relaxed atmosphere.  Great people to work around."
good,Need to be quick on your feet as it relates to decision making. Focus on safety protocol and following standardized processes. A very competitive segment
good,"If you fit in with the management team, they will train you on other job titles and promote you. I was lucky in that regard and moved steadily up the ladder with them."
good,Ryder is a good company with decent management. Equipment is up to date. I would recommend Ryder to someone seeking employment. Hours can be long .....
good,There is roughly 40 forklifts at this plant which does all of the PepsiCo products and there is a million sq . feet in this warehouse which is capable of  handling up to 120 semi's in a day there I am certified in 3 types of forklifts there up to 2019
good,Ryder is good to its employees and offers plenty of opportunity for growth for those willing to work for it. The team structure is solid and is designed to support the employees.
good,I enjoyed working there everyone had a positive attitude and the work was the same as i have done in the past at other companies.  My boss was professional and well liked.
good,Is a great place to work. They have several locations in different cities for career advancement. The company values are followed by management and is shared with the employees.
good,"Ryder offers many opportunities to learn and train into new Positions. My Current Location offers many lessons. To further your skills and Knowledge to advance you through the company. The pay, for my location, is very undercut for the work you do."
good,Ryder has provided me the opportunity to strengthen my sales skills and learn how to deal with diversity and challenges in the work place. I have benefited greatly from the work environment and hope to take these traits to my next business endeavor.
good,daily workout stretches to help for your shift group discussions about any concerns great management personal checks on employees fair company haven't worked there in forever though
good,"i regret leaving but it was time to move on, no chance of getting on first shift and was underpaid for services rendered. good shop, great people, low pay but great benefits"
good,I lost 30 pounds in my first 3 months. i was a case picker and you are throwing 15-60 pound boxes all day. it was definitely quite the work out. The best part is the rate the harder you worked the more you got paid.
good,Ryder is a great place to work. A leader in the transportation industry. Provides you with a good working environment. Very structured work place with good people.
good,Overall it was a decent place to work. They had good management and it was a fun place to work. They took good care of all employees and had plenty of room for advancement and helped in whatever way they could.
good,"amazing company to work for but managers, supervisors and HR representatives makes the company and work life irritating. overall, if they stop hiring university graduates to work in the industry. working at the shop will make life a lot better"
good,"I had not intended to move or leave, but the employee I had replaced returned to work. I would have loved to stay on. I worked nights and was busy. I really never saw my manager unless something went wrong. I would not work nights again, but I did get overtime."
good,Ryder was great in my opinion. As a driver you can transfer to different accounts and continue your benefits. Only thing protreads gets pretty annoying after a while. Be extremely careful driving and dont get a RAB. More then 2 in a 2 two years will lead to termination
good,A lot of experience on hand! Great Technicians that become friends and mentors. The pay is good and depending on the location good management as well.
good,"casual attire for mailing "
good,I've been at Ryder going on 7 yrs.  It's a great company to work for. I would recommend Ryder to anyone thats looking for employment. A regular day is fast- paced which makes the time go by fast. Allows OT.
good,"nothing bad to say, it's actually organized and good management/support staff and a team environment, good drivers on this account, mostly teams with automatic transmission trucks, decent truck/trailer."
good,It is a great place to work busy and fast paced everyone is helpful and we all interact well with each other.I learned to operate different machinery in the building. The hardest part of the job was the lifting other than that it was great
good,"Managers are easy to work with, the work is fast paced. The hardest part can be the amount of tasks that a person has to manage on a daily basis is quite large."
good,schedules are good especially for part time. You are paid weekly and they have direct deposit. The safety program is excellent. They pay you to do safety video viewings.
good,The company was very focused on making sure the employees knew their job and were equipped to move up in the company.  They spent the time with each person to train them continually.  The only bad part was they did not pay very well.
good,"Typical work day included servicing a wide variety of equipment for our lease customers."
good,"My experience at Ryder Warehousing was not the best, but was alright. The people there were all good, and overall it was a good starting pay and good experience. They were willing to train and certify people to operate forklifts who had no prior experience, which I thought was great."
good,"Been there for 11 years. Met some good co-working people whom were very friendly and easy to work with. We have sadly lost some to illness. Our Manager is a very fair person. He is so, because he rose through the ranks and, knows what people expect of him. Very fair person."
good,"Overall good company, made good bonus on job performance areas. Lots of travel. Many of the people I supervised were well into working many years for the company and they were the ones who helped me the most to fulfill my job requirements"
good,"In an average day at Ryder you could go from just changing oil and filters to doing a complete engine haul, in a matter of hrs. Or get taken off of one unit to work on some elses and not know where everything goes because they were unorganized."
good,"Interesting place. Lots of favoritism. If you are good at your job they will keep you in the same position for as long as they can. If you suck, you get promoted."
good,Im very pleased from the experience at this place. I have learned quite abit if different variety of things. I am very active employee so i enjoy having the opportunity to do all of these things.
good,"Ryder was an ok company to work for lots of overtime but no raises due to a ""wage freeze"" while i was there. management was bad they lost the account."
good,"Good people all the way from management to techs"
good,This was a logistics environment that require continue follow up with my warehouse employees and my route drivers. I always enjoy the daily challenges and the resolutions.
good,Great company to work for. Great opportunities for growth. Very challenging and fast pace environment under the Logistics Vertical area. Employee's safety is their number one priority.
good,it was a great job with great people but can get laid off at anytime when ever GM closes a plant of end a shift.no job security. the pay could be better but its ok.
good,I was given raises and promotions. How could I complain? Yes there are a few hang ups but no job is perfect. Ryder is a good company that takes care of its customers and employees.
good,Ryder is a good account. The leadership team is very strong and will help with whatever if needed.  I have advanced a lot of skills due to the leadership at this account.
good,Most of the time its never the same day twice. Changing and exciting. Busy with fun people to work with. Challenging duties so its rarely boring. Lots of opportunities for overtime.
good,Ryder is a good company to work for just the lack of overtime and working second shift with a growing family is hard but overall Ryder is a great place to work if your looking to grow as a technician
good,"Good company to work. Environment is good , job is straight forward. I would for sure recommend this job to someone else. Good benefits nice raises .."
good,"Wake up, take a shower, let the dogs outside, take medication, drive to warehouse, get paperwork, load truck, do DVIR, drive to first delivery location, complete all deliveries, return to warehouse to pull product for next day's deliveries. drive home"
good,"A typical day with Ryder is usually very busy with phones, customer's needing assistance and keeping the shop running smoothly.  "
good,Is only possible in certain deparments and you will be promised the moon to stay in a certain position. You need to get out if you do not seeing multiple people being promoted at a high pace
good,"Fast paced but easy to keep up, good work flow and everything you need to do the job. Safety is a must within the company because we are driving forklifts."
good,They offer great opportunities for people who like to work hard and does not mind working with customer. They offer the training you need to better yourself.You may have to work weekend and nights.
good,"It is a good company to work for, However had my hours change  2 times. Then they change my off days and I did not like that. Benefits are good and pay is decent."
good,"I have loved working here and the ONLY reason that I am leaving is because they were unable to give a more appropriate salary for the job that you do in this position. Working with truckers is definitely a unique experience but absolutely one that I would do again! My manager is definitely in my top 3 of all managers I've had and I'm 30. I've had quite a few. Just a really relaxed and down to earth environment with little to no micro-management. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see the over-the-road drivers' puppies when they have them. The hardest part of the job would probably be keeping up your organizational system with frequent changes. Also the gate..I could do without the gate. Overall, I wish we could have made the salary work because this place will be missed!"
good,"An overall great place to work. I would have to make sure the customer needs was meet at all times, while managing 4 accounts. I would also have to make sure that the materials was delivered on time every time."
good,In the past 10 years that I have been employed here I have learned a great deal about the logistics field. Have a lot of good teachers in management that have pushed me to where I am now.
good,It was a challange to work there with the people you would come in contact with. I liked the everyday experence I had working there. The staff and mangement was great.
good,"This is a graet place to work if your an independent self motivated person."
good,"Critical thinking "
good,The employees at this company was very nice to work with. Management sometimes a little stiff but not that bad. My salary could have been better because I was doing a lot inside and out for the company. I don't have many complaints where I was located.
good,Started the day off running full force.  It was fast paced and independent which I excelled in.  It was a new environment for me as I had never worked in the transportation industry so it was challenging to say the least but the technicians were very patience and helpful and I became successful in no time.  The hardest part was the lack of structure that my location had but we made the best of it.
good,"Awesome work place and people.  Very good safety program that when followed made a difference.  Lots of work and projects while working there.  Learned lots.  Best part of the work was that there was a variety of challenges daily with Projects, special demands from the customer and just plain day to day stuff with people.  "
good,Quiet Working environment Sometimes Gets boring (most of the time). Management Is not the best. Techs are good people to socialize with.
good,Work starts at 7 clean up warehouse after inventory has been put away safety conference call everyday the day is usually over 3:30 Monday throw Friday
good,This was a great place to work. The facility and equipment were top shelf. Company restructured and lost the importance of it's employees.
good,"I enjoyed the flexible schedules for days, nights and weekends. It has a great group of people to work for and with. It always keeps you busy to stay on top of things for the day."
good,"This company outside of the Atlanta branch, was OK. This company ""prides"" itself on ""safety"" as long as you don't let the higher ups know that your manager is involving the company in illegal activity. Then, you don't have a job..... Good luck with HR too. However, the training staff is top notch, and most of the fellow employees are really fun to work with. More like a family than anything. The most enjoyable part was my fellow shop employees, and the worst was the management. I did learn a lot and enjoyed meeting different people and drivers."
good,"Assist in trouble shooting with techs. Perform triage on drive ups."
good,"Location is close to home. There isn't enough work daily. Theres a lot of lay offs, and the job security and wearing very thin."
good,One of the responsibilities of the Shop Supervisor was to ensure repairs to vehicles are completed timely as well as dispatching mobile technicians to perform roadside services to downed vehicles.
good,"I've enjoyed working for Ryder, good management and diversity. The hours have been just for the materials aided.  Overall happy."
good,"Working with new clients understanding business processes.  Writing code interface to clients application, working with Ryder logistics engineers to meet business rules for load planning and delivery schedules.  Conference calls to discuss prospective new client opportunities and quoting interface efforts.  Assigning tasks to team employees and reviewing work results as required.  Documenting interface process for end users.  Training client and Ryder end users on interfaces and modifying code as required to streamline process.  Available for support of application and hardware, connectivity issues as needed.  Interface with various Ryder and client IT teams to resolve issues outside of my control.  Work with third party software companies to test interfacing as new versions are released.  Modify our code as required to work seamless with all versions of third party vendor.  Work as level three support supporting Ryder level one and two with daily issues.  Document resolution and train support in future resolve of similar issue.  Support areas were payroll processing, billing processing, printing issues, ftp processes and application interfaces.  Management was supportive but typically there were four or more hours of conference calls per day which really hampered ability to support accounts as needed.  Co-workers were great with always a team effort to complete tasks.  Hardest part of the job was juggling various support tasks and making all required conference calls without working after hours and weekends.  Most enjoyable part was supporting the end user and producing a productive"
good,Deliver and move trucks to locations for customers.Supervisors where professional and easy to work  with. There was a very  good teamwork among the drivers and staff.
good,"We would set up our fleet of delivery trucks for the day based the amount of routes given. Our routes would be assigned and when the big rig truck arrived, all the drivers would unload the racks from the truck and place them in specified area. After racks are loaded into delivery trucks and parcel counted for, the driver assigned takes truck to route. "
good,Ryder was a great place to work until I couldn't be garented a transfer once my captive shop closed down.
good,Over all its a good place to work. I think they need to be more tuff on s.o.p  for drivers.
good,"great place to work but as soon as you show what your capable of they cut your chances of growing , no management oportunities"
good,"Newer vehicles to work on.   However, too much paperwork to get job done."
good,Buena empresa; Abierta a los cambios; con una buena filosofía y con los objetivos muy bien establecidos
good,"ryder is a big company, I liked going to all the different places, and a lot of different product."
good,"Workday started last 5 years around 5:30 AM to 6:00 AM. Had some great co workers. Constantly changing management, and changing immediate supervisors. Hardest part of the job was the constant change in management and the requirements set by Xerox.  Best part of the job was 4 weeks vacation after 15 years of service."
good,great training in all different types of diesel mechanic. tolls necessary for jobs are always available
good,"I usually go on a normal day at work and check a pm sheet and go to do offsite maintenance, if there is no pms to be done offsite I usually go to the UTC in converse, and check with customers for repairs if needed and go to do a yard check and do a 3 month inspection to each unit and check over for repairs and fix when I do the inspections. I love talking with the guys at work they are very polite and know what has to be done, the hardest part of the job is making sure to keep the customer informed including getting with the DOO, DOM, and my service manager about the repair status unless it is a repair we cannot do and goes to a vendor for the repairs"

good,There is a lot of work to get done in a day my co-workers are good guys to work with and they help when you need it. its a fun job but you have to like what you are doing at the end of the day. there is some fun but most of all I am there to work and go home. management is Ok they have there up and down days so when its good its good.
good,"* Hard work, but capable of meeting deadlines and prioritizing work "
good,"Performed shipping and logistics administration as a Warehouse Assistant. Used specialized tracking tools and software including RF Scanners, specialized labels and inventory databases."
good,Co-workers were awesome.
good,Start up meeting at 6:00am followed by stretching then some followups at the machines about the day before. Then we all get on the rados and start running calling out any problems that are keeping the line from running. Are management team is great they help us every minute they can. All the people that work will help you also when you ask. Everyone has a real great attitude most of the time. We all try are best. The hardest part of the day is when things do not run smooth but they get worked out. The most enjoyable part is when we meet production goals and go over are goals and feel we did a great job.
good,"Ryder works off of different accounts..so it depends on the account that your on..the accounts i have worked have been delivery,beverage,newspaper,kitchen products ext. A typical day would consist of driving a class b truck,making deliveries from an invoice,deliver products to customers..in a safe and timely manner.."
good,I was not getting enough rest on this job.I was getting home like three in the morning.I would not get to bed till about five . there no cushion for anything on this job.
good,"a typical day is filled with a variable of tasks, it definitely makes your work day go fast."
good,pay and job security did not apply to me.
good,"Ryder has been good to me so I cannot complain about the company. As with all companies, there is room for improvement; but Ryder provides opportunities for advancement and growth, especially for entry-level prospects."
good,"Es una empresa muy buena, con politicas, codigos de conducta y de seguridad que se respetan."
good,"Enjoy working with dipatchers and drivers, they are fun and kept my day going. The warehouse management completely trust my work :)"
good,"Culture of innovation, demand the best. Always trying to be Lean, but can be difficult to remember what your core job is outside what you are being asked to do on the project side. Still a good, solid place to work that is well prepared for economic downturns."
good,"Fortune 500 company, great place to work. Amazing benefits."
good,"Ryder is a very friendly place to work. Employees are all very friendly and will befriend you rapidly. Management leaves a little to be desired as far as movement upward in the company, but that is a matter of opinion."
good,The management is enthusiastic about getting you on the floor and getting to work immediately. Cross-training at several positions is a must. If you want a fast moving job where you need to think quickly - it will be at Ryder.
good,"Best company I have ever worked for. Take that with a grain of salt because I'd only ever worked for owner operators before. The equipment is new and well-maintained so the Peace of Mind from that helps a lot. There's a lot of work to do, I average 55 to 60 hours a week. On busy weeks it is closer to 70. The pay is okay. We get extra money for working Saturday. I've never had any problems with management. But I don't call in and I don't complain so that probably helps"
good,Been a few years now but they gave me a chance even with Me being a single a mom and doing a job that was considered at the time to be a man's job.  I worked in different areas as well.
good,Allow drivers to  Manage there  on routes with dispatcher. Job security 401- K over time  Available. UAW Available.  Life and health insurance  is available.
good,"Extremely busy, physically challenging, sweaty ,dirty job. Nevertheless there’s a reward at the end of the day. Loved working with a crew we pull together to get the job done and on schedule."
good,Great job with GREAT BENEFITS  and Great ppl to work with... Upfront ppl with plenty of work to do... Love the job and ppl but not a chance to move up in a higher position....
good,Many opportunities  for advance  if.your willing to work hard. Good salary  with overtime if desired.  Most management is good. Employees  are friendly.
good,"The contract I was apart of worked in individual branch locations of the clients. Other than in the morning, I worked in relative seclusion managing the logistics and inventory of the locations."
good,Numerous account in a huge space but not much dividing you from the person working another account. My account doesn't regularly make phone calls but the account next to me did and all I could hear was the information being passed over the phone.
good,"Ryder is fast paced and hardwork at first, but after you learn your job, it's just fast paced. Some management is better than others, but they just want to have high quality and no mistakes. The culture is mostly good. The only time it's bad is when there is manditoried overtime. The hardest part of the job is having to rely on other people. When you know you can do your job but have to trust others to do theirs is sometimes a headache, but we get through it. The best part is always the workers. We share a common goal and work with each other a lot. I've learned there's always more to do and more to learn. I've held 5 job postions here and I still learn more all the time."
good,Ryder was a great place to work for. I loved the people and the work. My only issue was the hours. We were on 12 hour shifts. We were forced to work on our days off. At one time I went 19 days without a day off.
good,Good place to start up your career. Good management. They have lots of opportunities to change career into any other ryder department.  Very easy to grow up the rank. Down side with this company the that career growth path is not defined. Definitely lot of HR deficiency. Most of the promotion is done at the manager's/ supervisor's discretion. They make lots of bad choices some time. This problem might just be unique to the account i worked for in Edmonton. Might not be a Company wide problem.
good,The time I spent at Ryder was filled with many months of overtime which was profitable but sometimes exhausting and hard on work/life balance.  I was glad to develop my SAP system skills to aid Ryder's single client:  John Deere
good,You will work one of three shifts. Most second or third. There are times you be asked to switch to cover a switch. Then end up back on your shift. Patience is a virtue there.
good,"Work hard learn quick be consistent  . It's a good job . Wish I still had it . If your looking for a career, it's a great  place to start . Would be good for young people straight out of school"
good,"overall a good company to work for, very competitive work environment and at times does seem the individual contributor is overlooked. No difference than other companies, especially if accounts are being downsized for economic reasons, appears there's not much assistance in job placement within Ryder or outside, the employee being cut feels they are absorbing 100% of the burden of finding a new job,  not only is there stress about losing the current position but there's no assistance in helping to find a new position, added stress and negative reflection of the company"
good,I know alot of people can work but putting too much pressure can bring them down. Trying to load and unload a trailer by yourself is stressful. Team work makes the job more fun and fast.
good,I loved my job and team members but there was some unfair treatment from higher up the chain. Overall it was a great experience and I would work there again.
good,"It all depends on the account, you are hired for will determine if you will stay working for them the company it’s self is a great company to work for but the account they hire you for will determine it all"
good,Ryder was a blast to work at.  Plenty of opportunities for growth. Very busy and growing business.  Steady work and always had opportunities for overtime.
good,Always willing to train anyone in any available position.  The training for the new position was will thought out and effective.  Management was very approachable.  Employees felt appreciated.
good,"it was a contract job through staffinders but from what I saw the people were nice to work with the management was friendly  and I learned some things I never had done before in relation to receiving of freight. When I ran a forklift for APL, logistics it was mostly physical unloading and stacking using on the ground help and clamp trucks. At Ryder there was much computer work involved.  It was not as rushed as Full Beauty where I was primarily a packer which was very hectic indeed.  However, I made the effort to do things as quickly as possible as I feel I owe that to  any employer I work for."
good,Lots of training on all types of vehicles. They make sure you get all you need to do your job. Fast paced makes the day go by fast but can get stressful at times
good,Culture is good they promote inclusion and associate satisfaction. The organization is very safety conscious has many programs to promote safety and give the proper tools to work safe. Technology used within the organization is cutting edge!
good,If your a hard worker you still get treated like the lazy workers. But still a great pace to be for the benefits. If your a technician be ready to buy your own tools even if the Shop is suppose to supply them. Most of the Shop tools are broken or not take care of.
good,"It is a good company overall. I am sad that I have to relocate and it doesn't look like they will allow me to work from my new location. However, it may be time to leave as there are no advancement opportunities from within the company."
good,"great job to work at great people there, all they ask of you is to do your job. Management doesn't get any better they are laid back and they don't mind helping when you need it."
good,While at Ryder I was promoted twice over a 10yr period.  I was able to use all of my skills and attend many training opportunities.  Ryder is committed to its employees and Customers.
good,Ryder is good company with opportunity to grow and has a good workplace culture. The company was very good about acknowledging team members when they performed. Since being a 3PL and the site I was at was a food distribution center so had to work most holidays however the company was very good about making the employees were appreciated by paying holiday pay and either having a cook out or catering food in. Overall very good company to work for.
good,It was a interesting place to work and if i could go back i would. Long days but amazing people.There was some management issues sometimes but they would get through it well.
good,Empresa internacional con grandes clientes y muchas cosas para aprender en las diferentes areas.
good,The day to day for this job is pretty cool. The routine is kinda the same everyday but you get to meet plenty of cool people.The set work hours make it pretty easy to either have a part time job or attend school.
good,"I enjoyed that the company is understanding about family needs. Allowing time off when you have a family emergency. Also, when an employee is having domestic problems."
good,"Loved working for ryder and they are a great company, but I've come to a stall and need to move on to progress. They provide good guidelines and the more experienced techs will help but only if you ask questions. The computer system is not good and very slow but it is what it is. There always seems to be some drama that goes on between morning shift and swing shift, but overall I can't complain other than I need to progress faster and move on."
good,"very friendly organization, can be political, and is definitely a fortune 500 company. Reward hard work. Very understanding with family/ work. Hands off sales approach."
good,"Productive fast paced. Big productions with pringles. Good Hours during the day 1st shift. Great Company to be at.Great Managemen. 30 minute lunch breaks, and three 10 minute breaks are good."
good,"Nice place to work with decent benefits, but like a lot of places now where you start is where you stay. New people will start out making more than you and the only way to get a raise is to quit."
good,"You will spend a lot of time away from you're family. But you will get paid good money working for Ryder. The company will teach you what they want you to know. Techs will learn how to do Pm service, exhaust maintenence, air brakes service, as you progress in time you can earn up to 5 week's of vacation."
good,If you like dealing with people in a fast paced environment then this is a good job.. There is never a dull day and you are supported thru out the function.
good,"Start at 06:30. Weed thru 150 emails, delete 400 unread. Scan parts for coverage thru the current day. It's now 07:15. Start calling parts to the plant floor for counts and react to the inevitable losses while fielding calls from suppliers, carriers, the receiving docks and Ryder's centralized management center at a rate of one call every 10 minutes. Do that until 11:00, then do that while eating lunch at my desk for a half hour, then do that until 15:00. Also there will be between 3 and 20 alerts spread through the day from the offsite warehouse telling me that the plant is calling for parts that they do not have."
good,everyone that work in this place was nice you would get a good morning from everyone and a by at the end of day. Always had overtime. not a stressful place
good,"Clock in, lead man gives you keys to a truck and you go to work. Co workers were always willing help out. Management is pretty decent. Upper upper management is a little hard to deal. Sales guys treat you pretty bad."
good,My position was a local positions so I can't speak on the OTR part of the company but they will fire you for any little thing in the handbook even if its a simply mistake.
good,"Accounting Experience, Logistics Experience, Scheduling Experience , all gained from this position.  Workplace was very family orientated, the hardest part of the job was learning the rules and regulations of each vendor. Most enjoyable part of the job was the technician and their help."
good,"Driving truck is a tough job, but Ryder is family friendly "
good,"Starting as a maintenance tech, the Ryder team looked at my capabilities and gave me continuous opportunity to excel with my current knowledge as well as gained knowledge from onsite experience."
good,"Management and coworkers were great to work with, truely a team effort. Plenty of overtime during Peak season.  I enjoyed working there and learned a lot."
good,"The MRP Planner has the primary responsibility for fulfilling indirect material requirements to support maintenance, facilities, and ME requirements, and managing indirect material inventory levels to agreed targets. Key activities include approval and creations of purchase requests, confirmations of PO’s, tracking of deliveries, setting and optimizing of safety stock targets, maintenance of indirect material part set ups, handling of receiving discrepancies, and indirect material shortage and expedite management and communication."
good,"great management, relaxed working atmosphere, interesting job, good training."
good,"Great job, Good pay, decent work place and benefits. "
good,typical work day is from early in the morning till afternoon or evening. Unload truck at the stores on delivery route. depending on miles you possibly have a layover. then returning to domicial to take break then return after 10hr break.
good,Ryder is fundamentally an operating company which is very deliberate in managing its customer base.  Not heavily focused on innovation or growth outside its core business
good,Good work environment and everyone works together. Management could be a little more relaxed on some of the thing they do. The good thing is that you don't see very much favoritism.
good,"Ryder is a great place to advance in your training skills. To be able to move up in higher positions. The training is great, it motivate you to wanting to advance within the company."
good,learned safety procedures and correct loading procedures.worked as a team and and independently. drove both hot shot and flatbed trucks. brand new equipment
good,Great atmosphere I have a true love for trucks and making the world go round a typical work day is showing up 15 to 20 minutes early for a safety meeting being briefed on the days work load. Loved being on call very enjoyable good money to be made
good,Nice place to work. A little busy on the shop floor but not to bad. Co workers and management very personable. Safe and enjoyable place to work. You can get plenty of experience working here.
good,"Working at Ryder is both a pleasure and pain. While the working environment was great, and the people too as well, the pay was rather low there on all sides. There was a technician have worked there for 18 years, yet was only getting 18.50 and hour. How is this? They say it was due to the location we were in, but if you went to another city over (who's cost of living was similar to ours) you were automatically giving 5-7 dollars more. Like I said before great environment, great people, not so good pay."
good,Ryder is a great 3pl company to work for. You are given the opportunity to grow within as well as transfer to other facilities. Monthly employee recognition is good.
good,"I work on a order picker , picking parts for companies. I  set them up on GDCSORT 's then they get shipped out. I train people on jobs in the building. I do putaway of inventory. I have learned to work in a warehouse picking and sorting product. The hardest part is dealing with the hot weather and sometimes dealing with management. I do like my job and what I do."
good,Es una empresa con estabilidad laboral ambiente de trabajo bueno.
good,Management needs serious work. People are ok. Work was fairly simple. Good hours. Advancement seemed to be fairly easy. Worst part about this job was definitely the management.
good,"Was a technician for 4 years, loved the people I worked with and trained from. Management was slow to recognize positive work they just care about safety, you could do the wrong thing but as long as you done it safely you were ok. Good benefits and pay just as long as you were willing to put in the hours."
good,"Supervisors and coworkers are easily to work with. Bags and ping pong table available during break. Great hours."
good,Ryder overall is a great company. I did have issues with my current location. Management was the main issue. We had college grads with no experience in this field what so ever running one of the biggest shops. Pay is great. Training is great. Benefits could be better but were ok. Co workers were a blast to work with. Management was tough. they were bosses not leaders. Didn't care to much on the personal level with their employees. Over all though a decent place.
good,This was a unique place to work but fun we started up a division for Ryder truck rental customers and assisted them with finding movers to help them pack and load the household goods.
good,A typical day is self supervision of properly picking up a freight from plant to plant in a safe manor  . Follow all safety rule and regulation.
good,"Rdyder was a contractor for major companies providing temp to perm positions, giving you on the job training, I learned how to operate and drive company vehicles delivering small to large items from one Bellsouth site to another. Operating a bob cat was a requirement to load and unload material. I manned different Bellsouth store rooms, providing customer service, answering phones, filing, typing up reports and mailing out important documents. Each I would come in early to restock the store room, check emails, clean the construction yard, sign material in and out for the contractors. It was never a dull moment, there was always something to do which is what I loved about the job, until I had to work in the rain and mud."
good,"Depends on account, but some are flexible and can achieve great things.  Can work with big sets of data and generate value for the customer.  You will be allowed to grow."
good,"I've worked at ryder for almost 7 months and it is a very decent place to work if you're into the factory setting, it could also be fun at times. around the factory you get a lot of downtime if trucks are late and if broadcast is running slow."
good,Job required a lot of heavy lifting and long hours but the staff made it very easy to get through the day because of their sense of humour and character. Definitely is not my top enjoyable job but taught my a lot general labour skills that could be used at home or future employers.
good,10 rating with salary not full time position leaving looking for a stable job don't like performance with daily tasks when pay is not the best or to low work through temp services.
good,"Over all OK when we had work, and we NEVER new what our next trip would be. No way to plan out trips for the future..."
good,Ryder was a great place to work! My co-workers were helpful and the environment was active and inclusive. Management is approachable and colleagues work together to achieve great customer service!
good,"Ryder is a good place to work"
good,The everyday work is mostly the same every day. we are the cross dock for Honda. we distribute the part from the suppliers to the Honda plants. The other employees are real good to work with along with the management. theirs  not much to learn there is is more of remembering where the parts go from one truck to another and doing it in the time frame you are allowed. the best part of the job is when you and your team mates are all working together and get all the trucks done early.
good,Great company to work for. Great people that make a good work environment. There's always a new task to be resolve on a daily basis.
good,"Les superviseurs tres ouverts, Mon expérience était courte que je n'ai pas pu donner un avis"
good,"Realy good company to work for.good equipment, good pay, leaned a whole lot about the steel business, monthly training was good,"
good,"coworkers didn't take the job seriously. felt kind of like high school. maybe a different location would be better. pay was good, benefits were also good."
good,La empresa da mucha confianza al emplado para poder desenvolverse en el area por el cual es contratado asi como tambien el empleado tiene la confianza de apoyarse de su jefe inmediato para la solucion de problemas que se presentan en el trabajo
good,"I managed 15 to 20 associates for inbound and outbound orders. Received in all inbound as they came in, set up outbounds and made sure all inventory was available. Shipped and labeled Fed Ex orders,"
good,"Can be very fast paced and will find yourself being thrown into the ocean, but if you can challenge yourself it can be very awarding."
good,"Ryder transportation is a fortune 500 company that provides opportunity to professionals around the globe. The environment is very fast paced, fun, and dynamic.  As a front line sales agent you encounter many different issues that mold you into a future leader."
good,"Ryder is a very good place to work, however, if you do your job really well, it's difficult to advance. They seem to prefer hiring from outside rather than taking a chance on current employees."
good,"routed deliveries for brandsmart, made schedule, nice training programs,,,great co workers, "
good,Management is different depends on location and size of shop. Many opportunity to grow but you must also put in a lot of efforts. Turnover rate is also high.
good,"In addition to fueling and washing trucks I was also responsible for changing and/or repairing tires, ordering tires and tire related supplies, receiving tire and fuel deliveries and general shop maintenance. It was a great, friendly environment most of the time. All of my co workers were eager to share their knowledge with me upon request. There was always a new challenge which I enjoyed very much"
good,A day here at Ryder is great. Everyone greets you with a smile and a good morning. The management really takes care and understands the worker's professional and personal lives. My only concern is when you work hard people tend to take advantage of it. They offer overtime which is a huge plus.
good,Ryder is a results driven company that has decent benefits. I enjoyed the people and the organizational structure. Ryder can do better in the area of compensation.
good,I enjoyed my time with Ryder and am trying like crazy to get back in.  It was a clean and fair work environment.  I promoted 2 times in my 5 years with the company.  Its not a perfect company as I experienced some favoritism/politics as far as who gets promoted.  The other issue I have is that I was laid off and was not able to obtain another position within the company even though I had 5 years of experience and nothing but praise from my superiors.
good,"- good growth potential"
good,This is a great company to start out and grow your career.  Ryder focuses on making sure it's technicians and managers get the best and most current training.  Very focused on safety!
good,"Typical day at work was staying very busy, Picked up learning new things very fast and actuate, was hard to take breaks most day but wanted to get worked completed before end of day."
good,"Covered maternity leave here. "
good,"My day begins with checking emails, tying up loose ends from the previous day, and organizing and prioritizing the files that need to be addressed that day. Once the phone calls start coming in, I do whatever it takes to advance the status of the claim, regardless of whether it is my claim or not. I find myself working during my breaks sometimes, or missing my breaks altogether, in an attempt to stay ahead of the consistently growing claim load."
good,"Dedicated lanes with excellent pay and definite planned home-time. Training was sometimes tedious because every month you have training (mostly safety related) and every quarter there was additional training. In the 3 years I was there I never saw a pay raise, but the pay was good. Management changed halfway through my experience there which was disconcerting, but I rolled with it. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing where and when you will be most of the time."
good,"I've always had a passion for people.  Everyday I strive to do the best I can and help others grow and achieve their goals.  My job is very demanding and high stress... I deal with scheduling and often times problems arise consistently and I have to find a way to make everything work.  You will most always see me smiling and laughing even in the midst of the storm, because I know everything does work out in the end.  Also, it is a wonderful thing to know that you have accomplished yet another goal or task successfully."
good,Great job with great people to make work a fun but serious place to work at.
good,Great place to work.management works well with any issues you may have.if you can't do this job probably shouldn't be in a tractor
good,The mechanics were smart and helpful. There were different types of trucks to work on which was interesting.
good,"B2B sales"
good,"A days work starts off with checking inventory, fueling and detailing and management of tools and calibrations. Earned experience in DOT fundamentals and company rules and regulations. Great co-workers, good attitude and willing to help each other. Job can be difficult at times with multiple deadlines and job tasks. Most enjoyable time is when all falls into place with minimal extra effort."
good,"Great Place to work. We would first walk the yard and inventory all trucks. Next we would match the yard check to the online inventory list and assign all rentals for the day. The rest of the day would comprise of completing reservations, tracking down trucks for specific needs and bringing in trucks for the next day. My co- workers were excellent and easy to work with. There are always those times things get stressful but we could always work through the difficulties and accomplish the job. The hardest part of the job was having an empty yard and a customer comeing in last minute and needing a truck. We never liked saying no to a customer."
good,"Every day there was plenty of work to do during my tenure, there  were many multiple opportunities to gain more experience in different aspects that were unavailable in other lines of work.  The management was mainly supportive and encouraged the employees to improve on a regular basis.  The co-workers were friendly and easy going once they observed the fact that a new person was there to pull their own weight and not slack off.  The hardest part of working there was that you were constantly under the electronic eye of a computed time for a task. If it took too long for a task, questions would be asked as too what took so long, and if the task was completed in a shorter time than planned, doubts of the job being done right would be raised.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that the supervisor allowed each mechanic or technician the space and time to complete the tasks that they had."
good,"La dirección general mis mas grandes respetos para el sr. Gerente ya que no había conocido a ninguno como el.  Te saluda, te apoya , te pregunta como te sientes, incluso en momentos de mucho trabajo ayuda y mete las manos por cumplir los objetivos de la empresa."
good,"Started on fuel island and quickly worked my way into the shop through Ryder's training classes which enhance DOT Specs as well as combines the Manufacturer's classes. Good place to start, you'll get a broad range of jobs varying from trailer/tractor pm's all the way up to engine diagnostics and overhaul."
good,I move trailers on a schedule. I have a set dock I cover. I stay busy doing my job to the best of my ability. I enjoy driving the truck and being a team player.
good,"great company  to work for long hour and steady work as long as they have the contracts. Hard to say about co-workers I was the only person on acct, and never met my superviser  face to face only on phone."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo "
good,"Ryder was a company that advance my skills. A job that I would like to go back to if the opportunity was available. The job was a challenging experience with working with sometimes difficult people, but rewarding."
good,Worked with a great team. Learning new things everyday. Looked forward to going to work because of the stucture.
good,Getting to know the students you transport.  Going with your co-worker on charters.  Having to write up students.
good,"Working for Ryder Logistics was a great experience. Working with my team always made me feel as if i were part of a work family. The management was great and My Co-worker were hard workers and cooperative. The hardest part of my job was checking in material because it would come in on big pallets of heavy cardboard boxes and plastic bins that were around 30 lbs, and that i would have to lift. The most enjoyable part of my day would be when i would be able know i put in a good days work and was appreciated for it."
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Work schedule is good. Good work environment."
good,"Must perform and must meet goals."
good,"good people,,good work,-to much work lots was sent out to be repaired. Bad timing on my part we tried to do what we could- upper mamnagement was being rearranged at the time also,,lots of new people just learning the job- overal learned alot, pay was good, didn't have any problems."
good,"I learned a lot about the transportation world. They taught me how to Monitor all truckloads, to and from the GM, build routes, in-transits, charter freights, border crossing and handles all breakdown issues. Set up expedites, track MGO, track bill Of Lading, traveled to different plants to introduce and explain our LMS system. Handled all issues with carries, made sure everything was running properly or would have to use disciplinary action."
good,Loved my job but our department was relocated to another state and we all lost our jobs.
good,Very positive to help develop my sales proficiency at the company.
good,"I held several different positions at Ryder. Ryder introduced me to the automotive industry, and opened many doors for opportunities. It was a privilege being on Ryders team."
good,Overall my experience at Ryder has been genuinely valuable and educational. I have had the opportunity to learn about the transportation industry and put my own touch on each of the positions I have had. I would recommend working for the company as long as you are dedicated to learning the business and a strong worker.
good,One of the best employers I have worked with. Plenty of work and time off at home. Wish outside conditions had not encouraged me to leave.
good,I like my job if you got a problem Ryder gets on right away.training is good but the last job i was doing in 13 hours I feel it was comprimising safety
good,ordering parts creating purchase orders through enrich systems
good,"When I first started in Safety, the district had authoization to pay a liability claim up to $250. Anything over that amount that amount needed to go to the claims office. I certified drivers to meat DOT rules. I ordered driving records frorm the state for Ryder insured customrs"
good,"I have worked for Ryder for 25 years. A few times over those years, my job was either eliminated or migrated to Ryder's Shared Service Center in Georgia. Rather than lose me and my experience with Ryder, management has found (or created) a job for me. Unfortunately, Ryder recently cut a set number of employees."
good,"Repair heavy duty vehicles and trailers. To deal with customer at different job sites, Knowledgeable, Good coworkers, Bad weather,Learning to do new repairs."
good,"Tipical day monitor parts and trucks to GM assembly parts, fast pace enviroment."
good,"I enjoy dirty jobs. Changing oil and fixing trucks, the challenge of finding the problem is very interesting and fun to me. I learned alot about different ways to repair or replace things on diesel/auto vehicles. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"Great pay, good investment in people excellent facilities and equipment. "
good,The downfault of working for Ryder was that I had to buy my own tools when needed whether weekly or now items we needed. So my take home salary was much lower than anticipated.
good,Customer service skills a must. Timely delivery schedules daily. Attention to delivered freight as multiple stops in trailer. Safe operation of lift gate to remove freight from trailer.
good,"Worker comfort provided, fair pay and hard work is acknowledged by supervisor. I would recommend this job to those willing to work in group effort since the workload is teamwork dependent."

good,Typed notes from doctors notes on claims. Input payments for bills.
good,"Great safety and Lean culture. Good Management team, in the higher levels. Inexperienced lower level supervisors."

good,"Typical day at work consist of providing transportation to lease, business, and personal customers on regular basis. Meeting everyday objectives. Handling objections. Provide a safe environment for me as well as my employees."
good,I have no comment at this time. This is was a good learing experience in dealing with customer on a global range
good,"Good working environment, opportunity for advancement, good work life balance."
good,"Ryder is a well run truck leasing company that insists on diversity in hiring and employee advancement."
good,Everything at the job was very good very simple.  The management definitely could use some more work but for the most part the job was excellent and there people were very helpful. Eager to help u learn.
good,"I would not have left if it weren't for an issue with my CDL.  As soon as my suspension is lifted, I will be reapplying at the same account (and maybe others nearby)."
good,This is a good company with excellent benefits. Promotions are limited in certain locations as management usually has long tenure. In 16 years I have not witnessed a lay off.
good,Ryder took quality and safety seriously and modern tools to get the work done.  The manager was great. He would listen to complaints if there were any. Very fair.
good,I am a hard worker and willing to work long hours because I'm the kind of person I don't like asking anybody for anything so I like to work for everything that I get.
good,"Ryder overall was a good company, with good benefits and time off the routes were good except when change of management and dispatchers but overall I’d recommend anyone looking for employment the ryder company the other drivers were helpful with communication with each other , monthly safety course online helped refresh drivers of safe work practices ."
good,I enjoyed working there the people were very honest and great people great job I would go back if i could! All of the managers very cool very flexible with the hours and work!
good,Good Company to work for and great opportunity for advancement many branches and locations to apply at. Pay is decent and work culture is great and very resourceful.
good,"Almost like any other warehouse/factory.  Do your job correctly and you’ll be left alone, but if your a slacker they will be watching you.  Not the best place because tons of gossiping but not the worst place either."
good,"Fun-and secure place to work!"
good,It was a fun place to work. I made several friends there. The work was steady because trucks were always coming in to be refueled.The pay was good and there was room for advancement.
good,Enjoyed my time with Ryder.  The three day work week was a good perk.  I like that I was able to easily interact with management and that my opinions were heard.
good,"I worked only one summer at this warehouse and fully intended to stay until my mother became ill. While there I was given opportunities to shine by giving suggestions to organize my department's floor layout better. I felt acknowledged by the upper staff, and my immediate supervisor(s) were always available if needed. I was paid less due to being hired through a temp agency, but after only a few weeks I was told that Ryder very much wanted to hire me directly and put me on a path to eventually join management, which would've meant a lot more money. "
good,Ryder was a good company with excellent benefits for the long haul. Didn't really make much to show for in the present. Good group of guys and great management. Poor advancement. I stayed in the same position for almost 4 years and I just had to move on.
good,"Flexible hours, travel, working onsite with customers.  The company has many benefits and opportunities for advancement.  The only drawback are the number of meetings, depending on the size of the account.  Trying to balance work and personal life can become an issue, however, it is manageable.  I would recommend this company for those who are driven and self-sufficient."
good,it was a fun job because of the people i worked with. it was a over all pretty good place to work. management was very well teamed together and was will to stick up for you.
good,no real issues at Ryder the job is very fast paced and constantly changing with customers and drivers coming in all the time and this is what I enjoy. Lots of interactions with the main customers and a lot of responsibility and constantly changing. I don't have any issues with ryder
good,Working with management at Ryder Integrated was a big reason  to have worked with there for all those years. Ryder gave the opportunity to do other activities.
good,"Acquire trips every week, secure loads and take care of business with little or no management interference.  Drivers are left with responsibility of completing all paperwork for routes dispatched."
good,I like this job dispatch works with you when need a weekend off our GM is a good person as well very good equipment get along with all employees no drama at this company plenty of benefits.
good,A day at Ryder could be pretty mellow but at times it can be stressful. Especially for Pool Driver that get switch from different accounts everday or week.
good,"Ryder was one of the best job that i've ever had.. Any job where u get to work with your mind is a plus to me. Leaving their because of family reason, was hard for me. I would go be in second if i could..."
good,"This was a very nice place to work. However, 2nd shift became a problem for me. Just working and seeing different truck drivers come and go was amazing."
good,"Its a good company to work for. I learned a lot about transportation and logistics, supply chain, network design and analysis, different carrier modes, dealing with operators, customers, management alike."
good,"I enjoy working for Ryder, the culture fits my lifestyle. The SSC is a very relaxed environment. Overall management is concern about growth and development for all."
good,Great place ever to work very structured and a lot of great people. Very process driven and a process for everything. Great customers and friendly staff. Training is probably the best that I have ever seen in any company. A lot of room to progress and a advance. Great support systems in place. Great benefits.
good,Solid company and management but you better know your stuff.  Ryder is a leader in logistics and it is a great opportunity to grow and learn.  They use lean very effectively in a logistics setting and push to be a leader in safety.
good,Fantastic place to work grow and be productive. Everybody is great management has a good since of the environment and allows everyone the opportunity to be creative.
good,I had a very challenging job at Ryder. I learned so much from this job and boresome is impossible because this is a fast-paced and busy place to work with.
good,I love my co-workers everyone simply haves fun and the job goes by fast. They also give reasonable breaks and would recommend this job
good,"The job requires you to run your own business. You are in charge of pricing, inspecting, maintaining, tracking, and most importantly selling Ryders trucks (assets). This requires much communication with shops, vendors, and management on a constant basis. Problem solving is a must for the job."
good,The thing I enjoyed most about Volkswagen was the friendliness in the work place along with the up beat work attitudes. I was all to go to work everyday no dreading coming in and as well as get my job done quick and efficient.
good,Siempre se capacita al personal y se les da la información completa sobre las actividades a desarrollar.
good,I can only speak for the account that I work for. My account manager is the best. He really care for the drivers that has his back and do their best to support the customer. I have no complaints at all.
good,I would load and unload trailers and clear the packing floor. I learned how to drive a forklift and the management was good to work for
good,"A typical workday can get kind of repetitive, but there again you can't really expect much else from a warehouse. The work is easy to grasp and there isn't really a supervisor breathing down your neck all day long. I learned many things there, how to operate stand up forklifts of all sizes, how to properly archive shipping orders, how to locate and replenish depleted product bays, and how to stage shipments in an orderly fashion. Overall I enjoyed working here and if I could do so again I would in a heartbeat. The management is pretty solid, though if we're being completely honest, they really didn't acquiesce to any requests from the workers in a timely manner. You just sort of told them what was needed and they got to it when they got to it. It kind of interfered with productivity a little bit, but it wasn't to the point where it needed to be reported or anything crazy. The co-workers in the warehouse were very diverse. Most of the workers were Mexican or African American, and as such there was almost never a dull moment when in the lunch room. They would all have interesting stories about different aspects of their respective cultures and they were great conversationalists. The hardest part in my opinion about the job was trying to make rate. Being a material handler, you were expected to stack, wrap, and stage 3000 cases of product per shift simply to make rate. I did the math and that means just to make rate during a 10 hour shift, one would need to pick 6 boxes per minute non stop all shift long. including break and lunch. There was no margin for stacking time, wrapping"
good,"Ryder is a good company to work for, but, if on the dedicated side of the business, it all depends on who is the customer. Ryder has plenty of opportunity around the country to advance your career."
good,Challenging and professional development is always expected. Safety is the primary focus. Self motivated and working independently is a plus.
good,"It was a great company to work for, like i said it helped me challenge myself and helped my improve my ability to work. But over all a great work place just needs better management."
good,Great Company within the community.  Enjoyed providing Customer Service to various customers.  Satisfaction at end of day.
good,"My time at Ryder has taught me many things how to be a leader,  how to work as a team, multi tasking just to name a few.  "
good,Excellent place to work. Management is experienced and cares about employee growth. Earning potential is very high. The hardest part of the job is trying not to work over 60 hours and making time for yourself.
good,"Treats employees fairly, like family, friendly work atmosphere."
good,"i enjoyed my job with this company, this company is a company i would love to go back and work for an then retire from. the people the customers were all outstanding and super nice."
good,"Follow up on materials to make sure that they are arriving on time, while avoiding dock delays and no stock."
good,Good job for diesel & heavy truck technicians. In house training in about one year.
good,Always looking for a new challenge to become success in the work  place.
good,It was a great company to work for and I learned a lot from my co-workers.
good,"I learned a lot about the transportation world. They taught me how to Monitor all truckloads, to and from the GM, build routes, in-transits, charter freights, border crossing and handles all breakdown issues. Set up expedites, track MGO, track bill Of Lading, traveled to different plants to introduce and explain our LMS system. Handled all issues with carries, made sure everything was running properly or would have to use disciplinary action."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Ryder; however, I was a little disappointed that they eliminated a position after 15 months."
good,you work your day and would get praise for completeling stuff. learned how to deal with unforeseend issues. supervisors where down to earth and willing to help
good,"A typical day at work was standing in the line, picking products into boxes. What I have learned while working in Ryder is how to be more focused while picking products into boxes so that everything goes where it has to go. The management was very good. The co-workers were co-operative which made the job very easy.The hardest part of the job was scanning the products. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers."
good,Ryder is a very good place to work. The experience was very positive.
good,I enjoy working for Ryder. My current issue is that i drive more than 35 miles one way to work location. Management is more than fair and will treat you with respect.
good,A wonderful job to work for. Management is reliable for any assistance. Normally early hours and possibly late days. Dispatch normally communicate pretty well with drivers.
good,Great place to work. Good co-workers and management wasn’t just there for a check. They would at times come out to the shop and give us a hand if needed
good,"Since phones aren't allowed on the floor, you won't know the times for lunch or breaks so if you're still out working during lunch, if u clock out at 12:15 u still have to clock in at 12:30 instead of 12:45 in order to get the whole 30 minutes. If not that counts as half a point it goes towards your attendance"
good,"Ability to:"
good,"During my typical work day, I would show up around 630 am and back my truck into the loading dock. After I was loaded I would secure my load and be on my way to make my delivery. Some times the loading process would take a bit longer than necessary, but usually, things went smooth throughout the day."
good,"as a team driver i had a lot of fun.  when i was a solo driver it was the same old same old every day,,.. i would go back in a heart beat. as a team driver. only in S.A. the office people are fun. and make it fun when you go in there. but how ever they do need to work on knowing what to say to the drivers when they call in. and not say just what ever comes to mind.. drivers are away from home and some times just need to be reasured all good and things didnt change.."
good,"Work life balance, flexibility in schedule, honest management, challenging work, relaxed environment are strong points. However, the pay is below industry standards. Additionally this is no formal training program for anything. No tuition reimbursement."
good,I would pull orders and sometimes even take them to the airport. Generating orders out of the computer to be picked and also dealing with customer requests timely. lots of variety with size of parts picked and packed.
good,"Worked in Jacksonville, FL terminal. Great work environment. Easy going dispatchers. Deliveries were easy. Early start time and early off to spend time with family"
good,Great job for students right out of college. I worked morning shift with weekends off. Would of preferred a higher salary for the role and responsibility of the job. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful.
good,"Leaving was a mistake.  Great company, great atmosphere.  Pride is common among employees.  People who leave often return and you commonly find people who have parents and children who also work for the company."
good,Normally is an eight hour work day. As long as you do your part the job is very easy. Hardest part of the job is switching hours. After working there for awhile everyone makes u fell right at home.
good,"My day starts with building the drivers schedule, dispatching them out, making sure all runs are completed with no issues. The most enjoyable part of my job is the drivers and their sense of dedication to their work. I have a great team and we couldn't succeed without the drivers."
good,"Completed preventive maintenance on diesel and gasoline vehicles"
good,"I come in early in the a.m.to get the day started,which requires me to check my load,strap it down and make my deliveries for the day.Once I am finished for the day,I am to call dispatch for further instructions, I learned a lot about the product we deliver,how to identify the different lumber we deliver.Work culture was okay,no complaints.The hardest part was tarping the loads.The most enjoyable part was seeing different places.I really liked the job indeed."
good,"Working for Ryder was great, I had hands on training the sent me to classes, I had a great service manager, it was fast pace so it kept the day moving quick. I learned a lot in my time with Ryder they had me doing the same thing so I was always learning something new plus i was never bored. If i had to recommend a place to work for diesel technician it would be the place I would talk to them about."
good,"It was nice working in the same office as the upper management staff . A typical day would include assisting users, running/patching cables configuring phones, etc."
good,This is a team enviroment with expectations of a fair days pay for a fairs day work. People are key because they are the face of the company and the driving force behind it.
good,Work hard and know your job and you'll advance. It's like any other job. Work hard and it pays off. If your just trying to collect a paycheck you'll never get anywhere you wanna be
good,I would do a quality assessment on my hilo before the start of my shift. then I would get a cmc shipping order from my team leader and stage it for the next day. When done with those i would unload or load a truck and put product in the right location.
good,"I enjoyed speaking to Customers daily , Chasing outstanding payments and making payment arrrangements for those in financial difficulities via email ,telephone and postal services."
good,"Busy and multi-task, take charge of any situations, work well in management or teams, professional but have good communication with all levels of the organization"
good,"Busy  work place  but rewarding...Wonderful  group of co-workers  who  became friends and  family. "
good,"Southeast Construction Products is a very serious company, everything is about customer service, and employees. Keeping a company strong and learning."
good,Productive environment with dedicated employees and great work/life balance.  Most challenging part of the job relates to lack of common understanding around vision and goals.
good,Ryder is a great environment that creates a lot of opportunities for those that are able to relocate for available positions. They have managed to create teams with a lot of tenure and local support does put the individual before the company.
good,A typical day At Ryder Logistics was fun! You work and socialize with co workers. Everyone got along. So that made the day go by fast. You were in and out in no time.
good,Fair compensation. Micromanaged at every level. Every part of the business is highly monitored and graded creating a high stress work environment.
good,"The workday begins very informally at the rental counter in greeting the agents and signing in. There is small talk about the proposed moves of rental vehicles and I settle in and wait and listen for the instructions."
good,"Great job, great health care and 401 K.   Paid holidays.  Local and team routes. Bid on routes every 1-2 months.  Newer trucks low miles. Good base pay."
good,"Productive workplace with bright, helpful co-workers always willing to take initiative or assist with any issue that may arise"
good,"Some days be ruff and some days can be easy, I learn a lot working with Ryder. I learn how to change the tires on the trucks plus the different parts of the trucks. Management did there part of being a manager. Co-workers are team players that will help you a lot. the hardest part of working is dealing with the weather. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid every week."
good,"Was busy and kept me on my toes. Always active which was nice. Got stressful, but part of what kept it interesting. Co-worker were great and overall the company was great too. Just to far of a commute after I relocated."
good,"Great place to work. They are very willing o work with your life schedule. It is a fast pace environment, but the people make the time fly by. This company really pays you to think."
good,I would go in everyday they would have a team meeting telling everyone what job they have. I usually had the same job everyday. the co workers was nice to be around. management was good.
good,"Will get the good experience from this organisation."
good,Great job to have in this area. Lots of job security and a very fast paced environment.
good,"Start work @ 7 - 3:30"
good,The work day went by pretty fast because the work was rapid and it was pretty much the same daily. Management was laid back but they wasn't really around to help solve problems. Hardest part of the job was breaks due to the long lines. The most enjoyable part was operating the forklifts.
good,"Dealing with the customer , looking after 35 truck drivers daily. Deal with customer inquires."
good,I had fun doing work experience at Ryder Truck Rental and took part in a few different things.
good,"Great family vibe, good benefits, great incentives, consistent hours, consistent job duties, good opportunities for advancement, consistent retraining, you met a lot of new people, still had time to spend with my own children."
good,"Very good company to work for, the people work with you, very professional. My ultimate goal is to be local, they fly to other accounts so im not always home, but closest to local i've been since i've been a driver."
good,I’ve worked with Ryder for 5 years. Ryder provides great opportunities and promotes within. The company has a tendency to stretch people thin every now and then and is a little behind when it comes to IT solutions compared to other competitors. This is may be due to the some of the leadership that is in place however. That being said I can honestly say that Ryder has set me up for success overall and is a great place to work.
good,every month you bid a route. so if you wish to run at different hours or more money. You may have a chance to improve your job situation. Most trucks are automatics. and they are nice and fairly new.
good,"Will wear many hats, field managers do not have corp assistant, you will run your account as if your the owner."
good,"Ryder is a company where you walk in to the office building and every employee in there greets you with a smile. My team welcomed me with big arms and made sure that my experience would not only be memorable, but would also help me grow."
good,"I was always under good management and they were there to help and guide me. I enjoyed going to work everyday and enjoyed what I did. Always had a great team that worked for me and made my job easier, was able to build my team myself and structured them to be good at what they did. Most enjoyable part was having a good relationship with all the other departments Supervisors and their team members. Ryder was a great place to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone in our location.  There were a lot of weekly reports which were never a problem.  Manager was always busy, but would call back and offer assistance."
good,"I love what I did and the drivers!  They provided work/family balance and great hours 6:30am - 3 pm M-F plus only 12 minute driver from home!  The environment is very fast paced and you have to think outside the box to make collaborative decisions, but I happen to like that!"
good,"Typically worked 8hr days from 10pm to 6:30am."
good,spent a lot of time doing computer work due to record and time management. enjoyed the job but the cost of fuel tripled and I had just purchased a new home so I was not able to relocate. great opportunity for growth and learning.
good,"This is a great company to work for long term. However, the pay could be be better. Over all a great day to day work place to commit to when it comes to the people and work load."
good,Empresa multinacional na área de Logística. Grande experiência e oportunidade de crescimento.
good,"keeping machines running while inspected product every 30min an keeping area clean an tracking the production percentage"
good,"Great people, the management good, the pay was good, and I liked the way they treated their employees. I had no problems their company."
good,"una empresa dedicada al trabajo de la longistica de la cual saco muy bien el trabajo, es una empresa la cual siempre vio por el trabajador es una empresaes la cual cre en el trabajador para la superacion tanto del trabajador como de la empresa misma, es una empresa la cual inculco en ver por el futuro de cada persona por elmedio de la dedicacion al trabajo y aciendo bien las cosas laborales  asi como personale, "
good,"Ryder felt like a career, always made you feel like you were important to the company and the job you did mattered.   they ensured you had the proper equipment, your truck was operating properly and if not it was fixed in a timely manner"
good,Ryder prepares you for your job on a daily basis. Ryder educate their employees and teaches them to be the best at what they do. The employees enjoyed coming to work and they understood the importance of teamwork.
good,"un dia normal en ryder es inspeccionar vehiculos para que cumplan con los estandarez de calidad y asi puedan salir de la empresa y ser vendidos, lo que mas aprendi fui a no pasar por alto ninguna anormalidad en el producto ya que calidad del servicio habla de como eres, los colegas en el trabajo son buenas personas siempre se trabaja en un clima de respeto y tolerancia."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at RYDER last year. Even though it was through an assignment, I was made to feel like I was a part of ""RYDER nation"". Large company with a feeling of a close knit family setting made each employee love coming to work within our department. - Billing Center"
good,"-I was allowed to work the hours I need, received proper training for any addition work, and was allowed to learn things beyond the scope of my job requirements"
good,Great place to work at. Company had man opportunities for advancement.
good,"great training, coworkers, lots of on the job learning. Very focused on PM's."
good,"I worked second shift, so I started at 3:30pm and stayed until midnight. My position was to run the fuel island and truck wash. This location did not really need a fuel island attendant, because I think at MOST, I had one truck every other hour rolling up to the pumps. The wash bay got better after I got there as it was previously being used for maintenance and overflow of parts, but that was fixed very promptly after a meeting. With that said, meetings are monthly and progress DOES get made with meetings. The management team is very good and they know every aspect of their position. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a certain co-worker who always seemed to be in my business, but other than that it was a great place. If you can deal with grease all over you all the time, then you will make it here."
good,"is a good place to work, learned how to bo safe and get things done on time making costumer happy with the job well done, manegement the best people that i've been worked for, always learning something new with other drivers, its not hard, driving is always fun..."
good,i had a great experience with ryder great co-workers. If they had a job opening i would definitely re-apply for the rental rep position.
good,Ryder does care about there personal and there benefits are good.however unless your a mechanic they do not have rewards for service employees.It also takes them awhile to hire help. There is always plenty of work to do so you always get your hours and some overtime now and then
good,Great place to work at Management gives you the autonomy to think for yourself and be creative. There is a lot of reorganization in HR and change is good.
good,"Great place To Work Great People On Both Sides In Management "
good,"love working there, never boring always something to do, good training if you want it, uniforms provided, good insurance and benefits, good pay, great people"
good,Ryder is an excellent company to work for. My issue locally is working at a captive location you end up doing the work of 3 employees due to the amount of revenue generated. It is also highly stressful due to essentially working for two companies.
good,Ryder was a very nice place to work. I loved it. Managers were always courteous and would help whenever needed. Pay was very fair and competitive. Overtime was plentiful.
good,"I loved working at Ryder as an Account Manager. Was not easy and the selling was very demanding due to the highest priced in the market. Great commission reward. Overall, was a great company to work for as long as you are willing to put in the hours. The job can be very stressful if you do not have a supporting team on your rental counter. They can make or break you. Worked 3 different locations in 3 different states and only came across one person that was hard to work with. Great Managers in the company. Would work here again."
good,"Good place to work. My manager gave me the freedom, to run my branch as I saw fit, and within reason. I was allowed to make decisions that I saw, needed to be made at that precise moment with no negative feedback. I would arrive at work, already aware of what was going on, because of setting up the next days activities, the evening before leaving, Only real difficult part of job was, having equipment being removed that you already had assigned to incoming customers. Thereby, competing with 3 other locations, already in short supply of that particular truck. Easy environment. Everyone seemed to get along. I worked hand and hand with mechanics, service manager to maintain a certain ""preventive maintenance goal""."
good,"Good Company to work for and Team is Awesome."
good,"Clock in. Check personnel and work load, distribute amongst team. Go to Production meeting, discussing the workload the day before, that day, and days ahead. Management was involved in all aspects of the warehouse. Coworkers worked to the best of their ability and were rewarded. Company purchased Treadmills, Pool table, Ping Pong table, Dart board, Workout machine and cable television."
good,"They were Excellent at Providing Safety Boots/ They Had Company Lunches, You Got Noticed for Your Performance, Excellent Benefits, Me & My Supervisor Had a Great Employee/Supervisor Understanding in Certain Areas of The Company. The Job Wasn't Hard, You Had to Pay Close Attention To Detail.Like I Did."
good,ryder is a great company to work for. they pay well. the work place is easy going. they treat their employees well. you get paid time off and they offer lots of overtime.
good,This employer was amazing to work for. I would have loved to be able to grow with them and learn other trades within the company. I do wish some company policies were different.
good,Excellent salary and benefits.  Great company culture and management is fine.  Very large glass ceiling for women.  Great company culture.
good,"Little to no communication with employees, need more people that want to work. Management cannot seem to get their head out of their butts. Not worth it."
good,Not a good place to work managerment don't care about the drivers and do not try to get or give us raises  or care about getting us home to be with our families
good,"They need to catch up with the times and understand that change is needed to grow and that people do actually still lie, even management.  With that said, each facility has its own issues from favouritism tio drama.  If they don't like you, you don't get a fair chance at having a carrier there."
good,"Ryder is a great place to begin but there is no room for advance opportunities. Once you reach a top pay that is it.. "
good,"I move to Yuma because I got this job worked there for two months and they started laying off drivers it was by seniority..."
good,"a typical day at work you start with some stretches in the morning to be ready to start working, My lead used to be pretty outgoing and i loved showing up every single day"
good,I worked hard and learned many things about a warehouse even forklift driving. I didn't like that it was layoffs every other month so you really didn't know if you had a job long term or not. Management was not helpful and no where to be found in time of need. When you have questions for them you did not get a answers for weeks. Fun place to work at but very stressful job.
good,"Typical 8 hr shift due to cutting overtime. Since ive been working with Ryder ive learned a lot, but not because of Ryder. It has been thanks to the second shift tech in charge that i have learned a lot of what i know now. Its not a bad place to work. But if you like having a life, dont get stuck on second shift. I feel like i have no life and in order to have a life i require taking time off work. Which leads to using my vacation time to just enjoy the after noon with the family vs actually going on a trip..."
good,"Always busy receiving trailers into location, verifying all incoming material and parts, received and ASN all BOL for billing purposes. I enjoyed being Active and learning new things everyday. I multitask with other departments like shipping"
good,I enjoyed the time I spent at this company. The Rockford location was where I was stationed and all of the employees inside of this building were amazing. This company was one of my favorite employers.
good,it was good working there but the management suck they didnt know how to run any thing.
good,Upper management is terrible. Dog eat dog environment. Numbers game. Customers come second. Senior managers / Directors will walk on employees to climb the corporate ladder. No job security as they play a numbers game to make themselves look good. The customers pay for good service and the employees are not given the resources to deliver. Make the CEO and stock holders rich no matter what the cost.
good,Delivering to customers on a regular basis meant getting to know them and understanding their requirements. Therefore providing good customer service.
good,Loved working in the GM Lake Orion facility. The GM employees were amazing and eager to train and teach new things
good,"I enjoy working for Ryder, The Company is reputable and reliable. My experiences have taught me a lot related to Transportation Managment. At this time , my life goals are redirecting my geographic stability. If I could accomplsh any goal, it would be to remain with Ryder, the interference is simply that my experience with transporation managment within the company is limited to the region I cuurently reside in . Ryder is a great open door for anyone interested Logistics in Transportation Managment."
good,* Dispatched 17 regional and OTR drivers.
good,Ryder was a great place to work. Like family. Easy going and understanding supervisors. Fair pay and good benefits. Overall a very nice place to have worked

good,I loved the job but I'm no longer at that company i do miss the work but not that company it was a difference in the environment and my supervisor and I didnt get along
good,"Hi Everyone"

good,Great place to work. Easy routes. You will be home everyday. The trucks are well maintained. The office personal are easy to get along with. no touch freight.
good,Ryder was great. The management was impeccable. The subcontracted warehouse was sometimes uneasy to work with at times because you had to be the in between of the two companies. But overall good place to learn and travel.
good,"Ryder is a excellent company to work for due to the supervision, company policies, and the training received. All two of my years that I have been employed with Ryder have been amazing."
good,"Paid training, career opportunities, awesome co workers, everyday is a learning experience no matter your level of experience! Many locations across the U.S and Canada!"
good,"I appreciate the opportunity and experience they gave me. I enjoyed my working environment, my co workers, and the job. I left because I relocated to another state."
good,"Was an amazing place to work and I finally found somewhere I felt at home. "
good,"Safety of employees and general public seems to be the theme for Ryder!  Great DOT training for their driver's!  It was reassuring to be working for them and I enjoyed it!  I had to relocate to home, so unfortunately I had to quit. : ("
good,"Great company to work for. Worked for Ryder from 1996-2000, Boyd Coffee,  2014-2017, C and S account . Team driver, best driving position I have every had. They set the bar pretty high. They don't play games, they will tell you how much you will make, time off, everything is as stated. The managers will work with you, I cant say enough about  Ruder."
good,"I started working for Ryder 1999 to 2013, retired after that I work part time. After that I work from 2013 to 2018 part time. Transfer trailer and tucks. to Ryder location."
good,"There are lots of opportunities to advance if you are willing to put the time and effort to learn about the industry and process. However, the positions are designed for growth, and there are few long term opportunities."
good,"It's been a great job for a long time. Good local and regional routes with fair pay and benefits. Can't complain. Good co-workers, updated equipment and paid holidays."
good,Great company to work for. Great team; supportive management. Excellent place to learn new skills in your department as well as others. Cross training encouraged
good,"Ryder was great, the job gave me good work experience. Friendly atmosphere. Able to work independently. Received lots of praise on a job well done from both the management and workers."
good,Fun place to work and have enjoyed the people and hour.  New management did a lot of trial by error but what started as annoyance turned to sound practices.
good,"Lots of work to do, never a dull moment. Great people, good hours,"
good,"Ce n'était que pour faire un stage, ils sont vraiment strict sur la sécurité des employés."
good,"empresa agradavel de trabalhar , com oportunidade de crescimento"
good,Fair workplace to work at. Like most companies today time and money have become the priority in getting the units back to the customer. Would recommend.
good,"A typical day is normally easing going once you get a hang of things there at company, options are available to move up in company. Overall its a good company"
good,I did not enjoy working here over time. this place does not value its employees. the shifts aren't compatible for a person that has a family. I give this job 5 thumbs down.
good,"A typical day at work, Packing toys at first then I was promoted to a Clamp/ Forklift Driver, and I cleaned locations filled with random items together. I learned how to be a good quick packer, then I learned how to be very experienced using a Clamp and a Forklift. I was then able to manage the RF Gun to a very high skilled level very quick. Management should be kind very outgoing and great at communicating with others and also good listeners. The hardest part of the job its trying not to knock down the piles of boxes or pack the wrong item in the wrong place. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting all the work done very smooth and paced."
good,"Belle ambiance de travail "
good,"Each day consists of daily reports, marketing, as well as customer service on the front line and working with the maintenance team. Much of the responsibilities are fleet management, working with customers to ensure all of their needs are met, as well as daily reports kept up to date."

good,Te permite tener equilibrio de vida laboral y personal y promuevo el crecimiento de sus empleados.
good,Great company to work for.  I worked with a great team of coworkers and supervisors in a warehouse setting.  There were alot of changes while I was working there and we worked as a team to make everything work.
good,Upper management are very down to earth. Work is tough but you get out of it what you put in. There is plenty of opportunities to advance in whichever career path you choose.
good,Good company however they need to focus more on the work/life balance of their employees. The equipment is well maintained and facilities are everywhere so there is little down time if you breakdown.
good,"Great place to work and great co workers. Company takes care of their employees. "
good,"Loved processing claims, filing, taking incoming and outgoing calls, providing good customer services to clients.  Love being a team player helping each other getting the work out in a timely matters."
good,Very friendly work environment nice and clean work space nice break rooms and it had a food trunk for lunch every now and then
good,The people in all areas of the company are laid back and down to earth.  The training is outstanding. And the benefits are good. I really enjoyed working there.
good,"Fair,honest,stellar.   Treats employees well...Tries to accomodate workers with respect to their personal lives...Safe ,friendly environment...bilingual, equal opportunity employer."
good,This company is great to work for.  The pay is competitive and the people couldn't be nicer. Great benefits and satisfying work.
good,It keeps you busy. It keeps my mind on track.  You get to meet new people. Also get to work plenty of overtime. The pay isn't too bad. I think of it as a challenge.
good,"The hardest part of the job was finding tasks to do throughout the day.  The work I did was spread off and on through the day and was sometimes slow depending on holidays and seasons.  I liked the management; they treated me well and fair.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with the truck drivers and accomplishing what they wanted done to their vehicle, whether I needed to completely wash it or simply do small checkups, i.e, check oil, check tire pressure, etc.  I learned how to properly manage the resources I had on hand, and I learned how to work as a team better.  My typical day at work is to fuel tractor/trailers, wash box trucks, trailers, trucks, work vans, and walk-ins.  I had to take care of the wash bay and maintain a clean environment.  I kept the yard clean while on duty, and I assisted mechanics if they needed help, like taking an oil filter to the crusher and disposing of it properly so they did not have to stop their work."
good,"Ryder is a great place to work in, people are friendly and always willing to help when asked. Everyone is understandable when it comes to work hours and are will to cooperate with you."
good,"En todos los rubros le doy 5 estrellas en una empresa fabulosa, con buen ambiente y con amplio sentido humano"
good,We also do something called points where we will play small quiz games and if you were right  you would get points but we only do that some times
good,"I was recently laid off as the Sales Administrator Coordinator for Ryder Transportation.  I was absolutely devastated as I exceled in this position and most of all loved administratively supporting the Ryder Sales Team in their truck lease deals. I gained a wealth of knowledge in sales and my background is extensive in administration. I am a people person, highly analytical, and love working with people.  My ideal work environment is one of integrity, respect of one another, and continuous growth through creating an empowering work environment. I do not believe in micromanaging but rather working with employees on accountability and creating a culture based on positive reinforcement.  I would expect my supervisor to respect these values and I do the same.  I have years of experience and have found that this model is most successful. I am now looking for a similar position with a reputable company."
good,Ryder is a good work place they worked really well with my schedule I learned a lot working there as far as how to properly load and unload a truck and how to also use an rf scanner
good,"I've been a driver for Ryder for a long time  and can't really complain.Good  company, good equipment, and great pay! But working for a logistics company you can get tired of going from account to account if that  account you are on doesn't renew the contract with Ryder."
good,First thing in the morning at work I did was check my work email to see if I needed to take care of anything urgent and schedule my day accordingly. management is friendly and easy to work with. Co-workers are friendly to work with and very helpful.
good,Fun place to work at with easy going management. Everyone seems to enjoy coming into work and gets along with everyone. Ryder does take good care of their employees even as far as feeding them weekly.
good,"Working at Ryders on Main I have learned several things. I have learned office management as well as every day tasks to run a business. I have been very lucky to have a boss/ owner who has taught me what is needed to order, maintain business, social and new relationships. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people who always have something I could walk away with. Whether is was something I needed to know and would use or simply a statement that would put a smile on my face!"
good,"-Constant re-assurance of safety."
good,This company has been a awesome company to work for and I highly recommend Ryder! They are very willing to train there people and show them what they expect.
good,"The best career to date I have ever had. Friendly and hard-working. Even working at several different locations in NJ, PA, and DE, the work ethic never changed."
good,Ryder Transportation Services is a great place to learn and grow from. You can know nothing about the business and yet they will teach you. Ryder is continuously training you to the most current and modern day vehicle technology. You can pursue many different avenues at Ryder. My best advice for anyone looking to go to work there is enjoy it and learn and always give 100% the customers and employer deserve it.
good,nice place to work hands on. failr to employees. i learned alot of hands on skills from changing a tire to changing a starter. also was showed how important safty can be to a come both at work and are daily lifes.
good,"The people I have met and worked with at Ryder are some of the brightest, knowledgeable and skilled people.  But they also know how to have fun.  They are the best part of my job.  The next best part is the challenges I'm presented with . . . I can go as far as I want."
good,This has been one of the best companies to work for. Ryder has great people and great customers. The culture is informal and the work is hard but rewarding. I highly recommend exploring career opportunities in this industry as well as with this company.
good,The work day started at five in the morning. From there we would work on a line for eight hours. Either assembling items or working on machinery the work was rather easy. During the holiday season we we were offered a lot of overtime which was awesome. It was a cool place to work
good,but the only problem is when moving up  in the ranks you should start in an other location as management rather than where you where working with guys for a period of time
good,"This was a third party logistics company contracted by Eastman Kodak to manage there Distribution operations, nothing really changed I happy working there."
good,"A wonderful Place to work"
good,"My typical day was managing operation by checking in with my supervisors and their concerns and need.  Then focus on implementation or adjustments of new routes and or procedures.  I learned to follow process and generate procedures for upcoming operations as well as teaching my employees the importance of following them.  The hardest par of the job was the fast pace, but I still managed to keep a relaxed work place and keep all my employees and customer happy.  In my 13 years with the company there was not a dull moment and all my 13 year were enjoyable."
good,"I began assisting with data entry in the Fuel Reimbursement department, entering claims for fuel charged by dealers to Ryder. This was done in Excel."
good,My role is booking transport on different systems. I have learnt alot of new skills being in this role as i have been there for 4 years. I enjoy working with the people in the office and speaking to the customers.
good,"good work life balance,good pay, happy work environment.Nice co workers"
good,amazing place to work. have good benefits and good salary. great management team. employee are friendly and helpful.
good,Ryder Truck Rental was where I learned and gained insight on Business Management.  This was a fast paced working environment and kept me very busy which was good.  I recommend this management trainee program to recent college graduates.
good,"great place to get started in a big company, they help you grow and allow guidance when it is needed"
good,"typical day is 12 to 14 hours , learned to be safer driver, management fair, coworkers .good groupe of people .quite a few like family. hardest part of job is being leased to company and not being able to change problems.  most enjoyable was being driver trainer"
good,"Offer a variety of teams that explore different aspects of the operation, allowing all associates the opportunity gain deeper knowledge and grow within the company."
good,"Great management team, well organized and interactive with employees. "
good,"I would assist the customers with their orders and pick, pack & ship their products to them, also learn that as working with customers yu need to always be kind and respectful because sometimes working with customers can be very hard, and i enjpyed when the customer's would call me and and thanking me for their order and they recieve it on time"
good,Everybody was nice and respectful. Our work was always done on time and we worked as a team when needed.
good,I learned to be flexible in many departments as well as multi-task during difficult situations. A typical work day is normally difficult due to high demands of car parts but for the most part it makes the day go by faster.
good,Loved having meetings with GM and learning new things. Liked counting parts for GM
good,It been a wonderful experience and unique experience that i learned from this company.Any single detail is not left over from the daily meeting with associates and the management.
good,Inspected trucks and helped in the shop. Enjoyed working with co workers
good,Excellent company. Recruiting technicians at Ryder is very challenging and thus rewarding.
good,"assisted project manager in collecting, documenting and maintaining progress of projects. maintain issues log as well. effective management."
good,Loved the aspect of being on the road and being my own boss. Minimal supervision. Pay could be better. Average benefits.
good,A typical day involved supervising employees in the shipping and receiving of goods.
good,Due to the high demand for CDL A drivers they had very competitive pay one of the best paying companies in the region. The work is very fast paced and can get over whelming especially with the hours you are working.
good,Sometimes we need people to work many employees call off because of the weather was no fare and was dangerous to drive and many time the highway was slicy
good,Good company to work for in the logistics field. The company offers great compensation. I would recommend Ryder to anyone looking to advance their career.
good,"Fast paced construction firm. Gained experience in Construction Management, General Contracting and Consulting Services. Projects included new construction, restoration of landmark buildings, corporate headquarters, retail installations, showrooms, theaters, educational institutions and luxury residential development."
good,"indeed I don;t want to do this."
good,"If you enjoy the same boring things day end and day out and don't mind a guy that has 30 to 40 years seniority doing all the fun work then this assembly line culture is for you! You'll have a steady income, job security and boredom day in and day out! I really enjoyed working for Ryder. It was an easy job, very relaxed workplace, decent shop with a very find preventative maintenance program. Although some work methods aren't manufacture specific the job still gets done ""good-nuff"""
good,Loved the company and my team. Loved to go everyday to work and enjoyed all the corporate luncheon and gatherings. Great appreciation for all the employees.
good,"very good place to work for many years and it was very fun place to work and I felt appreciated and valued employee for the most of the years that I have worked there, but the Hourly wages have been stagnate for almost 4 years with no improvement in the for seeable future, and with new Mgr. and the lack of positive motivation, I personally feel that I have achieved about all that I am able to."
good,"Good Co to work for stable work enviroment."
good,"Great place to work, never had to worry about my check being wrong/short for the 1st time in 10 years of driving a semi."
good,I worked loading skids at first until they needed a forklift operator. I started receiving skids and locating them in there designated spots. I learned to quickly organize the shipments quickly.
good,Company operations manager told me when I started this was not a family mans job if you have a family dont work here i often worked night can't make it to appointments I'll have been seen since 2018 when my face was shattered can't miss work for appointments i can't work third shift operations manager is shaun
good,I enjoyed working for Ryder I had never driven a stand up clamp Pryor to work for Ryder so the experience was wonderful I would work there again it is good company (relocated)
good,"Local run, contract was taken from Ryder. so they had no choice but let me go. They offered me other positions in other areas. But wasn't worth driving to. Was out of my area!"
good,It was ok and i thought that the job can help you with expanding your dreams and advances into te company..its fast pace and it is a great job for u to be
good,I honestly absolutley loved my time at Ryder. My hard work paid off and I became a Team Lead showing my hard work paid off. Resigned due to stress. There is a good chance that I may apply for them again in the future. There's a lot of good people that work for Ryder. The only downside is that some of the General Motors employees treat the Ryder employees as if we were sub human creatures. Union is weak on the Ryder side but I would do it again in a heart beat.
good,"The company needs to get better supervisors, the manager was a good person, It's a good place to work but one supervisor created a hostile work environment.  The company provides on going OEM training. I enjoyed working there, became a tech in charge and a tech on call, got a lot of Cummins engine diagnostic training, Freightliner sam cab training"
good,Not a bad place to work just remember what they sale is customer service so it feels like you have more than one boss to answer to. I guess overall it's a good company to work for.
good,Great Job great management good coworkers the only thing is the lack of hours and since is a part time job there are no benefits until a full time opens up
good,There is plenty of work and various roles. It is like no other account and you have to be willing to put in the hours to learn the job. It is a lot of information all at once. But if you stick with it you will do well.
good,"As a Ryder employee, I was only a contractor.  Very fast pace, forklift warehouse.  High demands with no room for advancement.  I did learn how to use the standing forklift."
good,"I really don't have to many words, I was unfairly terminated after I went all the way to Columbus Ohio .Ryder picked the words of a temporary employee over mines"
good,"Great company but pay is on the lower end, I would work here again if given the chance.  A lot of great people trying to continue growth.  I would recommend this company to someone else."
good,"It was my responsibility to help customers in all aspects from sales, special orders and phones to maintaining records. I was also in charge of inventory ordering and stocking. I was the bookkeeper that maintained all accounts, payroll and taxes. Management came in daily for reports and to address any problems. The hardest part of the job was making all customers happy, which is sometimes impossible. I loved the challenge of multi tasking and making sure that everyone was taken care of. Shortly after taking a maternity leave the owner chose to sell out."
good,"A fun workplace with supportive supervisors and fellow employees, Was not all about the numbers, as long as you kept busy and did what you were expected to. Furthered my experience on the forklift and warehouse environment."
good,"Great comraderie amongst fellow drivers, constant change in rules and regulations, recurring monthly training"
good,My work days were very up beat and energetic. I loved my work environment as well as my co-workers. Management was always helpful. The hardest thing was being behind and having to go into over drive shipping various car parts.
good,"I think Ryder is great company work for ,because ur not just a number with them more of family inviornment .Thay have great benefits retirement plans ,just a all around company ,if I had appitunity I would definity work for them again."
good,Great company to work for. Great work life balance. Work at a client and a fun place to work with great cohesiveness between the teams.
good,"I Loved my job at Ryder, it was fast-pace. Friendly co-workers"
good,Productive and fun fun workplace. Great Company. Work hours were flexible. The company was like family.
good,Simply the best group of individuals to have worked with. I had the opportunity to devour many new skills and manage new roles at any given moment.
good,"I worked on small-duty and medium-duty box trucks, heavy-duty tractor trailer trucks, and Sprinter vans. Just basic preventative maintenance on the vehicles while making sure they were DOT regulated."
good,after for working for ryder for over 4 years  i was contracted out to FLORIDA LIGHT AND POWER. i was  notified wednesday that fpl no longer needed me  was never told the reason why. was never warned or written up . 3 strikes your out in the company policy handbook . i feel this is unfair  working practices.  the company will tell you to work as a team a lot of double talk     used car salesman tactics if your a veteran driver that.s been around you will know what i mean you should see this within less than two weeks overall if you.r in between jobs need some money and have a high tolerance you may last a few years in other words if you can steer away
good,I loved this job until they started hiring just anybody for lead and supervisor positions. It made the work atmosphere uncomfortable to work in and stressful safety conditions. Overall not a bad company.
good,"For a new company, it is overall a great company to work for. There is room for advancement in different areas . What makes or breaks this company is the HR. She makes her own policies and when confronted about it, she retaliates through subtle ways. Uncompassionate and does not meet the defin human resources . As far as work balance, there is opportunity for overtime but somerimes you are mandated ."
good,I am just unhappy with the management at the shop I work at.  I enjoy the type of work I do but have to much on me doing multiple full time jobs in a day and only get paid for the Customer Service position I was hired to do.
good,"typical day everybody done their job in and out and I liked that, poeple pretty responsible doing their job, team players, no discrimination, nor prejudice."
good,Nice environment to work in. Good high energy people to work with.  Great Vacation packages and flexible retirement plans..  Insurance was excellent.  Great low rates
good,"I really enjoy working with Ryder, and I absolutely like it. They really have good benefits, and they really care about the employees. really recommended for everyone."
good,I enjoyed working for Ryder.The hours were flexible but but I needed something closer to home.if things ever changed and I lived closer I would most certainly come back.
good,Ryder works hard to provide a safe and healthy work environment. Their pay is competitive to the account and management fair. Hours can range from 40 to 60 hours a week depending on which account you work.
good,"What I learned at Ryder is to spend time wisely, be an outside the box thinker and be accurate. Everyday we had an assignment to finish or we had to reach a certain amount of number to be able to even be on the computer to process and you had to be accurate and fast paced."
good,"My only experience is as a truck driver."
good,The day consisted of receiving your assignment which equaled 100% for the day. Whether it was unloading trucks and stocking pallets in the warehouse or picking outbound material and loading trucks.
good,Not a bad place to work. Most of what we do is very easy and not long distance. Most of the work is drop and hook and it's all no touch freight. Dispatchers are pretty good and willing to work with you when something comes up. They know you have families and lives. That's rare. Benefits are decent. I've enjoyed my time here and would stay if I weren't moving south.
good,100s of us got laid off from are logistics job and Ryder didn't come in and offer us any thing else within the company. I think a big company like Ryder could of at least done that.
good,"We work hard and my role is very varied and I need to be good at multi tasking and juggling priorities.  We also know how to have some fun too and I help organise team meals, events etc.  I think the most enjoyable part of my job is is the trust and loyalty I have with my current boss.  We know how each other works and we work well together.  I also enjoy the banter that we have in the office and the good friends I have made."
good,"i had a very good supervisor, he helped me a lot. i just came here in the u.s few months and i barely know anything on this country. i am so glad i met him. the work is good but the benefits, there are more better companies that has better benefits. still this was my first job and i had all those experience and it help me. picking/packing was my job here which is the hardest part is lifting heavy materials."
good,The company as a whole is a very good company. They emphasize alot on safety.
good,"Not a bad company to work for but not many local opportunities for advancement."
good,"My division did not do alot of promoting of minority employees, but the Company did. "
good,Great Place to Work. Manager extremely propfessional. I learned a lot about lopgistics
good,"Managed a personnel of about 25 employees, we received all replenishments every morning, put all materials away, then started pulling orders, after started shipping what was pulled. Management for Ryder & Bellsouth was great people to work for, I learned how to manage and supervise a large crew at the largest warehouse Bellsouth had in South Florida and one of the hardest part of my job was having to deal with different personalities of every employees and how to handle each and everyone of them, I did enjoyed working for Ryder Intergrated Logistics and Bellsouth, it was a great pay and alot of overtime."
good,"A typical day at work is doing my deliveries and satisfying my customers, I have learned that along with customer satisfaction timing is also very important."
good,"As soon as I arrived at work,do yard check,inventory of trucks,makes sure all trucks were ready for rental,call customers to comfirm rentals,do rental agreements,and billing,lots of phone work.I learned to do ten things at once!Worked very close with Service Management and Mechanics in shop.Calling customers constantly over and over for rental business.The best part of my job was being so busy and working with so many differant types of people."
good,Strong culture where honesty and integrity- along with commitment are valued. This was my second time at the company and I’m glad I had the opportunity to go back
good,stayed busy all the time was on the go to keep the line running and not shut it down. The people and manager there are good people to work for for the most part just getting tired of the factory work.
good,"It is a great company to work for.  One has to be willing to work some overtime, be able to work with others and a desire to grow with company.  It can be stressful at times but I think it was worth it.  The pay is good and the benefits are good as well."
good,"Although is a great company to work for, with great benefits and a  career to retire from, the work place itself has became unprofessional and poor when it comes to management and culture within technicians. Other than is an ok place to retire from, career advancement will take long, and you will not learn anything more but just on the go maintenance, you will not become a true mechanic at this place just a on the go fleet technician."
good,Hay buen ambiente laboral pero el salario es muy bajo
good,"I was responsible for credit and collections until Ryder had a corporate change and moved this and many other clerical functions to one place in Atlanta, Georgia.  At that time I was unable to relocate and was ultimately affected by a reduction in force.  The people at the district office in Kansas City, Missouri, were awesome!  We worked together and treated each other as family (including family arguments from time to time).  This was many years ago, but for the time period, I was making very good money and was saddened to have to leave the company."
good,"good place to work"
good,"If your looking for a company that will put you in the competitive spirit, look no further. Each BU operates on it's own and you team it what really makes this a great on the job learning experience. If you want to start out in sales, get your feet wet here and the training is great."
good,Started in Devizes and have worked my way up into management. There is a lot of support and mentoring available but you need to ask and then you get it and the support is amazing. The company lets you think for yourself without forever falling back to a process which allows individuals to shine in key areas of strength which the company then uses. Nothing happens quickly at Ryder but when it does happen it is right and the senior management understand the market in depth giving rise to a strong company that only wants to get better in all areas. Really varied and interesting company full of innovations and people striving to be the best in their area of expertise.
good,"I would get there at 5:30, we start work at 6:00 am. then morning stretches then work lunch and 11:00 am to 11:30. then back to work and we end the day at 2:30 pm. I learned how to put order in the computer and print out labels for the product to be ready for shipment. nobody liked management cause they work more hours then they got paid. It was a mixed culture. The hardest part was staying busy when it was slow, or ran out of material. what i enjoyed the most was learning how to drive every forklift in the building."
good,Like working at Ryder they moved the company  to hickory  was to far to drive at the time but it was a very good place to work I enjoyed  working there enjoyed the people I work with layer back place to work but we worked hard
good,"Its a safe place to work, no play free zone. This location is not a hard place to work all task are simple and easy to complete....................................."
good,Great place to work. Location made my commute to difficult after a while and life/work balance did not really exist anymore. The management was active in your personal advancement.
good,Ryder is an excellent place to work. The management and co employees are a big help. The training is not all that extensive but the other employees are eager to help.
good,"I had an excellent boss, who was planning on turning over his role to me as he was retiring.  He actually told me that in all of his years, I was the only person he told that he was sad to have to let go.  The location that we served lost a major customer which provided 60% of the business, so they closed that office."
good,"My division was transferred to a new manager when Ryder bought out the company. The manager did a terrible, possibly fraudulent job. The next manager was extremely inept, making work all the more difficult for the department managers. It all led to the division being downsized during the recession. My co-workers were amazing. We still keep in touch. The benefits included cell phone carrier discounts, credit union, and emergency funds for employees facing a disaster."
good,My knowledge was enhanced by learning a completely different industry that i have never known existed. I loved working there knowing everyday was going to be something different yet reoccurring duties. My team was very generous and trust worthy. There were employee acknowledgment days where the company would host events and festivities for all the associates hard work.
good,"Great place to work and great people to work with.  Over all duties were similar to Avis/Budget.  I trained technicians, managed costs, created safe work environment for all employees."
good,"fuel and or wash lease and rental vehicles, record driver and truck information, gotta be tough in this position all employees think they get to tell you what your job is."

I got paid for absolutely everything by mile or hourly, even for things like traffic delay or cleaning out my assigned truck, what is unheard in this business. Sometimes took a fight to reach my goal, but at the end I always got what I wanted. Not everything is perfect, but is better than at other places and I was happy with them 'till the last day of my work."

The employees loved their work and were passionate about the business.

I gained exposure to a lot of things such as business meeting and the gathering and analysis of data.

good,"Learned how to work with customers and how to"
good,"Absolutely loved working for Ryder.  I found the management team to be extremely competent, patient, and they enforced a strict work life balance.  The downside is that the customer is king, and if you work on an account for an incompetent customer who's only trying to ride out their job until retirement, then those are the cards you've been dealt.  You can either accept that or move on.  Again, that's not Ryder's fault, it's the nature of the business.

good,"Ryder provides the opportunity for long term employment, development, growth within the company.  The benefits are great and the opportunities to learn and advance are available if you apply your time and effort."
good,"While there were a lot of policies to work through, Ryder was always good about training people and giving them the tools they needed to succeed.

good,"I enjoyed coming to work every day. I felt valued and it was also expressed to me, as well as others, that we were valued and appreciated. Constant communication as to what was happening within the company and facility."
good,Very cold environment and fast pace... Everyone has  powered equipment licenses . They do train you on the job. Two weeks of classroom training and one week floor training
good,"great busy work and pay, home daily with family and great overtime. keep water with you at all time because where I deliver to is very hot in palm desert."
