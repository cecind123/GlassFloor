rating,review
bad,"CVS is a thankless organization, where you will be used, abused and eventually discarded. You can be the best employee and management could care less, you’re expendable, and management is worried about their own security."
bad,"If the pharmacy is understaffed, this is the worst job to be in. Honestly, even if its fully staffed, its not great. Management doesnt care about their employees, only themselves and their paychecks. One small mistake and you're basically out the door. The stress has made employees have to enter therapy and fill their own prescriptions for anxiety medications. Do not apply, its not worth it"
bad,Being a cashier at cvs is nothing new. You're expected to do the same thing everyday and pretty much stay at the cashier register and wait on customers. Flexibility is the best part about this company if you don't have hours at your store you can pick up hours in any other stores that need the help. Most of all never make a mistake working for this company they will fire you on the spot.
bad,"CVS consistently cuts hours available to staff so that work tasks that need to be completed do not get done.  Very stressful, unrealistic expectations and lack of support are common.  I worked this job for a long time until the stress and lack of concern for employees and patients' well-being caused me to quit.  Corporate is more concerned with enrollment in programs and bonuses than quality of patient care."
bad,"Shift supervisor is pretty much assistant manager without the pay or benefits. Open/close store with very low pay. East side people steal all the time, pharmacy crew runs on low staff numbers making it a nightmare.  CVS overall is a joke to work at. Don’t care about employees. Save your self and never work here.  Bumbling joke"
bad,"Bullying, harassment, unstable work environment. Management/supervision is horrendous. They belittle everyone and scream and curse at people who make any kind of mistake. They say 8 hours with occasional overtime, but look forward to 10+ a day almost always. Sexist people get away with everything and so do supervisors who curse at employees. And if you work hard you even get to do other people's jobs and not get paid for it! DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,I hate working there! they treat their workers like slaves and does not respect nor appreciate them and they mandate overtime where you have to stay or you will be written up and eventually fired. and they deny your paid time off requests when you want to take time off in the middle of the year and they force you to use it at the end of the year when they see fit
bad,Totally ghetto work environment.  Sacramento office can’t seem to get their patient schedule right.  Last minute patients are added to your calendar.  Always a mass exodus of employees ranging from pharmacist to nursing.  Management have no clue what the work entails.  Expects everyone else to do all the work for them.  No team support.
bad,"Quite possibly the worst company I have worked for. Despite emphasizing patient care in training, it is quite clear that the bottom line is profits. If you want to get ahead in this company, kiss as much corporate a** as possible, and emphasize speed over patient care."
bad,"Don't even bother applying, it was a drama filled environment from the start and the manager has no leadership, conflict resolution, training or proper communication skills what so ever. If there was a different manager, I imagine it'd be a great place to work, however as long as the current manager is there, it will continue to be terrible."
bad,"Im a former employee of cvs specialty on renner rd. Management is unprofessional , they are discriminatory, the supervisors bully you if you are smater than them. My supervisor had a bad rapport as being the whire of the compy.Training is not long enough and then they theiw you ion the floor to the other reps to help you .The lead are childish and do mire than the supervisors .They are very strict on attendance abd and they rill your tardies and absences together when in thier policy they are separate. No advancement but to another team. No bonuses, they they treat blacks differently."
bad,There is one amazing store the one on old US-231 in Lafayette IN most amazing store manager there never could ask for better boss. But the other bosses and upper bosses and their advice and ethics don't care about their own policy at all. They don't care how their employees are talked to or how they talk to them.
bad,"Cvs company is a joke, and don't appreciate their employees. they don't pay well at all, and I hate them. management sucks, and is horrible needs a new DL."
bad,"Overall a bad company, you have lack of management. You can’t call out if your sick with out getting an Occurrence at least for my team. It’s a very unhealthy work environment and over worked with very bad  pay. Cvs can afford to pay their employees more but they rather promote their upper leadership than others."
bad,"OMG in 20 years in healthcare I have worked for some sh** companies, but this one takes the cake. Have worked here almost a year, and I'm GTFO'g after the holidays. They FAILED their state compliance audit 6 months ago and the state took their medicaid patients away (40% of their business). They went from forcing nurses to work 90 hours PER WEEK to ""no overtime will be allowed EVER, PERMANENTLY"" in the last 2 months. They don't pay enough to NOT get overtime (RNs make less than $40/hr) and have suddenly decided (this week) that if you are even close to going over 40 hours, the schedulers will simply, arbitrarily, REMOVE YOUR APPOINTMENTS AND GIVE THEM TO SOMEONE ELSE. I'm sorry, but first you tell me I am responsible for every appointment on my board (because they're my patients, I'm the ""case manager"") to ""oh but wait, we might have to pay you money if you see them?"". In the last 2 months, 5 out of 8 pharmacists and 4 out of 7 upper managers have either outright found new employment or suddenly (ie within 1 day) mysteriously gone on ""LOA""s ... obviously they know something the rest of us don't. Move along, nothing to see here!!!"
bad,Do not work here ever! Is not worth the money for how they treat people. They disrespected and are racist as a company. They do not try to help there employees.
bad,Do not do it. Training is a joke and you are worked way more than your worth as a manager. The stores are filthy in the back. Everything is old and smells. I would never buy from there ever again.
bad,You work to hard for the little pay. Only two technicians doing four workstations. Never enough workers. You work like a slave. You are just a number at the company. Plus they are closing stores.
bad,Was mistreated and brought down even by my own manager and basically used and abused his coworkers in all ways possible. Had favoritism towards some coworkers and treated them in ways that they get whatever they wanted while he brought everyone else down in the process. Even my district manager which I wish she stayed. Saw the potential in me and gave me a raise when I was getting promoted. She was amazing and treated me greatly and heard me out. I wasnt different in her eyes but with the lower managers of stores. I have not had good experience and was never listened to or cared about. I was one of the hardest workers as I am told by my fellow coworkers that weren't privileged  in the sense of favorable outcomes by my manager. It was really rough and it really brought me down to the point where I couldnt return work of how harsh it was. It was so abusive to me and the expectations of me compared to everyone else was outrageously ridiculous because I had to do the work of about 4 people and not expected to fail. Others wouldnt have to do that much or wouldnt do their work and they get praised but in the process of me always having to pick up the slack and being brought down
bad,employers are not supported by management or given the tools to succeed. Pay is good but definitely not worth the stress of the work environment. Not recommended
bad,Where I was working no employee care for each other and management didn't care about nobody but herself ...................................................
bad,"Unappreciated, underpaid and overworked employees thru out the department. Stop asking workers to do so much for such little pay. Forcing extra work on workers without compensation is heartbreaking."
bad,"I would not recommend this company, therefore no one should work for them. Their management and salary structure is no good. Overall this company is not a good company to work for they do not care about their resource"
bad,Upper management does not take care of lower level management. They just increase the amount of work that needs to be done with less hours.  They will hire new employees for the same job and pay more than employees who have been there years longer.
bad,"unfair & demanding company . routinely under schedule employees & expect the very few to complete tasks that require way more people . constantly doing things out your job description & expected to stay way after your scheduled time. Management is phony , gossip too much , talk down to you & a lot of favoritism is shown . You will be overwhelmed overworked & miserable ."
bad,"You're not fully trained for what you have to do once you hit the floors. Your told one thing and then you're told to do another, and then yelled at for doing what you were told to do!"
bad,Front store management is treated very poorly by District Manager and above. They don’t care what Managers have t say as long as the Pharmacy is happy they are happy.
bad,"Run! Run ! Run! Cvs is the worst company I've ever worked for!! You will  be extremely overworked and underpaid!!!!!! Emotionally, physically, verbally abuse is what you'll experience every day!!"
bad,"This store has a high turnover and I see why. The store Manager  is horrible . He harasses you on your day off. Nothing is ever good enough , he is not encouraging. He expects so much from a 600$ checkHe doesn’t want to to succeed or move up in the company he wants to keep you in the same position. He is mean and he talks to everyone about your personal issues. He is aggressive .   I would never  recommend this location to anyone to work at while he is still in charge.recommend this cvs to anyone if you value your life or personal space"
bad,"I was very unhappy working for CVS!  Very unfriendly atmosphere, and if you did have a question you was made to feel stupid!  Managment did not like to accomidate you or giveyou a set schedule."
bad,This company does not respect it's employees enough.  They make them work for little pay.  It might be best to try another PBM or retail company to work for.
bad,"Dont waste your time, a lot of favoritism and personal relationships. No promotions unless you either know someone important, also a-lot of racism No opportunities, company only cares about money thats all their employees are nothing to them!"
bad,"This company is a complete train wreck and will destroy your overall health. No hours, miserable culture, constant stress and just a horrible company to work for."
bad,Corporate does not think about or just doesn't care about what is actually happening on the retail level. They should pay attention to what is happening. They never allow enough hours or employees to operate their company.
bad,They just don't give a rat's! They are cold and distant. Very poor management that will stab you in the back. The BIGGEST LIARS. They make you miserable all day long. Only 5 minutes in the day to use the restroom! Adherence is so restrictive. No exceptions! The good thing is you get a discount downstairs at the cafeteria. That's it! The rest sucks. No fun events. No surprise pizza day. No free coffee or tea.
bad,I was a shift. The district manager was so RUDE. The General manager made me work every single holiday while she had time off. She was a awful boss. They didn’t care about their employees. Horrible place to work
bad,CVS does not care about it’s employees only 2 people are allowed full time status everyone else will get 7-18 hours weekly those hours will be placed randomly throughout the week do not complain or corporate will come and chastise you they  don’t really like for techs to take breaks you will be frisked before leaving you will work 2-3 stations at once and be yelled at if you can’t the pharmacist do not assist techs
bad,"Managers have favorites who can choose their own schedule and work area. Definitely not a fair place to work. Harassment is reported to their best friend, so nothing is done."
bad,"Got messed about, lied too, cheated out of work and money. would not recommend working for this company. i was a manager and seen how they treated member's of staff. More so coming from CEO's , no escaping!"
bad,People act like they're in high school. Upper management talks about one another including sensative info about co-workers. Everyone talks about one another behind their back and upper management don't have no respect for any of their employees. Once again not the company but the people who run the store including district leaders speak to you as if you're a child with no sense.
bad,"Little - no training in pharmacy."
bad,I was a technician for 5 years. Horrible! The company does not care about there employees. Pay and hours suck. They over work you because they refuse to hire help and drastically cut hours. There is no structure. No one is ever on the same page. Work there at your own risk and don’t say you weren’t warned. CVS sucked my happiness for retail away.
bad,"Not the greatest place to work at in all honesty. The system is designed to keep employees on their toes in fear of termination. Unrealistic goals, and unfair policy."
bad,CVS pharmacy really does not care about their employees. They tell you you can move up in the company but truly you really do not. You can’t even have a decent conversation with a District manager. They do not like giving extra hours nor increase in pay.
bad,"CVS has become very shady over the last 2 years as a company, personally I’ve been dealing with a problem of not being paid correctly for an 19 months. Management doesn’t seem to care anytime I bring it up. Customers are constantly complaining about the awful system cvs has. We don’t get paid enough and they’re constantly cutting hours."
bad,"Managers at my district didn't appreciate the extra work and never encourage that you are doing a good job. "
bad,"Keep in mind this was 9 years ago for me. This was by far the absolute worst job and company I have ever worked for. Trained, told we would change stations every 2 hrs. That was a joke. I rarely was allowed anywhere but drive-thru. During employment I became pregnant. No stool allowed to rest the feet a min, rarely got proper breaks, ...still stuck in drive-thru, no support with management whatsoever. Was working 40 hours from day one. After the 1st yr I questioned why I wasn't receiving holiday pay and benefits. Was told i was a part time employee because they were only allowed so many full time positions."
bad,"This place is a total disaster and a filthy place to work. NO one wants to do any work, no work ethics, and excuses every time. NO one cleans the bathrooms, they are disgusting filth. The store is in shambles and filthy dirty. Rude employee's who make up excuse not to do their work. Management don't care, nothing gets done. There has been over 15 employees leave this place and 3 managers."
bad,Managment sucks.  They will work you in the ground and give you no hours to run the store. They hound you to death and use intimidation to keep you in line.  Hated working for this company.
bad,Initially I started working with purpose. I was happy and worked hard. when my review came around I received the same one as everybody else even though I was doing manager work within 3 weeks of starting. There are constant new hires who don't know what they are doing. since they are receiving less per hour in pay they get more hours than myself who has been there almost a year and knows the work. For a part time position I get about 13 hrs a week with no benefits. That is not a live-able wage. For a fortune 5 company I expected more. So sure you'll like it at first but then you get steamrolled like everyone else. Go somewhere else for work.
bad,"I worked at the distribution center in Chemung, NY and it sucked. Nobody cares about team work and the management there does not seem to care about any of the employees or about the growth of the employees. You never know how long you work ever, every day is different. If you have small children this job is not a good fit for you..."
bad,"If I could rate it as less than '1', I would. I work full-time hours, yet am still only considered part-time status as a pharmacy technician. My colleagues work less hours, yet are provided full-time status. You are expected to train all over the state in which you reside to get your license. After you get your license, you are still expected to do an array of modules every week on your own time. Management refuses to supply me with full-time status, despite having greater education than even the store manager. Management does not return emails. I was hired as a pharmacy tech then offered an additional job, in which I was later informed that I would not be paid, as corporate didn't authorize a pay raise. I had been working in this position for a month, yet received no pay. At most CVS stores, pharmacy is disgusting and has little regard for cleanliness (ie. miscellaneous pills lying on the ground - if fall on the ground, they are put back in bottles, rodents, dust clumps, etc.). High staff turnover and people are too scared to complain, as such behavior often results in termination."
bad,"I literally killed my self working for this company. I sacrificed my personal life and spending quality family time with my children and Wife for this company. My career seemed to have been on the right path until new racist District Manager arrived. Once he arrived he began firing managers. What made things worse is that this Dm was so unprofessional. He was always yelling, cursing and making managers cry  Dm fired people in order to bring his people in"
bad,"Very Disorganized."
bad,This company doesn’t care about the employees. They only care about sales and the costumer is always right.  They just want the costumer to give good reviews they don’t care if the costumer yell at you. Only put 1 employee to run RX alone and give you stress and pressure.  Rx always messed up.  Work holidays.
bad,"Do not work here.  No one knows what is going on.  They hire you-eventually.  Then no one knows what is going on. There is zero support.  You are on your own as far as orientation.  Your phone and ipad will not work and if they do it will not be for long.  Then all the supervisors quit. then all the management goes on LOA.  You MUST work 6 days of over time a month after you give them 40+ hrs a week.  BUT DO NOT GET OVERTIME! No communication, no one to back you up.  Go to a house to infuse a patient only to find there are no supplies.  Expect very far drives in an area you are not remotely living near. I cannot even make this stuff up!!!"
bad,The was micro management and the coworkers were very Clicky they would gang up on you if you are different. A lot of immature pharmacists and pharmacy techs.
bad,Employees are treated with no respect.Higher leaders they come for visits and they dont bother meeting cashiers or anyother employees in the shift.The managers gossip all day for others and most of them interfere at work
bad,"The CVS i worked for had it's ups and downs. WHen management changed, thats when it became dreadful to go to work. Hardly any breaks and the union did not stand up and fight for you!"
bad,"Everyone gossips even the managers, it’s like working at a high school. People get into relationships, flirting with each other even with customers. No hours and the only pay that’s good is working in the pharmacy. Customers always give you an attitude because their prescriptions are never ready when they’re supposed to be. I would never recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,"Salary: horrible (minimum wage) and impossible to support a single occupant or family."
bad,Company is in health insurance pay is so low workers can not afford to get health insurance for themselves.  Company did not pay for shift difference.
bad,The training in class and on the floor was poor. The hours for a CSR are 6:30am CST to 8pm CST. They dont care if you have young children that you need to be there for.You work on the hours they give you and have no consideration or flexibility to schedule you within the hours of childcare needs.
bad,They will send you all over the warehouse to work if you're good.  They say they care about employees but really care about themselves. Work/Life Balance is horrible. Manager is a bad person no respect for other . He does not know the work.
bad,worst company only cares for their shareholders. they do not care for theirs employees. its all metric driver and technician hours each store are cut 30 to 40 %. every store is understaffed to severe dangerous levels. they do not care for patient safety and have 1 technician and 1 pharmacist filling 300 rx a day with no overlapps.
bad,They don't care about employee and are understaffed by choice. You are required to do the job of entire store without compensation because of not wanting to hire proper amount of staff needed.
bad,Awful hours for management and hard work never gets recognized. Company does not value their employees at all. They put too much pressure on all staff and management for goals that are not possible.
bad,No opportunity for advancement. No one works a full 40 hours. There is no rotation so all employees do not know how to do all the jobs in the pharmacy.
bad,They make everything sound great until you start working then they flip everything and the feeling you get is that they want you out. They spy on everything you do and say and only give you 7 minutes a day to use the rest room.  My supervisor was good but she is one of the few good ones there.
bad,"I worked there through the birth of 2 of my children and a miscarriage. I was denied paid leave for both pregnancies because I didn't have cvs insurance and was a part of a union. I wasnt given bereavement for my miscarriage and had to use my vacation time to grieve. I barely made over minimum wage as a pharmacy technician working fulltime. Employees were written up for taking more than 1 sick day at a time, even with a doctors note."
bad,cvs health distribution is a very unfair and micromanaged work enviroment and people are fired for voicing their opinions and someone needs to look into the ways minorities are treated by management
bad,I got introduced to CVS through vocational rehabilitation that works under ADA. When I got hired from the bgining I was treated so poorly that it affected me to my work perfermnce.
bad,Not giving hours!! Put on call for a department that they said who needed me but now not enough work!!  To me they really dont care about the worker and they skills!! Put u where they need help totally out your work zone!!
bad,"Too stressful. Phone calls are pushed to your phone and you do not get time to enter notes into a customer’s file before you take the next call. Way too many documents to search for the right information. Breaks are mostly used for running to the bathroom. You get dehydrated fast because you do not get time to drink water, tea, coffee or whatever in between calls. Supervisors you contact for assistance are rude and not very helpful"
bad,Horrible store management wasnt trained properly didnt feel like A family there. Everyone talks behind store managers back about what she is not doing but I feel they should say something. I found something better and before I left I voiced my some of my issues with her.
bad,"This was the worst company I've ever worked for they do not care about their employees or their customers all they care about is getting sales any cost. All the management from store manager on up to corporate management (Regional and District especially the ceo )are all terrible and worthless, if you get a chance to work for this company turn around and run any place ...digging ditches would be better than working here at CVS"
bad,"In the being of my employment @ Cvs I loved it, I was hired as a Shift Supervisor the manager who hired me was the Best! Hands down! Went to work it felt like a team. There for almost 3 years I knew Everything! At the end I was being harassed by a new manager in training! Made Cvs aware they didn't care/don't care! I tried so hard to transfer out but a store has to have the horses to pull you in. So I felt stuck. ."
bad,Wasted 5 years of my life for a CEO that pays himself billions and keeps skeleton crews through out the company expecting them too work Holidays weekends open to close and overnight shifts to get the job at what ever cost to the employees including putting them at risk to dangerous situations all the time with criminals stealing from them drug addicted people always in your company.
bad,They don't teach you anything. They expect you to know everything automatically.  If you are not pretty or white you get mistreated.  If you do something the credit goes to someone else.
bad,CVS Pharmacy is a business-driven company. They will work you to the point where you spend your days off of work at work just to meet ends meet. The expectations for pharmacists are way too high.
bad,The Chandler location is absolutely terrible & will have you running for the front doors when you find out all of their secrets & lies!! They give you NO help to do your job once you're on the floor & they don't care about anything besides their own lives!!
bad,"Very poor place to work! Management is only interested in generating as much profit as possible. Low wages, low employee morale. High employee turnover. Stay away!"
bad,Two face company talk behind your back. Lie to you. Always Always past the blame District Manager has there picks. Customer can call and lie and cvs will believe it
bad,"If you are looking for a job that gives you none of the tools required for success, treats the employees like garbage, and is border-line slavery then CVS is the job for you!  Middle and upper management don't understand the everyday running of the store, nor do they care.  There is no appreciation for the employees, and if you are in management, don't expect any work-life balance at all;  you belong to them!"
bad,"Bad place to work. Low pay. Poor training and nobody helps when you ask for assistance. Nobody can answer any of my questions. Poor hours, make you work the weekends and cannot change your schedule. One day my manager told me to clock out early because I was not going back to my desk later and she said she would fix my hours. Instead, they took away my PTO while I was still working!! Have never felt valued or respected."
bad,"This seemed like a good place to work until I was judged harshly for  the diversity within my family unit. Once the leaders were aware of my family's culture I was not treated fairly. Leaders were lazy, unmotivated, and clueless, constantly shopping online, but demanded non stop hard work and perfection from the teams. Promotion is based on cliques, and skin colors. I used to get an upset stomach when walking into the job every day and I do not miss that. My doctor said that was the most stressful job that I have worked based on my numbers and my body deterioration while having worked there for many years. Its funny how the people that are supposed to be ""leading"" are always asking us nobodys for assistance answering questions that they never know the answers to. Someone please re-staff the 2nd floor!"
bad,I do not enjoy working for this company. I feel very under appreciated and overworked. Pay is not that great and never given enough hours to actually have enough techs on.
bad,"You’ll be working full time hours with part time benefits. Which means you don’t earn sick time or vacation time. You get paid next to nothing. Trying to change your schedule is next to impossible because seniority will overrule you and have you working whatever is left over. Trying to get someone to cover your shift because you can’t work is next to impossible but again people with seniority do it all the time. They don’t care about you or your personal life, regardless if it has to do with work. I would not recommend working here. Everyone hates their job and everyone quits."
bad,Worse place that I ever work in my entire life management is terrible treatment is horrible management don’t care about their employees they want you to work until you pass out very poor leadership communication is very very bad management put a lot of pressure and stress on their employees
bad,Terrible place of employment. Management does not care about paying for experienced workers and there is no room for advancement. Good luck enjoying what you do. A lot of people leave for other jobs.
bad,"The PIC now is much better by 1000% than the PIC when I was there.  Unless you liked being cussed out, having things thrown at you, making your life miserable in general hoping you will quit and playing favorites to those that worshipped him.  One of the worst experiences of my life.   "
bad,"I was a Shift Supervisor but it felt more like an overworked stocker. All day is stocking shelves,  price changes, merchandising while giving out change, lunches, counting tills etc.... Your expected to run the store efficiently even if there's only three people with you being one of them.  No advancement or competitive pay rate. Good place to get supervisor/managerial experience."
bad,"The pharmacist is not nice and will lie to make herself look better.  She starts drama between employees and will never admit when she is wrong.  I have worked with many people over the years, and have never met anyone so unhappy as her.  You will leave work crying everyday wondering what you did wrong.  Do not work at CVS in Richmond, MO!"
bad,"They are slave drivers that care only about their production numbers and look at employees as robots. I workes for the distribution center in vero Beach, FL."
bad,Cvs corporate makes their money by exploiting their employees.  It's horrible and they will never pay a full time wage. They're using the fact that the market is flooded with pharmacists to work them basically to death or till they quit.
bad,"If you are applying to work at the CVS Specialty in Orlando, do not waste your time. I have been a pharmacy technician for 2 years and this is by far the worse job I have ever had."
bad,I was very hopeful after my interview with CVS Pharmacy. They explained to me that I would get the training I needed to become licensed as a Pharmacy Technician. Once I started the job I received very little training. They were so under staffed that they seemed annoyed to have to train someone.
bad,"There no loyalty and no sense of direction .No incentives, no growth. Pay rate is low for a person who work for many years in the company.no respect of how hard you work"
bad,They will send you all over the warehouse to work if you're good. Just for $12 an hour which is literally peanuts for what you have to do. They say they care about employees but really care about themselves. Work/Life Balance is horrible.
bad,CVS does not value employees nor customers. It's about profit gains and numbers. They don't care if they overwork their top talented/good hearted employees by understaffing working them to the bone so the company can save money. High turnover rates & toxic company culture. Employees who dedicated many yrs quit due to as truly greener on the other side
bad,Ok place to work depending on the manager . My manager wasn’t very friendly. Very bossy and rude. Find something that fits you. And make sure the boss gives you good vibes if  not keep moving forward with something else. You don’t want to work in an environment where you have to walk on egg shells
bad,"Do not work here, they do. Ot follow their core values and the place is just Ghetto  Its all about who you know not what you know. Rep know more than management."
bad,"Where do I begin? This company, mainly the managers and the HR dept. is THE MOST unfriendly, unprofessional, idiotic and incompetent people I have ever met in my entire life. This company drops the ball big time and them not dotting their I's and crossing their T's cost me time, money, frustration, annoyance and MY JOB. The 2 airheads in the HR department along with the fool of a site manager and clown of a director need to be replace ASAP. The next time they job the ball that jeopardizes someone's livelyhood you need to stop and think about your job and YOUR livelyhood. Pathetic and bumbling idiots."
bad,Never enough help and my old district supervisor was disrespectful and that was the main reason why I left. He told me I better pick up the phone every time he called or else there would be a problem.
bad,"CVS is a horrible company to work for. They push you to the limit with a workload so great that everyone is stressed heavily. The pharmacists have to come in early, stay over each day and not get paid for it.  Pharmacists have to come in on their off days and not get paid for it if they are salaried."
bad,"This management is the worse. My daddy was fighting for his life in the hospital from Nov 2009 to march 2010 in the hospital. I only missed one 4-10 shift the day they did code  blue on him. That September 2010 I was having sleep studies and had to miss 2 days. the meds the dr put me on were too strong and got dizzy and threw up Oct.1, 2010 and missed my shift. Next day I came in I was not on the schedule at all."
bad,"Over works techs, unrealistic corporate metrics, they are cutting hours and increasing work for techs. We should unionize, this is a horrible company."
bad,Eckerd's was a great company that cared about their employees but CVS doesn't. Worked for both but after CVS bought out Eckerd's they changed. No bonuses and only gives what they have to by law. Customers are terrible and worse than any other retail chain. For what their employees have to deal with the pay is laughable!
bad,"horrible pharmacy management, makes working very stressful, already stressful because manager is always on you about something then add the angry customers who cant get their meds yet.  And the pay is horrible esp considering what you have to put up with."
bad,I could say I enjoyed working here some days but overall it was horrible! No training just was thrown to learn on my own! Manager was unfair! Always messing with employees hours to keep them under radar! Security was pointless! Truck days was the worst!
bad,"Would not ever apply back to CVS"
bad,"This job probably would have been better but management was bad and you did a lot of work for little pay, always had to cover shifts and when you needed a shift covered it would be like pulling teeth"
bad,Just totally ghetto. There's nothing more to say about the company. So unprofessional. Micro management which was not necessary. Persons where leaving all the time. No job security.
bad,"Manager was too rude and patients at cvs frustrating, management and hr department are the worst.you just work a little less than a pharmacist but still low salary."
bad,Not a great company to work for. They do.not care about their employees. They treat see employees like nothing while others get away with whatever they feel like.
bad,CVS wants you to have open availability for them to only give you 13 hours per week the pay is horrible management could care less about anything pertaining to your personal life they only care that you produce it’s always short staffed the pharmacists are self centered it’s hard to advance in the company and you literally have to be a verbal punching bag CVS is for college kids not for a working person
bad,"Heavy work load, but good co-workers, company outlook is very strong. The atmosphere is fun and casual, but focused on end-of-year of ramp up project planning from July until December, after that no one could take vacation time unless they approved it, and if it was an emergency or maternity leave."
bad,"Hated it, experienced a lot of racism. Even in the process of moving laterally."
bad,"Pharmacists do not care for there team. Performing slave work for pennies, I would not reccomend this place of buisness to anyone looking for a pharm tech job."
bad,"CVS cut hours so much that they expect one person to run the whole store, ACO are considered cashiers. Employees are expected to clean bathrooms. There is no maintenance crew. There are health hazards all over. No union, benefits are so so. The pay is ok. Customers want personal help, not ACOs. Not sure where CVS is going and what they are planning on in the future. People working there are easy and pleasure to work with, not upper management."
bad,"If you like being extremely stressed, underpaid, treated horribly by a stressed out PIC and belittled and yelled at by customers that have not received meds because your so behind in filling prescriptions then this is the place to work.  There is nothing positive about working for this company. Best decision for my mental health leaving this place.  I used to love going to work. It became dreadful and depressing. Everyones so stressed it became a hostile work environment."
bad,"Due to change of company policy now a day cvs doesn’t care about their employees. "
bad,"Even when i work more than 8 hours they never gave me a break. REALLY bad pay for all the responsabilities. also i was promote to be shift supervisor and they never gave me training for it. expecting for me to know everything."
bad,LIARS! Don't waste your time! Unqualified Supervisors. Manager in paper claims gossips and talks about everyone behind their back and will smile in your face at the same time.
bad,Horrible company!!! They don’t care about their employees. They are more worried about a dollar rather than customer safety. And the moment you give them feed back they don’t like they try to do everything they can to fire you. Stay away if you can!
bad,Awful management. Lack of guidance.  No chance to expand. Discourage self learning.  Very unwelcoming.  No assistance at all. Would never recommend.  Especially Craig Stanwood
bad,"cvs is typical pharmacy, not interesting place to work.everyday it is same routine Training is extra long.modules are very annoying .i would not recommend this place to work"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at the CVS health corp office located in Orlando, Florida. They micro-manage the employees, no room to breath, always have to be on the run to make it to your desk if not you will get reprimanded. That location is all about beat the clock. Except for one manager that works there, the rest of them are useless. They made a huge mistake by giving the whole office a $2 increase but then realized that it was a mistake on their part and took it away. That's the kind of place CVS health is."
bad,"All of your hard work credit will be given to your manager and you will be overworked, stressed and underpaid. The benefits are horrible especially considering CVS owns a medical and pharmacy insurance you still have a high deductible plan. Overall I would not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"Very strange office vibe. Disjointed very disconnected which started with the female manager and her second another female. Never fixed issues with devices that the heads did not personally use. Yet expected normal work flow. Constant gossiping and unbelievable cliquish behavior, just disgusting."
bad,"Recruiter was rude, racist and had an abrupt tone. He also tried to low-ball me on Salary; I suspect this was because I'm a woman."
bad,"no lunch breaks for pharmacy staff, cashiers are treated poorly and overworked management lacks on all counts there is no room for growth because no one teaches as they should"
bad,"My experience was awful, I worked at cvs for 2 years, manager told me She was going to helped for pharmacist tech position  and she never did, I feel that I lost my time..."
bad,"Pros: Meeting great staffs."
bad,"I left because one of my colleagues HAD HEART ATTACK at CVS while working with phones ringing constantly, lines at front and drop-off and people honking from drive through with just ONE pharmacy tech. I left."
bad,"I was at the Harrisonburg VA location. Being the only Africa American in this building, my co-workers weren't kind at all. All of them made it very difficult for me on a daily basis. It's truly sad that we still live in a time when people refuse to accept other people because of color differences."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there. Not a great place to work  only get a raise once a year. Not more than 25 cents. Does not have a good management.
bad,They eant you to do everything cvs and dont care if you drop dead . They just replace you. I dont have nothing else to say about that place. They ruined my customer service experience.  P.T.S.D
bad,"For the amount of work and stress that the pharmacy technicians have to endure while working, we are grossly underpaid and there is almost little to no opportunity for upward movement for a pharmacy technician."
bad,Horrible management and you are a slave to the for a mere basis below average salary. They spect you to do everything un realistic expectations abusive management
bad,"No work life balance, extremely stressful no hours for employees so everything falls on the management staff. They expect managers to pull double almost everyday to get the work done. The company expect so much with the little they provide and they don’t provide any support."
bad,"You get micromanaged ridiculously. New supervisors trying to show their strength are often just awful. You get told off for having keys, wallet, anything on your desk. No phones allowed anywhere near the working area. No talking to other people for more than 30 seconds without being asked to leave by their supervisor. People who have been here for 10 years and have received promotions have not seen more that a $2.00 pay increase. It’s truly miserable."
bad,They do not value as an employee. You hardly move up in this company. This company over works you. Some pharmacist believe they are better because they have a degree and you are just a pharmacy technician.
bad,Management doesn’t care about their workers. The best thing to do as an employee at cvs pharmacy is to gain experience and sharpen your skills and look for a better work environment.
bad,"The work that I was given did not match the work that was described in the job posting/interview. When I made a suggestion towards improving the processes that we were using, my boss criticized me for ""rocking the boat"". Something that really stuck in my mind (and later contributed to my decision to leave) was a quote from one of my former co-workers: ""The work is pretty tedious, but you get used to it after a while."""
bad,They expect you to lie to you distract manager about safty. They cut hours constantly and pretty much only higher for part time. They don't offer any room to grow
bad,"From day one it was made clear I wasn't wanted there despite the store manager assuring me otherwise. I was labeled argumentative by a manager who often talked for others and made me sound out worse than I was. She also targeted the newest manager and almost got her in trouble with the Store Manager by saying she complained about him leaving early all the time and in reality it was the bad manager who complained about him and she did this constantly. Don't work there, they won't care about you and refuse you breaks and leave you alone for almost the entirety of your shift."
bad,This company has a very stiff culture that doesn’t seem to grow with the business needs. Focus more on talent development and utilize more hourly staff vs just managers scheduled daily . Leverage that great talent and keep managers engaged to priorities.
bad,"Medical benefits are expensive per paycheck (starting at  $171 & up) and out of pocket depends on your medical spending. Deductibles of $1500-$6000 w/20% coinsure. HSA $500/Per person annual. Dental,  vision,  prescription benefits are excellent. All available after 90 days.  401k match available after 1 year. 2 weeks vacation time. Salaried @ $47k w/abundant OT highly encouraged."
bad,this company will have 20 things for you to do daily. Big projects on top of sales and customer service. They will provide you with two to three employees to help you on each shift which isn't enough help at all so you will definitely not complete your daily tasks.
bad,"The whole environment sucks from the managers, the overall vibe of the call center, not enough money for all the work and system you have to learn, the phone rings non stop."
bad,This job takes a lot out of a individual. No regular security . Employees expected to stop theft while being short handed to keep store running . Union job so don’t look for raises based off performance. Stores are ran strictly off of hard work from a few employees while customers constantly steal and complain about coupons that they didn’t read. Store manager lacked integrity. In conclusion stay away from cvs you will have no life and not make up for it financially glad this nightmare is over ...
bad,I was pregnant with complications and was not allowed lunch most days nor was I allowed to sit down even with a Dr's note. No overtime and no care for me having a family and working with me on the schedule. None what so ever.
bad,CVS doesn't train you in stuff that matters like the photo lab area. They dont compensate you if you have to go out of town for a mandatory class. They dont really want you to succeed. They'll give you the tools but they wont give you the information. Especially when you're being grandfathered in to the pharmacy. The store I worked at I was the only one to deal with the customers. Everyone else hid in the back while I dealt with customers and their questions and coupons. And I didnt have numbers to override anything so I'd have to call for a manager and wait while they took their sweet time up to get to me. Then they expected me to put up coupons and deal with customers and if I didnt I'd get yelled at.
bad,"Store managers just don't care about you at the job. They do not provide you the tools or the support staff to complete your tasks. They tell you to turn left, then holler at you for turning left"
bad,I started off as a CPhT with this company. The Pharmacist didn’t allow in store training & when I asked he said well you went to school figure it out.
bad,Not good place to work and districts manager horrible and culture they don’t respect managers or what you are going threw my mom was dieing and they abused me
bad,"Constant high turnover rate, poor pay, wack benefits, rough working conditions and as usual like any other workplace favoritism. That's why it's not a long-term, stable career because of mistreating workers."
bad,"Poor management, poor overall work culture, poorly defined expectations, all about the numbers,very limited opportunity for advancement, did not recognize previous management experience."
bad,"Horrible company, poor pay, they basically want you to work your self to death and show zero appreciation. All that matters is the scores that they grade you on, my immediate manager(district leader) (ive gone thru 5 in the past 3 years) only care about your scores and will instruct you to cheat and lie to obtain these scores."
bad,Favoritism galore. Not a good place to work HR didn't care. Management were clueless. Very poor working environment. They promoted unskilled people to be managers to run departments with no experiance or knowledge.
bad,"Fired for using a gift card that was given to me as a gift. Was (wrongfully) terminated for ""Paying for own merchandise which violates code of conduct and policy in the handbook"" (handbook doesn't exist and policies were never available or mentioned) 6 weeks after I was told I did nothing wrong and everything was fine by my manager. Management also files false police reports and asset protection makes surveillance videos (proof in employee's favor) disappear."
bad,"I started working at the CVS in Swansea, Illinois back in May of 2019. At first, the environment seemed pretty nice, the employees were all nice and a bit helpful which I was happy about, I was getting a decent amount of hours and all in all I really enjoy being a pharmacy tech.  However, as the time passed the more I actually got to see the real horror. Our store started to get a remodel which provided us with more space however the entire time that the remodel was going on was a total NIGHTMARE! We were so behind on getting percriptions filled our que was on avarge about 75 pages long. We were working out of totes, which means all of the medciene were just thrown in the tote so we really couldn't tell if we had the medicien or not and it took forever to find it if we did. On top of all of this, they started to cut our hours. We are working with one pharmacist and about three techs, which is good on a slow day but honestly you need at least four. All of the hours are given to the first the pharmacist and then the certified pharmacy techs, which we have about two, already that takes up one hundred and sixty hours which is not much room left for anyone else. I haven't worked in two weeks and when I do work its about one day a week. I am 20 years old and the sole provider for myself and the only thing they can tell me is ""we are going to get more hours soon"". I really thought I found something I could do to help me on a real, new career path but it been nothing but a nightmare. However, I did get the chance to work at another CVS store and it was absolutely amazing! I mean they"
bad,Terrible upper management. The company does not value their employees at all. Pharmacy tech hours keep getting reduced and more tasks being added on. Stress levels are unreal. Working at CVS will slowly destroy your soal.
bad,Very slow and boring hated working here I quit in less then 2 weeks also the manager was terrible and my co workers were even worse the person training me also didn’t show me anything
bad,You don’t even make it the 90 days unless you have a thing with the leads and managers they all are Bullies and very unprofessional they only use people.
bad,"This job was ok it's the staff and mangers who made it hard to work there "
bad,"cvs treat their staff like disposable underwear, they dont appreciate good working staff members. They dont like giving pay increased and the dont train the staff"
bad,"You are a number as an employee and not valued by anyone.  Everything is based on metrics and if you do not meet them then you get written up.  In the mean time they cut hours but expect more with less help and hours, not to mention people lives are in the hands of Pharmacy."
bad,"i was with the company for 10 years. when i reported workplace violence incident to the manager he ignored it. when i reported the incident to district leader he also ignored it. then retaliated with false statements on termination letter. i was too late to report it to OSHA, they have 30 days deadline."
bad,"No chance for advancement."
bad,"No one has balls to make executive decisions at the store level in CVS."
bad,"CVS claims they are ""helping people on their path to better health"", which is laughable as they are constantly asking their employees to do more with less time, people, and resources. Their pharmacies are severely understaffed, comprising patient safety and employee health to make their money. It is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt and CVS finally realizes what a horrible job they are doing. "
bad,Management is not good at this location. You will be promised hours then weeks later your hours will be cut to save payroll for management bonuses. There is no room for growth at this location and you will be doing management work for minimum wage
bad,"Overworked, underappreciated & not compensated for services. Communication within the company is absent.  Many unnecessary and unrealistic metrics.  Bilingual employees not compensated & underappreciated."
bad,Horrible working experience.                                            Abnormal work flow.  Moving like a wheel. Never enough staff.     No paid time off.
bad,"I offered them open availability for every day and every hour, they could not offer me more than 10 hours a week. The pharmacy manager was often rude and would put you down for trying to even help and leave you doing remedial tasks. Over all an unfriendly manager and weak amount of time to do anything. I would not recommend this company."
bad,"I would not work at this place to learn, grow or better myself as a technician. They schedule so poorly. We are extremely understaffed when everyone gets off, and new pharmacist doesnt know much."
bad,CVS is the worst job to be at. They will through everything on you and make you double the work. You won't get treated fairly or get the pay raise. Management is terrible and HR does nothing to help.
bad,The district manager is very young and  doesn't  have any experience on how to run a store she was infact a pharmacy manager. Terrible choice I didn't  want to deal with her one more day I  found an other job and left. Terrible company that makes bad choices terrible benefi ts
bad,"They allow gross mismanagement which leads to unfair scheduling practices and negligence. There is supposedly a chain of personnel to go to with complaints, however it is ineffectual. After working for this company and dedicating years of hard work and receiving no assistance when I needed it, I will not only never recommend working here, I will never even shop in the store chain or enter its doors"
bad,I don’t know how this company still manages to take over smaller companies. They pay you garbage they expect you to do everything and then to top it off when you train the new staff they’re making just as much is you were making and you’ve been there for a longer period of time and know your stuff. Worst company I’ve ever worked for they don’t value you at all you’re just another number. At best you might get some pizza once in a blue moon if corporate stops by. But other than that you’re a cvs slave.  Learned a lot but the amount you’re expected to do on a daily basis for the compensation is not worth it at all
bad,"Very biased, lack of Reward for the  people that work hard .. lack of good leadership, PTO is advanced and not earned .. people come and go regularly , very stressful work environment , lack of training for your role .. lots of changes and additions to your job tasks at a moments notice"
bad,Depending on the managers and customers; that will ultimately make or break the experience for some. Without the right management it is very hard to run a store.
bad,Bottom line! The worse place to work! Management is horrible! They dont care about family! Discrimination to the max! Just dont bother unless you are desperate!
bad,No benefits. You buy your own insurance. No proper training and management expect you to grasp everything in dew days you're there and leave you in the battle unprepared. Always Understaffed. Fast-paced.
bad,Very demanding job even though product is being delivered communication with staff lacks leadership sometimes there’s favoritism offers very little encouragement and something to look forward to coming to work
bad,working as a technician for cvs i believe is only a job for young college students. This is not a place where you can grow within the company or move up career wise
bad,"Very Hostile; not friendly environment.  Lead and managers were not helpful with issues, no additional training was offered when asked.  Lead and management would often retaliate if questioned."
bad,"Cvs is only good if you have good managers. If not, you’ll only go as far as they let you and they will use you for everything. Some stores are dirtier and messier than others, DMs are always bugging with deadlines and things that need to be done but most of the time there’s not even enough help to do it. Pharmacy staff is always on their own wave, super annoying to deal with as a manager. Backroom uokeep is unbearable, new things being sent by CVS managers to the store every week to give you more work. EXHAUSTING only work here if you’re a cashier and you’re ringing ppl up."
bad,it was a ok job they weren't giving me many hours at all but it was an ok job for the most part the pay was not good at all. An the management was ok/
bad,"CVS is the worst company to work for. The organization as a whole is horrible. The pay sucks and they support racist and homophobic behaviors. Management states that there is an open door policy but there really isn't and when you report unethical behavior, they try to cover it up."
bad,"There are no breaks, you have to wait until you have no customer to get a break which could be way padt the 4 hour legal working limit. No benefits, good awful hours, terrible management. I would not recommend to work here unless your life depends on it, the pay isnt even enough to live in a roach motel! Save your time and soul and look elsewhere."
bad,"Management has to much authority. They don't listen to their workers. They don't like you taking a break.carma is -------"
bad,"Management is awful. Team isn’t a team. I’ve been cursed by management and nothing was done. Pharmacist jokes about someone’s family dying and gets no retaliation. Managers are lazy and make lower management do their dirty work. Ex: cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming, front facing. Part of the job, but I’ve never seen them do it. But when it’s not done said person with task gets wyelled at. Unrealistic goals. Management tells me I get distracted too easily after I was given 5 different task in less than 5 minutes. No hours. I understand that corporate has a budget they have to stay in, but 25 hours a week is not something to live off of. Sometimes employees only get 10. MAX. Hire on extra help when you current employees are struggling to get hours as is. Only get hours you were promised in interview when management goes on vacation. You’re used as a convince. Management makes rude remarks that are directed towards you but they try to cover it up with other words said around it. SPITEFUL. I’ve never been in such an unhealthy work environment. Unless you know them. You’re trash to them. Some days are good others are bad. My mental health was ruined working here. I’ve never cried at a job until I started working here. It’s exciting for the first month. But I don’t appreciate my bosses talking to me like I’m stupid every single day."
bad,"CVS claims to be a great place to work. This is not true, they are racist and play favoritism. They don't allow you to use the work-life balance they advertise as a benefit. The insurance premiums continue to rise although they purchased Aetna. The workload constantly increase, however, there is a shortage of staff because the turn over is very high"
bad,You have to kiss  up to  management to keep your job a very  stressful environment no payroll store manager have to do must of the work and work 6 to 7 days a week
bad,At first I was super excited to be getting this job and being promoted in less than a year. Then the company's true nature began to shine and I couldn't handle it anymore.
bad,"I would give ZERO stars if I could.  If you do not KISS then you get no payroll to run your store effectively.  DISTRICT LEADERS allow extra payroll hours to their favorite store managers.  Most of the store managers end up WORKING UP TO 70 OR MORE HOURS A WEEK!  "
bad,"Do not under any conditions work for this company.  Training is a joke and often forged for corporate, work load is insane, breaks are ignored--and forget about getting 2 minutes to go to the bathroom.  No time for that with far too few Techs working.  Broken equipment is the least of the issues, pushing any and every cash grabbing program down customer's throats is the only important task--corporate wants those metrics met!!!  Absolutely awful workplace.  "
bad,"Stressful! They only care about metrics and numbers."
bad,"I was trained and certified as a pharmacy technician which comes with an overwhelming work load and a very under-compensating $10/hour to start.  The cashiers in the front make the exact same wage which is completely ridiculous. Oh and u are required to perform that job as well as knowing where each and every item is in the store including makeup, food, etc."
bad,Work-life balance is absolutely terrible. Most managers will generally be in the buildings BY THEMSELVES expected to do the job of 6 people. Stay away!
bad,Too many modules the store is unorganized the new guy gets no remorse from customers nor employees managers need more maintenance. Let’s just say have you ever heard of the big guys not caring about the little guys well work for Cvs and you’ll see it up front closely.
bad,"CVS doesn't care about their employees OR customers. They just want you to work so CVS can make the big bucks for themselves.  Computers were out of date, no hours for the employees to give the customers the customer service they needed, wages were poor, and so stressful because of not enough help."
bad,"Management was not experienced,There was favourtism and lack of training. Customer service wasn't the greatest either by management. Customer service training would be great also."
bad,"Working for CVS they want to pay you as little as possible while expecting you to do the job of 3 people, there's a double standard between day and night shifts favoring day shift. Management is a joke 90% of them don't care and can never be found and when you do finally talk to someone you're treated poorly to say the least or if you're lucky you'll find them asleep inside thier office."
bad,"Per the company, the customer is always right. I had an horrible experience with a customer and tried to avoid the situation. I contacted loss prevention to advise on the crazy customer and I got fired. I loved working there but a lot of favoritism and no recognition or incentives. Lack of correct initial training and requirements. No consistency. A lot of hard workers."
bad,Dont do it.. under paid and over worked million dollar company who only cares about the buisness and not there employees pharmacist there was horrible drama making.. angey customers all.day long
bad,Started out as a good place to work but quickly became unbearable with all the micro managing.  Constant threats and unreal expectations.  Everything ends badly at this company and turnover at the store manager position is at an all time high.
bad,CVS is the worst company to work for no one if fair over there most store manager will never do anything all they do is sit in the office and never help with what need to be done in store. Upper management of the company only cares about money so good for bit you someone in your family is not doing well except to never get to go see then because they will not give you the time off. Or even help you out to go see them.CVS is why I never got to go see my dad that was diagnosed with cancer and passed walllaway with is
bad,Very stressful!  Management does not allow you to use more help.  All of my employees (4) that have been there over 20 years left because of the unrealistic expectations.  I am also looking for other employment.
bad,They constantly hire and train then just let go of whom they do not like. They do not like when you ask questions & always send you home because they said there’s no work. Training is totally different when you are doing actual work. Be careful because they do not care about their staffing agency contractors. Not a full time 8 hours shift. Be careful. Don’t be fooled!
bad,They put you through 2 weeks of training that has nothing to do with the actual job. The workers get high on prescription pills while working and supervisors are sleeping together. Buffalo grove location
bad,they continue to cut payroll to save money but keep piling work load on.. the amount of pay does not match the level of work expectations. In addition they offer no training for staff so retention is low because the incentive to stay doesnt exist. i stayed as long as i did because every year i would aay it cant get any worse. but it did! yearly they cut back in order to ad more businesses. ididmswnse
bad,They do not do what they say they are going to do for you. Then hire in management from other drug store chains that have shut down for lack of business and the management they hire is awful and don’t know anything at all instead of hiring from in store and letting someone there advance that actually knows what they are doing. Very poorly run and won’t pay what you’re worth. You have to unload trucks and wait on people while you put stock up and work alone all at the same time.
bad,They do not value employees no matter how long you have been there. I gave this store two years of my life and in that time almost none of the original people I worked there were left. The company only cares about profit rather than their people. They cut over 30 hours in exchange for self checkout and are money hungry savages.
bad,Don't waste your time when u first start it's ok but then ya hrs get cut the managers their rude and phoney got transferred and this manager is like my last one of job not cut out to what you think don't waste time if u wanna slave like a dog with little pay
bad,Cvs would be a great place to work if they didn’t cut hours. They company don’t care about there employees cutting hours. Full time tech getting 10-15 hours a week they real cheap. Cvs can’t even guarantee you hours but want  u to do all the work for less pay and in a short period of time. It’s not a good company to work for .
bad,"I would never advise anyone to work for this company. They are horrible in the management area and Human Resources department. If you want any advancement or to move up in the company, don't apply."
bad,Worked here of over a year. Only got worse. Short pay checks. Would not work with changing availability. Took over 6 months to earn pto. And over a year to get dental and vision insurance.
bad,"CVS has recently increased pay for hourly employees, but cut lots of hours for hourly employees to compensate, endangering workers and customers. Tasks that used to be delegated by position have been reduced to the responsibilities of only one or two people.  Bathroom breaks, daily tasks, and major projects have all become impossible while the company has adopted a ""no excuses"" culture. I encourage family and friends to not work here, nor choose the company as a pharmacy due to its loss of vision and purpose."
bad,"poor working conditions, no family understanding, overworked and underpaid. no room for advancement...…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….."
bad,I have work for an independent pharmacy and when Cvs took over they do not take care of their employees it’s all about customer they do not take care of the employees and I believe there is an age discrimination
bad,When I first started working here it was great. I had full time hours and a great team to work with.  My then manager has since quit and replaced with an old Staples manager. He has turned this store upside down with his dictating racist attitude towards employees and customers.  We get daily complaints about him.
bad,Worst management ever. Inexperienced perverts and idiots hired that has never worked in pharmacy. Promotion is based on popularity snitches and suck ups. Worst pay. Over worked. The term team is a joke. Very divided.
bad,This job was extremely terrible. Management horrible. Teamwork non existent.  Very stressful job. I was glad to not work for this company.............
bad,I gave 1 star only because it would not let me have nothing selected. I worked at CVS health for 6 years in a couple different departments so I can attest to poor management on all levels. Law suit pending it’s that bad.
bad,I was working hard and my boss told be his gonna promote me as a manager in traning but after i come back from vacation my manager and districk got transfer the. New manager say i have to show i am how work  Which means I have to wait 6 moment I already week 2 year then i quit instaed of keep wating
bad,I worked for this company for about two years and it’s terrible. They run a whole store with only 2-3 top people working . Long lines mean mean customers.  They pay the minimum and only give you a raise of 10cents annually .
bad,"the hours I worked at this place was chaotic in that we were under manned , I learned my more established co-worker felt that you were trying to take there jobs if you asked to be shown how to do something.The most enjoyable part was ending my shift"
bad,First real job that I had and I got fired for forgetting to pay 2 bottles of water. They didn’t care about my home state situación and didn’t even ask now I live alone and have no job and go to school. Basically left me homeless they didn’t even warn me they were going to fire me so I can try and find another job they just fired me and made me signed something so they wouldn’t look bad said I was just suspended but it turns out I was just fierd
bad,"They do not care about anyone in the company besides themselves and shareholders thats it, if you not one of the two good luck. They will give you a spoon and tell you to dig your own grave."
bad,"Horrible company !"
bad,Overall this was a stressful job and not managed well. The area was not safe. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. I really hope the company will improve for any new employees.
bad,"worst place to work ever, no payroll, demands are too high.  They keep adding more and more work to do, with less and less payroll to accomplish it, then they write you up when you can't physically get it done."
bad,"Management plays favorites. They will let their favorites do whatever they want. They can sleep all shift and put their work load on others. They can listen to music loudly and leave whenever they want for as long as they want. CVS will not fire you because they don’t want you to go to unemployment so they will make you miserable until you quit. If you apply, good luck. You won’t be there long I’m sure."
bad,cvs was a decent company to work for until the store manager that came in had a problem with competition and did not like being overshadowed.  then there was issues and started making it difficult place to work
bad,No human resource support. No one to answer questions. Nothing to protect your status or min hours. Store managers are not trained to be or allowed to be a human resource support.
bad,I was with CVS for 2 years as a pharmacy technician. One of the worst decisions ever. Quit 2 months ago and I’ve never been happier. They don’t care about employees AT ALL. They treat you horribly. They don’t care about good employees/hard workers. Never steady hours. I was promised over 5 times in my 2 years that I would get full time hours next schedule but instead they hire the worst new people and cut your hours even more.
bad,"They will fire you at any moment, no warnings just so they can pay a newbie a lot less. Management sexually harasses a lot and doesnt treat women respectfully. H.R doesnt do there job properly. They will give you random writes up just to have a reason to fire you"
bad,Terrible place to work. Why am I being asked to type more words. There is no reason for this. I should just close this window now. CVS is a terriblle place to work
bad,"You go in happy to work. In short time makes being customer. Friendly an act. ""false"""
bad,Overlapping your schedule. Upper management is not very smart. Laid off people from a 24hr pharmacy and still run the pharmacy with just three technician
bad,job is easy but director says she has an open door policy but gets angry when you come to her. no room for advancement restrooms are always broken no schedule flexibility . pay is horrible
bad,The management says whatever you want to hear to get you to work for them. Then they Give you good hours for a few weeks and then they cut your hours and hire more people. I had to get another job to stay there just to make it worth it.
bad,"Unfair work environment "
bad,"If you don't mind being yelled at and called every name in the book by Medicare participants while maintaining a empathetic attitude this is the place!! If you don't mind nosey, can't mind my own business over grown children, this is the place for you. If you don't mind kissing a** this is the place for you. If you don't mind busting your a** to maintain call scores at low pay this is for you. Dont forget to be a favorite as**kisser to the supervisor it gets you places faster"
bad,People treat you terrible and you are forced to pretend like someone throwing items at you is no big deal over a simple coupon for .50¢ The people who also are supposed to help don’t exactly do their jobs correct and to test your they put items back onto the carts when you go to do them to make sure you are actually doing the carts causing more work and less efficienty
bad,"Hired in as part time driver to work 5 to 8 hr. Shifts,but the shifts or routes take at least 10 to 12 hrs.to complete,this is driving on very curvey and dangerous roads in the middle of the night.They tell one lie after another when interviewing you."
bad,"I cannot stress enough not to work here.  You will be punished if you go to HR or reach out to the ethics line regarding direct issues and it is NOT anonymous. "
bad,"If you are a technician, be prepared to be thrown under the bus and yelled at constantly. Federal laws regarding controls and narcotics are in place for a reason and management will undermine you at every possible turn to keep script count up. No technician wants to actually work there, especially when you can't make ends meet on the lousy hourly rate given. No room for advancement at all"
bad,Schedule fluctuates so much.  Can never guarantee full time hours or benefits.   Cutting tech hours so much yet goals and expectations continue to go up.  Understaffed and concerns for patient safety.
bad,"The concepts CVS Health promotes are spot on, but the implementation to follow out CVS Mission doesn't match up. Management lacks professionalism especially in the Pharmacy."
bad,"Very discriminating company. This company does not allow you to reach a certain pay grade, upon getting close to top pay rate you will be fired, this ia1 especially for people of color."
bad,"A typical workday would start at 5am on call with the developers in India. Grab breakfast on the go without slowing the meetings. Continue mentoring meetings on the way to the office and start writing code and debugging code while still in meetings helping to mentor other programmers in India. Code reviews with people from India until 10am. Continue writing code for another 2 hours and then grab a quick lunch also on the go and get back to the office to finish lunch while discussing architecture and coding best practices with the on-site developers. Continue writing and debugging and mentoring until 7pm. Then grab dinner on the go and get back to the hotel just in time to start more meetings with India. Continue mentoring and code reviews with the India teams until 2am. Grab a few hours of sleep and start again at 5am! Don't forget to catch your flight home, flight also leaves at 5am so you'll have to leave the hotel at 2:30am. I actually fell asleep writing code, and I was still typing in my sleep!!!"
bad,"The managers lie to you and to your contractor. They get mad if you dress better or if your hair is better. They will try and bring you down and fire you if you disagree with a valid reason. Do not work here they do not pay good and lie about benefits. HR does not help if someone attaches you , they continue to let you get harassed"
bad,"Constantly bending and straining your back all night to grab pieces to fill totes.  Nobody told me what my shift was and what position I'd have until I asked somebody in HR on my way out of orientation, which was a useless experience since they didn't have anyone for a tour and the lady who read the PowerPoint was exhausted because she just found out she had to do it after a long shift.  Computer training was done a week into the job, and they told you the answers and to skip everything.  Didn't see my supervisor until a week and a half into the job.  Warehouse is as hot as an oven with a million slipping hazards.  They had dozens of OSHA incidents by half of the year had passed, which made tons of sense when you see the place.  Constant conveyor jams, loads of rusty, unfunctional rollers, falling debris, and slippery floors.  They have the strictest policies of any warehouse I've been to.  No outside water bottles, MP3s, box cutters, tobacco of any kind, cell phones, food, bags, or ibuprofen allowed on the floor.  They give you water bottles, but they're tiny, have no clips, are sippy cup-style, need to be covered in paper towels from the bathroom to avoid condensation, and have to be refilled in fountains (not coolers) that are 100 miles away through the line area which is narrower than one car seat and usually lined on the floor with towers of totes.  They make you walk across the street to smoke because of their dumb health initiative.  The tablets you use for orders are mounted on a cart using the cheapest, breakable plastic I've ever seen.  You're rated for everything"
bad,"Work life balance is non-existent, expectations are unrealistic, you are treated as though you must comply with outrageous work demands or you will lose your job. Management is absent and condescending. I took a $20k pay cut intentionally just to leave the job because I had to have a pillow and a blanket in my office and I never saw my family."
bad,Poor upper management that dont care about thier employees or customers just fill prescriptions at a dangerously fast pace unrealistic expectations from start to finish EVERYTHING IS MONEY
bad,"No career advancement even with apparently sincere comments regarding training, which later turned out to be a ploy to get more hours out of the part timers. Became seriously ill after cleaning up human feces in the bathroom with no help for the inevitable hospital visits due to being part time."
bad,"Techs are expected to do everything while understaffed. It was frustrating when customers were rightfully so upset with us because we didn't have their medications done as there was no time to produce them. Most were rationally upset. Ironically, staff was cut down at night when there was the highest influx of customers due to getting out of doctors appointments. During the 3-7 PM window there would only be 3 techs on and all 3 stations had a constant stream of customers, there was no time to count the customers medications. Also, the metrics where we were expected to sell refills to customers and have a sheet printed out of our weekly performance to be thrown in our faces. The higher ups were scared of corporate to the point that we were meticulously coached on how to word by word ask someone if they would like to refill their medication, even to the point we were supposed to cheat the system by putting them through early so our store wouldn't get in trouble. What really pushed me over the edge was knowing one of the reasons the pharmacists (who already make 120k/yr) cared so much was because their bonuses were held over their heads and would be affected by all of this. Lastly, I wasn’t trained properly and most of the techs and pharmacists were rude when I asked questions. It seemed as though they didn’t want me to learn so I could do front register because that’s what people don’t want to do the most. And if you’re new they’ll want you to stay there for as long as possible so they don’t have to deal with it."
bad,Higher management does not care about employees’ personal lives or development. Hours are given based on seniority and favoritism. Annual raises are nonexistent- I worked there for 3 years and made the same hourly rate as the day I got hired.
bad,This place does not care about it's employees or the needs of the customers they serve. They are only about the money and don't pay well enough for the headache.
bad,Management is poor! They do not value your dedication and hard work. All in behave of the benefits they can get but when its in favor of the employees its not even considered.
bad,"Expectations are high for the pay. They under pay their staff. They dont value the employee, they only exploit them with all the unrealistic metrics. Forcing staff to solicit the patients in order to fill medications patients dont need."
bad,"When I first started we had a good manager. But after a couple months he took over another store and an ogre took over, her literal name is Stormy. This was the worst manager I have ever encountered. Does not know how to run a place, shows complete favoritism to old employees, and creates an unhealthy, unhappy environment using scare tactics, causing my rating to be very low."
bad,"CVS was a horrible place to work. My co workers were amazing, but the higher ups want you to work for no pay. They tell you you will be written up if you stay on the clock past your shift, but they also cut hours so much that it is impossible for anyone to complete the day's task on time. Then you are told that if you do not complete your tasks you will be written up."
bad,"To work at CVS you have to go to an mandatory orientation. After the orientation the manager calls you in and you have to do mandatory modules. The modules are so long and useless. You have to get 100 percent on each quiz or you'll have to restart the whole quiz again. They also don't tell you which one you get wrong so you'll just have to do trial and error. The location I am currently working at the manager, doesn't care about your outside life and gives you horrible schedules so you won't have time to hang out with friends or family. Since nobody wants to be there, nobody would take your day or switch schedules with you. If your schedule says you leave at 10 that's a lie because the earliest you'd probably leave is 11 pm or 12 am and they expect you to be able to come back at 8 am not caring about your travel time. If you talk to the store manager about it he won't care and just say that it's the job world even though it's not. People stay at this place for about a week to a month and end up quitting because of the store managers lack of care."
bad,good place to work if you like being over worked and underpaid. Technicians literally work for free after they clock out to get the job done and keep pharmacy tidy. Hours are disappearing every week. Less staff to handle more work. Not sure what type of business model this is but it is definitely not serving the employees or consumers.
bad,"They want you to work without pay or technician support. The District Leader are rude and most them don't have high school diploma, but they are as White as they get. The company lack diversity, not a place if you are looking for work and life balance."
bad,"The training does nothing to help you understand what you're doing, the pharmacist are awful in help with problems and not talking to you like you're a complete idiot."
bad,Cvs says they care about there employee and there pt but they cut the hours to 63 per week when we do 250 scripts per day and give there full time employees 30 hours and they don’t care if you have bills or kids very selfish company
bad,"Forget about having support staff working at CVS.  The metrics are impossible, management is 100% out of touch, and lunch breaks do not exist.  The working conditions at the company should be illegal.  They honestly probably are.  As CVS continues to cut hours at the expense of anything and everything else, the working conditions become more and more unbearable.  There may be worse working conditions out there somewhere, but I can't think of any at this time.  This is a terrible company to work for, and I'd advise anyone to work anywhere but CVS."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Where to begin? Working at CVS for 4 years under 4 different pharmacists, 3 district managers and 3 staff pharmacists has been horrible to say the least. Managment asks for hilariously unrealistic expectations to be met. The district leader has asked employees to enroll customers in programs without consent and even if they are declined. Worked for a racist homophobic pharmacist named David Derby. Empliyees are given awful hours and treated as eas replacable."
bad,"CVS used to be a good company to work for but they are horrible now."
bad,"The manager does not lead by example. He has poor work ethic. He takes frequent vacation days every month and does not work every weekend. He leaves the management of the pharmacy and store to incompetent shift leads who are not knowledgeable enough to manage a high volume store. He has his favorite 3 employees who he relies on to report to him about the other few employees who remain. This of course creates hostility rather than team work. These employees in turn are guaranteed set schedules which do not include weekends and evenings. There is one in particular who never completes her work and spends her time gossiping about other employees. When I asked her what her position is, she could not answer. I was told by another manager that she has been there a long time and she has a personal relationship with the manager. I believe a manager should not show favoritism or nepotism.Therefore the other employees have do the work of many during the store""s peak hours.Twenty two employees quit during the eight months that I have been employed there.They do not even bother formally quitting, they just don't show up.The manager calls them and they do not answer their phones. They have also left because of his negative comments toward them. There are only a few remaining who are currently seeking other employment. He now relies on college students who work few hours and will probably leave in May. In addition there have been many complaints about him from customers. He really does not show care not even for the customers."
bad,Long work days with zero service level agreement. All claims had to be processed the same day. Work is not assigned fairly to employees. Training can be approved upon.
bad,My last manager was so disrespectful... Did not value employee input... Would treat employees like slaves... Talk about them negatively to the other employees and then gossip about them. We dreaded his presence.....
bad,Management is clueless about everything. Refused to promote even ur doing a good job.hire outside for fulltime when there are employees willing and able to work fulltime.play favorites.enployees are disrespectful to patients.and they ignore ignore ignore.hopefully u get on a good team .if not u will hate everyday of it.
bad,"A typical day for a supervisor consists of the following: Stocking shelves, helping customers locate items, and completing all additional tasks assigned by your store manager. CVS is a fast paced job, must be able to multi task with cashier duties, stocking and assisting customers and addressing inventory.Would not recommend this position to anyone. I repeat, continue searching elsewhere."
bad,Bad bad bad leadership..Lies..Constant instability in how you do things day to day..Cross train you in order to get your maximum effort  but no pay increase..Force you to do job positions you're not trained to do and when you speak your opinion about not feeling safe they will fire you for insubordination..
bad,"I was a cashier. I was basically hired to provide excellent customer service, because the current managers were unable to. The store i worked at was horrible with gang members, crackheads, and homeless outside the entrance of the store. They had weak security guards that would allow anyone to come in the store and steal."
bad,Took my peace of mind and leaving was the best decision ever made. Never again will I work for cvs companies. No room for growth. Promises aren’t kept.
bad,"Enjoyed my work but stood for hours while working. Some management did not care for the technicians at all. More importantly, necessary to work on holidays"
bad,I was doing way more work than I was getting paid for and I was getting calls from my team all the time at home bc nobody could get ahold of the manager! I was handling everything that should have been handled by the store manager! Only to be fired for something I did not do!
bad,CVS is another company that has a revolving door Staff.  They can’t keep people because as soon as you start working for CVS they run you to your grave by giving you a schedule that affects your personal life with little to no pay.  You were stuck running a store with little to no staff because of their terrible culture
bad,To much favoritism with supervisor and manager. They hired a manager with no experience in a warehouse. She was a stay at home mom which she probably did a Bad job as well.
bad,Do not work here you want I’ll hate it and you will want to leave because of bad management please do not work at this location cooperate does not care bout employees feelings period. Dont
bad,A typical day at work is chaotic. Workplace culture is very stressful. Company has changed a lot. I use to very much enjoy working here. It is challenging to successfully complete tasks without the proper amount of staff to work with.
bad,"I have never been so miserable in a job. Could write a noble on the messed up things this company does. Main focus, does not appreciate workers at all, ill take my 0.03 cent raise to a company that would take care of its employees"
bad,"This company only cares about higher ups, CEOs not regular employees. I worked 9 years benefits are extremely low. Cutting hours and expect you to do the same amount of work with less employees and less time."
bad,Worst job of my life... do not work for this company!!! This job is your life! There’s no work life balance. The management is run very poorly. Never will work here again!
bad,I have met and trained many people within the company. Most start out eager and then later realize no one cares. I enjoy my actual job and I love my customers which is mostly why I have stayed. There is NO job security and you are replaceable and it feels that way every day.
bad,"The training program would be good if it was done by a professional training manager not someone who doesn't even know their own job."
bad,As a pharmacy tech you need to learn a lot. It is great that CVS offers the teachings themselves versus you having to take and pay for outside learnings. The pay is ridiculous.  Absolutely unlivable wages.  Hours are all over the place. Breaks are short.
bad,I worked in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician and i hated my job. The old people are so mean and demanding. The atmosphere as a whole was just not a good experience .
bad,"Upset that I wasted my time here.  Management shows favorites.  Half hour lunch on weekends but working 8 hours. 1 hour lunch when working 11 hours.  Training sucked. They tell you, you will make $50/hr but then you only get 60 hours so your really not making a decent wage.  Not appropriated."
bad,I was being harassed by the pharmacist and I made complaints and that cause me to end up loosing my job I felt helpless there was no one I could seek help from after I left there was y’all that the pharmacist was still harassing other techs this was very stressful and I never felt safe
bad,",Pharmacies are very busy places .. So multi tasking is a huge plus in the Pharmacy industry !!!!  It would be nice to get more hours, CVS cuts hours alot, so you are at risk for losing your health insurance if you are hired on full time and then store hours are cut ,then your status will change if you drop below a certain amount of hours..So that can be a bit much"
bad,Not much to say not a friendly environment. management is very messy and unprofessional they walk around on there phones all day. Telling confidential information about workers.
bad,I use to work there they dont let you enjoy your 10 min breaks or your 30hour lunch you can not be buying anything in the store because they think you are stealing really bad place instead for them to be catching the bad guys of stealing they are on the employees
bad,The worst job I've ever had. They hire new grads to run the pharmacy which makes for a chaotic workplace. Specifically stores in Bellmore NY. Stay away.
bad,CVS Pharmacy micromanages it’s employees and put  unreasonable  expectations all it’s employees. They want you to  execute and possible plans with little help. They do compensate you enough for the work they expect you to do.
bad,This was a very unprofessional job. Management was truly all over the place no one is ever on the same page. The hours are very low 2-3 5/6 hour shifts per week  with biweekly pay equals no money.
bad,"A horrible company that does not care about their employees, would recommend to my worst enemy. I got less than ten hours a week 2 weeks before Christmas, was told I would get way more. Force you to work in pharmacy and cuts your hours in the front end when you do."
bad,"This job is full of sh.....nd very stressful . Management is horrible and they show favoritism. Stay away from CVS . They don’t care if it’s snowing , they want you to risk your life . I can recall a time it was a bad snow storm and the employees got stuck at the job and had to sleep in the call center smh ."
bad,just a boring job of counter sales clerk.  no advancement unless you wanted to relocate.no communication with employees regarding sales or specials. too many store managers in and out or changed.
bad,"I worked at the DC in the HR department, HR Manager had his preferences and was not someone you can count on having your back.  Was not a fair person with his staff."
bad,The only job I've ever had where HR is trying to fire you. Constantly getting harassed by management. The management completely throws seniority out the door and does whatever they want.
bad,"Cvs is HORRIBLE!! It will own your soul! It seems like any other retail job a first, then they cut. And they cut. And they cut. You are expected to do the work of 5 people at once"
bad,"Expectation of field management does not match the payroll allocated or the business model of the stores.  The math does not work in the majority of assignments, but employees and managers are told to work faster, harder, and longer to achieve impossible results.  Typical store manager week was 70 hours a week, with that expectation supported by field management.  Feedback and direction is often requested, but seldom offered.  I would not recommend working here to anyone for any reason."
bad,That company is so unorganized and really do not care about their employees. They are not willing to work with you if you have kids or go to school. Everything is about them and their needs. If you cannot comply then they will find a way to get rid of you.
bad,"I will never work there again. Low pay, inconsistent scheduling, constantly under-staffed, apathetic management, stressful work environment, only management is considered full time and there for the only ones eligible for benefits."
bad,"Avoid CVS like it's AIDs.  Benefits keep getting taken away, insurance keeps getting worse.  Just another corporate company stepping on the backs of it's employees to appease share holders.  Nothing new, despite what some marketing company they paid might have you think"
bad,"Cvs doesn’t care about or acknowledge their employees for anything really for those who work hard they don’t get anything in return but bounced around from one place to another. Management at my store in particular sucks for both front store and pharmacy there isn’t any real leadership but everyone wants to use their authority at the wrong times and management for both front and pharmacy can never take responsibility for what they do, I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone , that is unless your goal in life is to want high blood pressure and stress on and off the clock daily.My job title was also changed without a reasonable conversation being had with me first , I was told it would be changed even after I asked for it not to be in case I needed to get hours during the summertime but like I said no one talked to me about it just told me what they were GOING TO DO instead of asking what worked best for me."
bad,CVS is transitioning away from front store and moving into a more healthcare oriented Store. It is constantly understaffed and the hours are long. Many times going with one day off a week. Only having two employees at any given time to run the entire store. Often times being left alone. Not a good company to make a career unless you are a Pharmacist or in Upper Management.
bad,Cvs has lost touch with its mission and values. They do not care about the health of its employees or consumers. Only apply if you do not value your sanity.
bad,Management is pitiful.  They try to find something to fire you on. They train several people in the position you're working in to replace you at a moments notice
bad,"This place went downhill fast especially after production supervisor Ben started, they lie about overtime and saturdays and don’t tell the truth on anything, they lie about the number we need to hit, don’t communicate at all and talk to you like a child. The best thing about the place was the people you meet, as in coworkers, if you can go somewhere else I would, they say that they will give you a raise in the first 30 days which is a lie, most people have been there over 6 months and never got a raise, this place is a joke and has a high turnover as you can tell from all the open interviews they do. You’ve been warned."
bad,Management sucks except for assistant manager and the overall location is dangerous and unpredictable. Health insurance is the worst of the worst. so much for health focused company  you should consider providing prestigious health insurance to your hard working employeees
bad,"If you plan on ever working for CVS in Compton.  DON'T DO IT. The manager there is an awful person. Unless you can manage to become his ""friend"" you will never be treated like a human being. You will always close and work every weekend. You won't get any holidays off EVER unless you're one of his friends. There is no work/ life balance if you're always closing and working. You will almost never see your family or friends. Honestly unless you're desperate, don't do it. The management is sloppy and useless. You might as well be working on your own."
bad,All your hard work does not get recognized. Managers are horrible.  They do not treat their employees with respect.  You are treated as a disposable robot.
bad,"My 2nd time here was horrible. Lied about what I would make, had me go through entire tech program, training over kill, poor communication Do Not Work Here Ever!"
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Bad pay, too many supervisors, too much nepatism, not enough life/work balance, and no room for advancement."
bad,"I would not suggest anyone to work at CVS, management was horrible well my new manager. It seems to take over a decade for someone to be promoted within. Hours are terrible. They overwork you for little pay! I think if you want to work for CVS the pharmacy is the way to go, not front store."
bad,"Working in cvs is bad they do not give your breaks or be nice to you they slave you do they won’t work bad experience. Discrimination against foreigners employees"
bad,Was paid peanuts for what I was Expected to deal with as a Shift manager. DM was also horrible never gave praise just harped on the things he found wrong.
bad,"The company's outward presentation is all about heart and helping people.  The façade is fake particularly when it comes to it's own employees.  Quick to judge, uninformed snap decisions being made by field management.  Poor field management.  All about money and satisfying stockholders."
bad,"To put it in a nutshell, CVS does not follow what they preach. They pretend to care but in reality only care about themselves. As an organization they do not seem to care about employees resulting in a high turn over rate."
bad,"Worst place to work. They treat you like a criminal everyday with bag checks. The whareroom is gross and never cleaned. Managment is help with negative sales. "
bad,"Only care about making a ridiculous rate, management is a complete joke, a bunch of morons. A lot of discrimination and favoritism. Also racism is a problem within management but there all part of the good ol boy system so nothing will be done.."
bad,They pay minimum wage .  They never scheduled enough people so you end up doing the work of two or more people or have unhappy customers!!! The benefits they offer are so expensive that you can barely afford to use them. They need upgrade the computers they use so they brake down all the time!!!! I think they are from the 70s .
bad,"This company has a lot of potential if they cared more about their employees and less about how much money they were making.  Employees are worked to death, way underpaid, and under appreciated.  The pharmacy was never staffed appropriately either."
bad,I mostly felt bad for the customers when they called.  There is very little training or assistance provided to help explain why medications cost so much.  Calling other departments for prior authorizations was a nightmare and caused long hold times for the customer which frustrated them even more.
bad,I was hired 5 years ago as an SMIT and got lost in the shuffle. Upper management is always changing . It’s a long story. I’m very disappointed with this company. This company does not care about their employees.
bad,"This place is very stressful and they don't train their employees well."
bad,"I worked at CVS as a pharmacy technician in 2012. I cannot believe how many mistakes are made in the pharmacy. And I only got paid $8.40 per hour. And if you app same question to five different employees, you'll get five different answers."
bad,They preach that they are a great company but they don't practice it. They expect their employees to work hard but do not reward them in any way at all.
bad,Management was absolutely horrible. Didnt take time to really train you and management was rude disrespectful not understanding would threaten you if u tried to call out
bad,Schedule sucks you have to literally go to other stores just to get hours. Good forbid you get sick they act like it’s a crime to call out on your worse days. No Empathy at all. There’s time where you work 10 hours straight with no breaks at all. It’s a horrible company!!!
bad,your pharmacist will pick favorites and show them. the rest of us get stuck doing whatever the favorites don't want to do as well as our own jobs we will be judged for asking for help
bad,"Toxic environment , lack of communication between patients and staff.  Poor scheduling with patients in receiving treatment both in home and in the center."
bad,This company  expects  you to do to much for a little bit of pay . They don't  keep their word.  And you will never get a raise. The culture  there is one of a high school
bad,This was the worse job that I have ever worked. Overtime was a must. They didnt plan correctly for the holiday rush. Where we were working 6 days a week 12 hour shifts. If you had weekend plans well cancel them because this company expected you to put them first. They didnt care about your home life. It's all about them or nothing. If you have ever heard the saying dont work your self to death for a job that would have you replaced before your obituary was in the newspapers. That is this place. Now that being said. There is some awesome employees and lower management there but that's all this warehouse has going for it. If it wasnt for my manager at the time I would of left a long time ago.
bad,They fired me right before the layoff to prevent from getting severance pay...the supervisor all kiss the directors butt...what they do for one person they want do for the next...its all about favortism.
bad,"Avoid at all cost. Lack or training, false information provided so, that the staff can fail. Turn over is extremely high. It give management an incentive to release staff and to offer lower pay for the next employee. Supervisors can pick and choose what policies they want to use. And, when corporate reprimands someone the supervisors will lie and upper management always believes them. This is a job for brown nosers. If you have any self dignity than you would avoid this place at all cost."
bad,Cost of living goes up but your pay doesn’t plus Insurance every year & it’s not affordable at all. You will have several supervisors. Almost impossible to move to CCR II. Which I’ve tried to do since I’ve been with the company. Still has not happened. Every supervisor I’ve had is/was aware how bad I wanted/needed this raise.
bad,"A very stressful environment with Management not caring at all about employees welfare.  Hires upper managers that do not know anything about medicines, just knows how to kick someone's blank!  I am so glad to be rid of this unbelievable work environment where pets could say what they wanted, do little and blame staff that works hard everyday.  Not for me or any adults.  Best part was helping clients and nurses who actually make sense.  I advise any Administrative/Reception applicant to look elsewhere and not believe the lies from upper management that this company is so wonderful.  Nothing but a few benefits at CVS was nice.  There are good places to work - DO NOT waste time!"
bad,Trash trash trash this job will make you hate yourself for even working here store managers cant handle her emotions or communicate with employees and the pharmacy is just as terrible
bad,"They cut my pay to work in orlando that has a higher cost of living than Manchester NH I was making 58 per hour and they dropped me down to 50. Said cheaper cost of living. Lies! The were paying new grads the same and I had 10 years experience. Nurse practitioners built minuteclinic and now CVS devalues them and uses them. Only good thing about minute clinic is patients need a service like this. NPs are the caregiver, office manager, janitor, biller and ma all in one and even with high patient satisfaction, clinic growth nd evidence based care they still took the opportunity to see me out of pay knowing I had to move."
bad,This company is a joke !!!  All they care about is squeezing every cent out of any situation !!! DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY !!! Nothing good will come
bad,Cvs does not care about the patients at all. They cut our hours and still expect perfect metrics. The pay for a state Certified technician is not appropriate for the amount of work we have to.do. All they do is add more work and you aren't properly paid for it. I will never work for cvs again.
bad,"No respect for the actual profession of pharmacy, they are focused on the pharmaceutical industry and the bottom line. Be prepared for the real possibility of working by yourself while covering everything: drive thru, drop off, input, fill and verification because god forbid you go over tech hours by having at least one tech scheduled."
bad,I worked with them for 3 months the pharmacist was rude to me and I was never paid for my work. It has been 3 years and was never paid for my 3 months of work
bad,"CVS dos not care about its employees, only the customers. They see employees as numbers and do not care about if you or your family member is sick.  they are not good people"
bad,"A typical day would include several projects. Executed accurately, BUT management and HR were not in Sync. This disconnect created a hostile work environment"
bad,"Terrible and traumatizing. The pay is not livable. The hours are inconsistent. You get overworked quickly with little, to no compensation for the extra work. You are treated poorly buy customers and not defended by management. One of my worst work experiences."
bad,"No one covers for anyone"
bad,"1. Special treatment is given to employees who gossip well with the Pharmacist In Charge (Pharmacy Manager)."
bad,Awful and the most toxic uncomfortable environment I have ever worked in. Would not recommend for any females or anyone looking  for a positive healthy job.
bad,"This company pays less than other similar ones and the management is terrible when it comes to communicating schedule changes, improvement in the workplace, and they don't value their employees."
bad,"We were told during the interview that we could pick our schedule and days off. During orientation they had us pick paper slips out of a box and said that's your schedule, you have 15 minutes to trade with each other for the schedule you want. Training seemed great until you got on the floor and realized it was worthless. Mandatory overtime. They said pick your overtime hours early and get them approved, then the schedule won't change. Put in for and got approval for my hours a month early, then they changed the hours. They wanted me for a dedicated team for a specific client, but I didn't want a different supervisor. They assured me I could stay on my team. First day of new training they said you have a new supervisor and you won't be dedicated to that specific client, but to the Medicare team. I walked out. Tired of being lied to by my boss about everything."
bad,I do not recommend cvs to work. As a pharmacy tech I never received proper training. Always big lines and not a place to learn. I came to CVS after graduation and didn’t learn anything else here.
bad,"They preach work/life balance, but do nothing to foster this."
bad,Hired me and several others only to lay us all off a few months later due to lack of hours. I’m on unemployment and cvs is trying to fight me on this because they don’t want to pay. Terrible company
bad,"Although I worked at cvs for 4 years, I felt as though in that 4 years I could’ve went farther with the company. I worked hard, was never late, rarely called in sick and when I did I always tried to find coverage. I did my job as well as trained others to do their job."
bad,"Very toxic environment.I left under my own accord.Very fast pace,but when an elderly lady starts shoving you at your workplace its time to go.No one should have to put up with physical abuse let alone her verbal abuse.Being a veteran of the AIR FORCE I deserve better as well as everybody else should."
bad,"healthcare cost is to high, overtime is terrible mandated every night more 6 day weeks than scheduled, overtime is not split evenly over both shifts, night shift gets the short end of the stick, over worked and underpaid, company constantly lies, supervisor lacks personality, cant have a life outside of the company they mandate overtime its not voluntary, pressure employees, favoritism, short breaks, no air in summer like working in an oven. Supervisor gives you a hassle if you try to use your earned time off."
bad,this job was extremely stressful for the pay. I didnt like this job at all. They would overwork you and didnt help you at all when asked. I think this is by far the worst company I work for and training was extremely bad didnt know anything
bad,Horrible company to work for.  You will be expected to do everything in the store on your own. There is only a cashier and manager to work each shift. Labor budgets are as tight as they can be. You constantly have to help out other stores or call for help. Forget about it if someone goes on vacation.  I could sit here and write a novel about the negative aspects of this company and how they run a business. STAY AWAY
bad,The passion of care of the good staff members is drowned in the overbearing corporate atmosphere.  I had no less than three managers in my short time at this location.  I would not recommend this place of employment to my worst enemies.
bad,You are paid minimum wage even if you have experience. No benefits and no option of being full time even if you work 30 or more hours a week. Poor management.
bad,"Worked at CVS for 5+years. The last couple years the company turned on their employees and customers Increasing work load and decreasing tech hours. Docked points if you don’t call a customers phone to notify them of an action note even if they’re standing right in front of you. The raises given are not worth all the stress and huge work load. Management sucks, if they don’t know how to do something they just don’t do it regardless of who it affects."
bad,"when I first started to work here I loved coming to work, but little by little that wasn't the case.  I started to not like coming to work when they changed mangers and thing went left one who loved coming and working got only 2 hours a week and life got really hard."
bad,"Yes it's a job, but you are treated like a dog. Spoken to as if you're a slave. Supervisors are incompetent to say the least. No norm to the job, they are constantly trying ""new"" things to get people to stay but the place sucks and they are in absolute denial about it. "
bad,"You don’t get to be a pharmacist here. They will burn you out and constantly increase the amount of menial tasks they want you to complete all the while cutting tech hours. No lunch, healthcare benefits are lacking, and management is on another planet."
bad,"No one really knows what they are doing there. Not much help. Special privileges for those they favor. For those they don’t, they will passive aggressively  do things to drive you insane. Mandatory OT. Some people have to do it while others don’t. Some people don’t come to work for months at a time and still have a job. They will error you frequently if you are not liked. Inappropriate conversations from employees all day long. Too much discussion and distraction around for a job that requires you to never make mistakes. Other departments are poorly trained and they constantly cold transfer, transfer to wrong department, never run their test claims, don’t know who they are transferring and why, it’s just a lot going on daily and you start out happy but by the end they don’t pay enough for all you deal with. Members are elderly and can’t hear most time your yelling, their phones lines are not good either, which may not help members who already can’t hear good anyways. Just all over the place. Most don’t stay here and I see why. I think it’s a good company and I thought it was gonna be my new home but if I can’t find another department I may sadly have to leave because the department I’m in is going downhill and no one cares. Fake phony snakes, so watch your back."
bad,They don’t care for the employees or patients. They only care for profits. Staff is overworked and under paid. Staff is also constantly under pressure to meet scores.
bad,"I cannot recommend that anyone work at CVS.  It is a HORRIBLE company to work for, if you value your sanity and peace of mind. There are too many things wrong with this company to even be able to go into detail in this review. Just do yourself a favor- be happy, and don't work for CVS."
bad,I dont really have that much to say about this Job as it is one that I would not recommend for anyone. This is said not to downplay the efficiency or brand which is CVS but just to simply say it is not a job I feel most people would want to work
bad,"I was hired 6 months ago, I was trained once a week for 3 hours for 6 weeks, after that they stopped training saying they didn't have time for training. They are very prejudice there an if you are not in their little click you are not accepted. When you would ask to help get more training they would brush you off and tell you later."
bad,"this is a company that is very good as far as organizational skills. "
bad,"Awful 6 yrs and when I quit I was at 8.68.  I started  at 7 dollars.  Every year you my get a dime raise . They say 10% bs. Absolutely awful,  you are trash and disrespected,  you don't get hours district managers are bologna not going over budget they get bouness  so do store managers,  so regular people get hiurs cut and no raises so the store comes in under budget and the store manager gets a bigger bouness."
bad,"This place is ridiculous. They will change your schedule 100 times at the last minute so that the managers and supervisors don't have to work. They make outrageous demands to make their job easier. People get hired and work one day then leave, the turnover rate is insane because this place is horrid."
bad,company unprofessional  I only had to work here cause I needed a job the Nashville office is a big joke honestly it is. so happy to say  I am no longer there
bad,I was a student working here and I just had a terrible manager. Lets just say he didn't know what he was doing. He expected you to magically know everything by your third day. To know how a PHARMACY WORKS in 3 days. IMPOSSIBLE! I found another job quickly and left that pharmacy to its demise.
bad,Managerment depends on supervisors to do there job while they take the day off. Low pay long hours. District manager lends no aid to the management team. Impossible to find hard working co workers. Impossible to fire a employee even if they are stealing.
bad,"i have worked with CVS for 5 years and can tell you its a bad place to work, the worst of retail infact. under pays its employees but also expects a ridiculous amount from you, just dont even go to walgreens or even publix is better"
bad,"from the time I started the job I had issues, son was sick hard to get off work, not very friendly place to work and the travil was rough with high traffic"
bad,CVS did not provide adequate staffing of pharmacist or technicians.  I was not able to take a 15 minute break or lunch break while working 12 hour shifts.  They required I go to mandatory meetings on my day of and not get compensated for it.
bad,"Management was the worse I have ever seen. This place did not care about anyone, you would have to work as many hours as they want you to. They made people come in on the weekends just about every other weekend."
bad,"This job is a joke...like most job this job makes you do all the work and then management gets all the credits plus with shady raise but mangement be pocking bonuses. Merwin/CVS tells all employee stating that they are on a budget but is short staff compare to the previous years. They tell you that you'll be working one day on a weekend out of the month now its 3 even to 4 weekends in a month. If you decided to work there good luck and if you see a dude always walking around doing nothing, he got it good. Better off working somewhere else then this place or if they get rid of front and back even the floor manager maybe this place be a better place to work for."
bad,Cvs  is a horrible company. There rules and procedures are never the same for each individual. It’s up to them as to what is considered ok at the time.
bad,"This review is about the same. CVS uses you to work longer, more, and pressed hours to meet their demands. Especially with 24 hours stores. The company doesn’t believe in cashier separate work from technician work. Overall a terrible company to work for that will throw you under the bus. Mind you they fired a really good pharmacist that hired me on. Brilliant man. Was “let go” from the company cause he fronted an employee some antibiotics that her kid threw in the trash until she could get the doctor to write a new script for the fill. After he got fired I left seeing how this company treats it pharmacy personnel that have been with them 10+ years. The whole mission an code with any of these companies is just something to look good and entice people that their care will be excellent here. It really depends on the crew and how your team works together. After that pharmacist, things turned for the worst before I transferred out. Most of these pharmacies are ran by sleep deprived under paid students."
bad,"Being a retail pharmacy technician is a challenge.  The management and culture of the specific pharmacy can make or break the job experience.  The specific location I worked at, had a very depressed feel.  Their turnover was/is VERY high, and they did not see that it was a problem.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the moments of actual customer service- helping people.  The most difficult part of the job was not being able to serve the customer at 100% reaction time, because management/corporate was too concerned about high overhead, costs, and ROI.  A typical day is on your feet, 100% of the time, racing to the telephone/drive-thru/fill station...just to make your 'time', and not on customer service."
bad,"Mental abuse from patients and the company. Absolutely awful job, have left crying more times than I can count. Technicians cry from the abuse from patients at least once a day and the company laughs in our face."
bad,"My experience with CVS Pharmacy, was they were very unprofessional on so many levels. I used all of their ""ethics lines, and counseling services"" to try to solve the issues to no avail. I QUIT!"
bad,"Strongly disappointed due to the manager in my store, I use to love and enjoy coming to work. Than we got a new negative manager who didn’t do anything but yell."
bad,Terrible place to work. they cut hours but expect lots from you. Because of the lack of help customers end up mad and yell at you a lot. Upper management is useless at best
bad,"I hated working at cvs, the company was disorganized. Their way of hiring was horrible. They were unprofessional to customers. They didn't train employees well."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, is all about the numbers and not patient care. They were more concern about the number of phone calls you make rather than taking care of customers."
bad,"Management treated workers awfully, pay is low, morale is low. Tell you 10 minutes before your shift ends that you have to stay 2 more hours. I still went into work when I had the Flu and Bronchitis at the same time and the manager still screamed at me because I was moving slower due to the fact that I was barely standing from being so sick."
bad,"never gave positive feed back to anyone"
bad,Poor management
bad,"the work place environment was great for years, as usual, once poor management took over the environment changed drastically. Everyones morale went down and going to work was a dreadful experience. The company does not care about its employees and its obvious in the way they are treated."
bad,"I've been an employee for 8 years. I used to love my work. Upper management used to back us. Not anymore. We get beaten down by customers and corporate alike. Our hours get cut continuously. And we're expected to do more work with less people and hours. If you work for them, prepare to get cursed at and blamed for everything under the sun, and then ripped from the other side for not making the customers demands. Even when they cannot be met rationally."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, one sided , upper management and supervisors are ghetto and incompetent and they only got that position because no one else wanted it not because the are smart, most of the colleagues are ghetto the were just hired without any background check because they just hire anything off the street. I wouldn’t recommend this job for anyone that is brilliant, has goals and wants to do better in life, The ceo needs to honestly come to his call centers to see how this incompetent managers and supervisors and colleagues are messing up his business instead of saving this patients lives, there’s a lot of undercover schemes going on"
bad,"Deliberate under-staffing to truly dangerous levels, with the strongest metric based on providing excellent customer service and efficiency despite perpetual decrease in help hours. Most pharmacists come in significantly early unpaid and stay late unpaid and do not eat or drink or use the bathroom, on a daily basis, for up to 15 hours per day some days. Company claims to provide breaks and to limit how many hours a pharmacist can work (laws vary from state to state) but impossible and humane working conditions force pharmacists to work around this by working off the clock just to survive. Daily reality."
bad,"This place is horrendous, they brag about being such a friendly workplace but when you actually meet their employees you find out how much of a lie that really is.  They treat the remaining employees like slaves, forcing them to work 12+ hours nightly AND forced weekend overtime. The obserdity doesnt stop there, no sir! The supervisors preach about how everyone has to follow the company rules then thumb their noses at them! The full case stocking supervisor was even committing vagrant conflicts of interest by banging several of her subordinates! And the upper management knew, nothing was done! They refuse to hire enough employees to fully staff the warehouse but yet continue to increase goals, alienating and forcing most of the leftover employees to suffer."
bad,"This employer has great ideas, however the execution of those ideas fall on the bottom employees who are overworked and under paid. Dealing with the usual stress of pharmacy atmosphere, plus the demands of the company management without enough help not only demoralized the employees, but ruins any good intentions the company wishes to convey to the company."
bad,"The worst place to work there. If you are part time, you will always be forced to work weekends while the full timers never have to. Ridiculous amount of work load and stress with no appreciation from the higher ups. People who are lazy and do not do their job are getting paid more than you. Bugs and mice in the pharmacy. Also, coworkers like to back talk ."
bad,"This company will drain the life out of you.  They have completely unrealistic expectations and do not provide the resources to accomplish tasks.  Your license will be on the line everyday!! Slave labor! Understaffed, overworked, unsafe computer systems, ineffective IT department-expect to spend at least 3 hours of your time on the phone with IT in your first month, and there is no sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. "
bad,The pharmacy in Clinton South Carolina shows favoritism and not a good place to work.  The hourly pay was terrible.  I was there 5 years I only got 2 raises.
bad,Got harassed by supervisor the whole time I worked there for two years and reported it and nothing was done then tried to finally stand up for myself cause I got fed up and was put on suspension for a month and a half then got let go because I stood up for myself and then they tried to falsely accuse me of things and tried to get me to agree to something I was not guilty of and now they won't pay me for my vacation time I had at time of separation.
bad,"CVS is a HORRIBLE place to work.  They give incredibly small raises, if you are part time your schedule gets moved around a lot, plus they sometimes only give 10 or 12 hours a week.  Also there discount is a joke compared to the discount Longs Drugs gave to their employees. I wish Longs Drugs had never sold out to CVS Pharmacy."
bad,from day 1 I knew this job was not for me . . . I stayed to see if things changed . . . almost 3 years later I wasted a lot of time and it gave me hella anxiety and depression working at this place and environment
bad,"very disappointed, management was very rude, no respect for employees' rights, understaffed because everyone kept quitting which made it even more stressful for those that stayed"
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job were the patients they were always kind and it made you love what you do! but working for CVS was very stressful all employees complained on certain supervisors who always did favoritism with certain employees...certain supervisors would send you emails on why you were at the restroom for more than 3 minutes...they even went as far as sending out emails to the whole site on if you go more than 10 min a week you will get a write up....They would talk to you rude like you were a child and even before I got wrote up by my sup because of my child school called them for an emergency and i had to go to the hospital and the next day i got wrote up for leaving early....raises would be 12 cents...they top manager would be on all sups side for all reasons...you were not allowed to talk to other employees walking by your desk...the hardest part of the job was when the sups would make you lie to patients about their medication, I felt sorry and bad sometimes....after about 4 years with CVS i still was at $15/hr and they even had you training people without pay when we had a on site trainer. MICRO MANAGEMENT is what CVS is and very UNFAIR...at the end of the day you should be happy to go into work and love your job. they make you feel opposite...I seen many employees go on stress leave, cry in the restrooms, walk right out and just quit all because of how they treat you."
bad,"Pharmacists get less and less technician help and more and more is demanded from them year after year."
bad,This is the worst organization to work for or be a patient depending on receiving life saving medications.  Patient's wait forever to get their medications because of lack of organization.  They can not keep educated an caring employees.
bad,"The benefits are terrible. For a so-called health care company, their health benefits are very poor. The worst I ever had. Culture in CVS is bad. It is a culture of fear and not respect or collaboration. Management treats you badly and is very condescending. Work-life balance does not exist. Very stressful. Company may have a nice image on the outside, but once you are in, you will quickly see that they do not care for employees or customers at all. It's all about profit to them."
bad,After over 20 years at CVS I cannot say that the company has turned in a good direction. Why I believe the people in corporate do not have a good realization of everything that goes on because when they visit places everyone is made to clean up and make sure it looks like everyone works in a clean calm atmosphere. Our upper management should do poppin visits and actually talk to the people that work in the areas then they would get a true picture of what actually takes place and the hoops we have to jump through to make management happy. I am tired of hearing we are  A team but yet the bottom person is the one that gets the downfall if stuff goes wrong. The you own it or we own it is definitely a myth.
bad,"Always a busy work environment because usually, it is understaffed. I did learn a lot about how to work with patients and explain  to them about how long they have to wait for their medications to get ready."
bad,They hire kids and they become kid managers who have no clue how to manage people. It is difficult to receive a promotion even with a degree. They very seldom move people into upper management positions with degrees.
bad,"If you’re good at kissing up to management then this is a job for you!! If you show initiative, work OT when needed, have excellent attendance, actually talk to your patients with respect and a caring attitude, DO NOT waste your time!! All that management cares about is how many calls you take an hour, not the quality of the calls. Corporate at its best! Training is awesome, but once you’re on the floor it’s cutthroat. Supervisors are not willing to help, they leave it to team leads, which go above and beyond, and get treated like awful. They base your intire review on quantity not quality. Don’t waste your time!!"
bad,All the management are complete idiots they train you wrong and it cause you to get fired and the sad thing is all of them was doing the same thing I will never work for them ever or even shop there again I use to love going in there until I started working there I seen how they treated their employees and talked about their customers.
bad,"CVS Coram in Norwood, MA "
bad,"Employees are not valued / poor conditions / "
bad,"A typical day is trying to get all of the orders out and most of the time that doesn't happen because we do not have enough employees to get the job done. With this issue, the company doesn't seem to be looking for any new hires."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. They take on too many customers with too little staffing. The companies expectations are unrealistic. I would not recommend.
bad,You put your life into your store to make your customers and employees happy and then when you get hurt at work they don't help you . They are taking so long on getting you to see a doctor I will probably be permanently disabled due to them .
bad,"Do not work at CVS Health. Terrible culture. No career path, no potential for growth. Too much politics. Crazy workload. Senior Management has no integrity."
bad,"I was working full time there and going to school part time.  Despite telling my boss that I could only work certain days and hours, he did his own schedule.  I had to fight to get certain nights off so that I could go to school.  One time when I was really sick, rather than let me go home, he made me stay.  It wasn't until he left where another manager let me go home.  I had to go to the doctor's just to get a note to get excused for the rest of the week so that i could get bette."
bad,Summary says it all.  Company only cares about money.  Any benefits they say are for the good of the employees or patients are secretly geared to drive profits.  Run away as fast as you can.
bad,"I did not like working for this company. You were overworked and underpaid, you were required to wear many hats whether you wanted to or not to keep the job moving along. Management was very unfair."
bad,"This job was decent, the manager and other workers refused to give me the proper time I needed when doing my learning mods on the computer, it was always hurry hurry get them done so you can start working even when I was just supposed to be clocked in to learn on the computer about my job."
bad,Would never recommend to anyone...I have been with the company for over 20 years at the same store and planning to work until I retire. Then they decide to fire me for a policy and procedure violation that has never been uniformly enforced with no warning!!! They can get rid of anyone they desire for pretty much no good reason whenever they want!!!
bad,if they don’t like you they get rid of you without any reason. the pay is horrible and most of the pharmacists don’t care about the customers health. they are dirty.
bad,This isn’t a company you would want to work for. They don’t care about their employees.. only the assets of the company.. everyday i come to work and had to fight that thieves. And LP said the stealing was lnternal when people walk out with trash bags full of stuff long story short they let me go for telling a shoplifter get out the store
bad,".Work like crazy, understaffed, underpaid and expect to be required to smile. I learned that customers are always right in the eyes of CVS regardless of circumstance. One positive is other techs."
bad,"I can't stand it here anymore. It use to not be that bad but now... CVS doesn't care the slightest for their employees. They will do everything to keep you in a tube. They are horrid, awful people with nothing better to do then play the same 90 songs every gosh darn day... DO NOT WORK FOR ANY CVS I BEG YOU. less than 50 cent raises every year, coups that don't work 90% of the time and you can't figure out why, management throwing away things that HELP front desk people who have to work in the back, never enough people to get a days worth of work done, having to WASTE so much paper cause CVS loves that, CVS telling you to make the customers happy no matter what then giving you no way on how to possibly do that, changes up the coupon rules without telling you, and does early activation which MESSES EVERYTHING UP"
bad,"Do your research. Ask many questions, do not assume, they will only reveal certain pieces of information. For a company this large, it's health insurance is horrible, and you are expected to learn it on your own, no one from company to conduct classes on understanding any of their benefits."
bad,Cvs will make you think they own you. The company will do everything it can to make a dollar including throwing someone under the bus for what they did not do. You could not pay me enought to work here again.
bad,Not worth my time to do such. A waste of time and energy and this review is totally unnecessary and again wasting my time and energy discussing it or writing bout them.
bad,"Slave driven job, long hours, nasty customers, equipment breaks all the time, managers are constantly looking for mistakes and never say a good thing about accomplishments. Salary is very low. Not worth working there at all. Horrible place to work at"
bad,Techs always leave and the ones there have to carry the burden of not enough people to do the work. You can just see that nobody wants to work for CVS.
bad,The job is based on nothing but favoritism and gossip. If you don’t kiss the managers behind you don’t get hours. Management is all over the place and unprofessional. If I would’ve known this job would be such a burden I wouldn’t have accepted the offer.
bad,I have never worked for CVS- the company I worked for was Omnicare-the experience there was not a positive experience- management very difficult to work with
bad,"They continually disrespect boundaries and schedule you for times you are not available.  They are a revolving door.  No one wants to stay working for them because we are all burnt out.  Management is incompetent and routinely try to pit supervisors against lower employees.  We are a team, not out to get each other."
bad,rude staff; rude clients; fast pace; not willing to train; sink or swim; no lunch break; I left work twice in tears; i quit and I have never quit anything
bad,"My CVS management team did not take a vested interest in my success at CVS.  I was there for 12 years, making only .40 more than the new tech that was hired last week."
bad,"Run and gun nonsense, understaffed. Zero frame work or training. Turn and burn also incorporated with lies. Management brags how they worked service desk and now they have climbed the corporate ladder to their current position  6 to 8 times per week."
bad,"I went to the job fair, and I felt like a sheep in a herd. I didn’t even really get a real interview. A month later I was hired. It took another month to process my background check and drug test. "
bad,They had unrealistic expectations for us. I left the store so many times with 99+prescriptions still needing to be filled. I found myself running around the pharmacy trying to make some sort of dent in the work load.
bad,"After working with the company through many changes, it has gotten to be the worst work environment I have seen in the decades that I worked here....."
bad,"CVS is a company that works their employees like slaves. They either try to overwork all of you or not work you at all. My time here was THE worst years of my entire life. The customers were rude with an exception of about 10/1000. I was employed there for 3 years and had about 4 different pharmacy managers. It was THE ABSOLUTE WORSE. The last manager I had was a young guy with a huge ego! One day I had enough and put in my two weeks noticed, however I was placed in the corporate system as being ""terminated"". They treated me terribly upon my departure and I would rater die than ever go back."
bad,"Enjoyed working here. Self paced. You get your own computer that you share with the next shift, calls are consistent. Paid training. You have to start at afternoon shifts."
bad,"There’s much better opportunities out there folks."
bad,"The worst management you could ever ask for. HR doesn't care about anything, period. I could go on and on. Do not do it, you'll regret it. It is absolutely miserable."
bad,This is a company that has absolutely no vision and doesn't care about their employees at all. Stores doesn't have bare minimum labor hours to operate. If you are a management employee you will spend more than 12 hours a day 7 days a week just to keep the store running.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"filled scripts,data entry and assisted customers.  the hardest part about my job was if you were not in he click you did not get the hours.  the most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers."
bad,Working hard and never got acknowledged about work ethics lazy staff depending on one person to do everything uncleanliness rude staff tardiness if you sneeze they will fire you break room was disgusting next to the employee bathroom customers were allowed to use the employee bathroom the lead tech was selfish hardly taught the other pharmacy techs anything modules were to be completed every other day we hardly had time because our store was so busy
bad,"They work you hard, pay you little, and expect the world from you. Don't have a life because they don't care despite having care in their name. The environment is cut throat. If you aren't in a clique you aren't relevant"
bad,"Management at that particular store was seriously lacking.  Benefits were lacking.  They say they hire from within, but you cannot cross the retail side to corporate side.  Very difficult."
bad,"I DONOT recommend CVS at all , it's so stressful . too much to do , usually short staffed , cutting hrs , low salaries , least benefits , nobody cares about employee satisfaction or improvement , nor career development ,minimal training  . district managers do not respond to emails/texts ."
bad,"Working for CVS Caremark was possibly the most stressful work environment that I have ever worked in. The metrics that you have to meet is unreasonable at best. The worst part of the job was a tie between management and the type of calls you take. Management cared very little for your success and even less about helping you keep your job."
bad,"Never work for this greedy company. I mean never, never, never. Bunch of non-pharmacists rule over pharmacy staff. These guys never worked in pharmacy so all knowledge they have is theoretical, no experience. But they converse as if they had 50-year worth of experience. No counseling, no time to verify scripts with focuse, enslavery is rampant, very shady policies, adds responsibilities each week with decreasing help, very hazardous conditions that for instance resulted in dispensing of zolpidem instead of Xarelto for fresh CABG patient, the list goes on. All in all, never ever ever ever work for this company."
bad,"I’d rather die than work at cvs pharmacy. They don’t care about their employees. All the managers want is to follow to “customer care” guidelines that contradict what the customers want. So when you please the customer, you actually go against the customer care protocol so you get yelled at for now following a stupid guideline that the customers think is stupid. I also got paid $9.50 per hour while the new hires that I was training started off with $14 per hour"
bad,I was sadly disappointed in this company. They were really disorganized and pharmacist were extremely mean. I dreaded every day of work and dont recommend this placde
bad,Women are not treated respectively and valued in this company. The top management does treat the employees with consideration. They have no regard for anyone outside of being a district or regional manager. They view the customers as dollars not as actually people.I hope this environment will changed because it's a horrible place to work.
bad,"I'm a pretty hardworking person, and it was still never enough. The pharmacist we're very unprofessional. The only pharmacists that actually cared we're the young ones barely starting their career. Not ageist at all, just worked at many pharmacies across las vegas and that's what showed. Overall don't work here you can find way better, especially if you're already certified."
bad,No raise after promised 1 year. Made to work EVERY holiday. No flexibility in hours. Cant schedule a vacation 6 months in advance. Poor Management. Promises made but unkept.
bad,"The paid training is bootcamp. They instruct you once and dont like questions. There is so much to learn in 5 days of training and if you dont have experience in call centers you will be lost in no time. The floor support yells at you and belittles you. you are required to account for every second of your day, they time you on bathroom breaks."
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy technician for 3 years, got nationally certified, promoted to Inventory Specialist and Immunization Specialist, and never once received a raise. The company kept cutting hours and demanding better results, but refused to give us any of the tools we needed to perform our jobs. We contacted the district manager, the regional manager, wrote letters and reviews asking for help and received nothing. CVS doesn't care about its employees and expects us to do more than our fair share of work, but won't compensate for it. If you have the option to work anywhere else, do so. There is a reason people are feeling the company in droves."
bad,"●	Accurately enter and maintain prescription data using computer system"
bad,totally dissatisfied. all the money stays in corporate hands instead of coming back to people who are killing themselves daily to bring it to them. How unfair that a company which has so much gives so little. the culture will not change until a total shake down at the very top occurs
bad,They say they don’t tolerated retaliation but that’s totally not true. When security is needed in the store due to high theft and threats being made by shoplifters they tend to not care and brush it off. Especially when only 2 females are working alone til closing time.
bad,"Not enough training with the job, too much work for so little pay and training. It's all about numbers here, very stressful work environment. Customers are never happy or satisfied, need to update their technology and automated call system causes so many problems."
bad,"CVS has been herding people through it's system for years. Asking a lot for not a lot of money or perks. Working here made me wonder ""is this what prison is like?""."
bad,"8 hr day, floor supervisors were awesome but management was not helpful at all. Was not given any notice of being let go. They wait till you work a full day then wait till you leave and immediately send out an email that you no longer have a job. You are not able to go back in to retrieve your belongings. I did enjoy my fellow employees and floor supervisors."
bad,Unorganized. Most management unable to do their jobs the way they should be able Poor leadership. Unfair pay rates. Inconstant hours and goals. Would not recommend to anyone looking for any kind of work.
bad,poor company job description does not dercribe your actual description once hired.No consistent training some days I would come to work sit at desk with nothing to do because the person who was in charge of training was learning a new job and training someone else. Everyone went not vacation at the same time during my six weeks there before I quick.My 4th week I was changed to a different job responsibility and desk moved.Other employyes knew changes regaurding before I did. Poor poor management . There was no common sense while I was working there. should definitely get paid more than 12.00 for job responsibility
bad,Managment was extremely uncompliant with my needs being pregnant. Wasn't allowed to use the restroom or sit as needed. Treated very poorly. Horrible corporate response to complaints. Was forced to quit because I wasn't allowed to transfer to a more caring store.
bad,"The pay is not competitive, turnover is a huge problem, and they cut back on hours constantly while demanding that more work be done. They are rarely staffed adequately."
bad,Did not like the company.  Managers did not pitch in and work when others were out sick; hated the entire experience; will not recommend it to others;
bad,Management is awful. They have their clicks within the company and only support and promote those they like.  If you are not one of them then you will not get promoted are receive any assistance.  The pay is awful in the PBM side while retail gets the good pay and bonuses.  PBM is the step child of CVS.
bad,"I worked there and was also a foster parent at the time. I had court the Monday after a holiday and they refused to let me have the day off. I worked very hard and I had even went to different stores and worked, but there is no reason in refusing someone who is trying to take care of God's children!"
bad,"This company takes advantage of their workforce, especially in “right to work” states."
bad,"Upper management only cares about numbers, they also pick and choose who can get away with what. Allowed a person to continue working while intoxicated. Also allowed a person to record fellow employee, completely against HIPPA laws."
bad,"This was a job I had as a teenager before I decided I wanted to go into the healthcare field and it was horrible. The management was awful, we worked over time that we weren't paid for. The list goes on."
bad,"Good company horrible management team, Hr or district managers dont handle issues. Very rude and disrespectful to employees and customers. Mangers dont do anything about comments, write up people for any little reason"
bad,"I worked for this company for nine months and was given nothing that they promised.  At times management acted childish and did not want to deal with any issues going on in the work area.  They do not properly train employees, you kind of have to figure things out on your own.  The people placed in leadership roles are not qualified to do the job. This place is micromanagement at its finest.  I would not send anyone that I know to work for Omnicare/CVS.  This place is the pits!"
bad,The Pharmacy manager was over worked and understaffed and unable to offer reasonable schedules which caused us to be overworked and burnt out. It was a really bad environment.
bad,CVS does not value their employees on any level. Revenue is their only concern. You will not be supported. You will be overworked and underpaid. Dont do it. I am currently seeking other employment actively. Im not allowing them to mistreat me any longer.
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, and set up to fail. CVS is literally the bottom of the barrel for any pharmacist worth their weight. If you want a means to an end and have no problems leaving your work at the door then go ahead, apply for CVS. But if you have any aspirations to be anything other than a monkey matching the pictures on verification to the medicines in your hand, I would avoid this company; they will bleed you dry."
bad,They make sure that everything you do is taught over loooong lengths of time. There is no back up. Half the staff you need and never any motivation. I was disappointed. I looked forward to this career and was denied the ability to grow.
bad,"The job requires work until 7 but would not leave until 9. I would over hear ""leadership"" talk about me. When I reported it nothing was done. I was trained by a lady who was rude, hateful and very discouraging, to my surprise nothing was done about that also"
bad,"Pays horribly, and doesn't offer much room for growth. I am not sure how all the people manage to stay there for so long being so overworked and understaffed."
bad,"I didn’t like working for this place at all because the manager always had an attitude, and this job was definitely not a future or career searching job, if you like greeting and being at a cash register this job would be perfect for you."
bad,C.V.S is a bad choice for a job. managers are poorly trained and don't know anything..people there are quick to throw anyone under the bus. wasted 4 and a half yrs and nothing to show for it.
bad,Cut throat employees. Bosses wfh. No advancement. Do not recommend.favortism.really a  poor excuse of a company.high standard quotas.  Walk on egg shells cause leads. Tattle tell and bosses like to fire. Scream. This company is all about pharmacist. You are only responded to by your pay rank. This place will never change for the better
bad,"-Pretty abusive with those who work hard, in my case they had me on tuesdays from 2pm to 5am, with only one break. Employees were lazy or stealing product."
bad,"I was a Pharmacy Technician at Omnicare Pharmacy not CVS Pharmacy. "
bad,"Worst company to work for . Long hours low pay , don’t protect their employees . If you want to work as slave this is the best place .Worst company , worst management team"
bad,CVS was a good company to work for when I first started many years ago. Many things became micromanaged and responsibilities increased while hours were taken away. It became more and more difficult to remain working for a company where I did not feel respected by management.
bad,"If you like a job with so-so benefits, little recognition, extremely high call volume, then CVS call center would be right for you."
bad,"do not deserve a review That Bad"
bad,"Not only do they cut staff needed to perform the unimaginable amount of tasks that need to be done by the end of the day in half, they penalize you for not completing said tasks and cut hours even more. Most days my pharmacist and I would work a full day, close the pharmacy and come back after a half an hour and work until 3-4am just to try and clean up and do it all over the next day. Our store closed at 9pm. Management would send a ""clean up crew"" to help us clean out the over 600 rxs that were red and the weeks worth of totes lying around that no one had time to put away because we consistently had a line of angry customers glaring at us all the way down the isle. Don't even ask about the doctors calls or cycle counts! Not only were we drastically underpaid for what we had to bleed, sweat and cry over on a daily basis, but we were also the ones on the front lines that got verbally abused by all of our angry customers because their rx wasn't ready when the automated system said it would be.I worked there for 10 years and I don't know how I survived it. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"If you are part of the status quo you will do well, if you are part of the minority you will be challenged. I never missed a day, did my work and still was lied on by staff."
bad,"When you see CVS, run away. Unless you don't have any other opportunities, don't work for this company. Horrible culture, pressured employees and they only treat you like a number not a human being. Take my advice and run away from this horrible place."
bad,do not ever work at a cvs if you have the chance deny it. there is no eason you cant find a better job trust me don't do it to yourself they don't care about you.
bad,"stressful , management didnt care about the production process , no team work , no benefits , part time , less than 20 hours a week. Poor customer service"
bad,Working at CVS was a job for me when I was in high school. I don't recommend an adult with a family and kids to feed because you will be hard up for cash.
bad,CVS not a pleasant place to work.   The truth for employee duties and expectations changed constantly.  Trying to get a straight answer from Management was impossible.  Infraction descriptions were ridiculous.
bad,"CVS starts out at a flat hourly rate, no matter how much experience you have.  Managers are constantly away from their desk, whether there gossiping with others, in meetings that doesn't help their employees with advancement, etc.  Managers have little to no professionalism.  They communicate with others poorly.  I requested time off and was told I would be paid and it was never entered into my time card.  I told my Director and the Manager advised they never informed me I would be paid, even though I have proof from my email."
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. No appreciation at all for its employees. The management was terrible and the people they hired never stayed longer than a few weeks to maybe a few months.
bad,"CVS pharmacy was not very fair nor did they take the time to train employees. Most was computer based learning rather than hands on And the little hands on training you got was self taught, basically"
bad,"A typical work day is very stressful. We are timed do everything from, typing and filling prescriptions and to ringing up customers. The stores are understaffed and employees get penalized for not completing daily task such as return to stock and patient care calls along with filling prescriptions and ensuring every customer is rang up immediately. There are weekly conference calls where our boss threatens our job for low scores on customer satisfaction, completing each task before its due, and scanning customers extra care cards at the register. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I didn’t fit in, and they made it perfectly clear. Their numbers system is flawed. If the RPh doesn’t scan the different tech, the proper tech doesn’t get their numbers."
bad,The company cuts hours every year leaving it's employees nearly dying of starvation and resources possibly.  The company does not consider previous employment when advancing employees.  This company doesn't even consider education when promoting it's employees.  The company is very hesitant to give it's supervisors and employees rest and time to eat.  I did not enjoy my experience with the company but I loved the kind of work that I was doing and I loved the dear sweet customers.  If the company treated it's employees better this would be an ideal job.
bad,"Nothing but lies and false promises. They don't promote from within, and if they do, its the wrong people who suck up. Never got the training I was supposed to get according to company policies, just got stuck at checkout 90 percent of the time. They make and break rules when it's convenient. My hours were cut more than others. Health insurance goes up if you dont get a checkup at their minute clinic which was never disclosed up front but found out later. Store managers are passive agressive and like to post notes instead of talking to everyone (weak). Best thing I ever did there was walk out."
bad,"If you want to be an entry-level staff or a complete ""yes man,"" then this is the company for you. If you have a brain, your own opinions, ideas about how to practice pharmacy or you are a middle-management (i.e. PIC or GM) and are OK being the scapegoat/fall-guy, then this is the company for you. This is not a place for advancement and innovation from the ""line staff"" is shunned - only those who are ignorant to the processes push down the decree of the day."
bad,"The atmosphere was one of fear of reprisal for any mistakes and a few employees were obvious favorites, given work from home time and promotions that were not earned. I felt I had earned consideration for a promotion and was, instead, written up.It was horrible. and getting worse as time went on.It seriously affected my health and I left there in an emergency health situation. But glad to be out of there nonetheless. I truly felt bad for my fellow team members who were still there."
bad,They do not do anything they promised as far as moving forward in the company such as pay for certification tests and/or promote from with in the company.
bad,"Company lacks loyalty to employees."
bad,I have no words to describe this place that is good. The pay is horrible management or lack there of. It was like working at a high school if you are not part of the click then you are noone
bad,They do not accommodate for employees and the hr always messes up with pay and do not want their employees to grow with the company. This company could be better if showed support for the people that put in work for the company.
bad,Pay is minimum hours are minimum and stressful environment cooperate doesn’t follow up with issues that are dealt with. The only positive is the amount of vacation.
bad,"Hired at ""full time"" but never received enough hours for health benefits."
bad,I did not like working with company. The management  and leader skills were not qualified for employees.  No recognition and employees were not happy.
bad,In the beginning I really enjoyed this job. I learned many new skills and was eager to take in all the information. When I got a new manager that quickly changed. The whole atmosphere shifted from professional to this petty high school everyday drama. The customers were great and the job itself would've been enjoyable; if it wasn't for the new management.
bad,Stressful and unrewarding. Poorly managed and the company is too concerned with profit to provide proper staffing. Also 30 minute meal periods can result in poor eating habits and digestive issues.
bad,"I hate Retail and I would never go back to it. CVS is probably going out of business, that's why they barely have anyone working there. I was getting yelled at everyday for the lack of help we had in the store."
bad,I loved it!! I would love to work there again if I had received my license! it was hard at time but slow paced at others it just depended on the day but over all it was a amazing experience!
bad,"They work you to death, expectations are unrealistic and they write you up for stupid stuff. Also, they talk down to you. Absolutely zero job security, young punk with a big head and foul mouth trying to be Supervisor."
bad,"CVS Health views its employees as numbers. Worked more than 40 hours a week but was never given full-time benefits. In addition, always worked beyond 8 hours with minimal-to-no breaks. Work culture is abysmal and is mutually felt by all my colleagues and the pharmacy staff. Management is incompetent and does not listen to our needs."
bad,"Salaried positions are not recommended. They overwork their employees to all hours of the night (or even the entire day and overnight as well, also during vacation, or Paid Time Off). Above excellent employees have quit due to the lack of work/life balance which should not be the case for such a monstrous corporation. The same complaints worsened even after the merge with CVS several years ago."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers, especially my elderly neighbors. I enjoyed taking the time to assist in educating customers of all the benefits coupons and sales have to offer which made them want to return to the store more frequently to utilize company coupons. Giving great customer service made people happy to return and made me feel like I did some good for my community. Very fulfilling to help young and old the same."
bad,I`m so glad I don`t work for CVS anymore. It`s the worse company when it comes to treating employees. It`s like the big fish eats the small one. Managers are terrible.
bad,I was originally excited to work for CVS because my first impression I perceived that they were healthcare over business. Over the course of a year I've learned that priorities are skewed and employees are at risk for unfair treatment regardless of union influence. Not all stores are corrupt but as I mentioned priorities do not rank the same as you follow the ladder upwards.
bad,company going downhill  do not care one bit about employees  constant back stabbing mgmt causes everyone to throw everyone under bus to help themselves  enough stress to kill you if you stay too long!
bad,"Management is very poor across the board, the company itself is very manipulative. In my two years of working here, I have felt my mental health change drastically."
bad,poor management. Lots of gossiping about employees. It's a dog eat dog mentality...You'd better be able to turn your head to all the gossiping and throwing people under the bus....Of coarse everything that goes wrong in the store is owned by the new kid in the pharmacy...Too much hostility for my taste.
bad,"Lots of work, on feet all day, requires a lot of knowledge about insurance and drug names and uses, very poor upper management, no work life balance because hours change all the time, works holidays, weekends, nights, always promising things that NEVER happen."
bad,"Poor training, you basically have to learn everything on your own. The management is very poor. Although the environment and teamwork was poor the customers were the most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"They don't care about there workers just the money"
bad,"Culture promoted a lack of work ethic, need for the bottom line and was unprofessional. In regard to pharmacy practice, the company skirted the line between technician and pharmacist roles and what could be deemed by the board of pharmacy as practicing outside the scope of practice for a technician. too many meetings and would even be timed and limited to 3 minutes to go to the bathroom if you were off the phones."
bad,"the pharmacy was very demanding and some of the pharmacists would have bad attitudes, it was a very stressful job and the customers were always always rude"
bad,"Bad management "
bad,I uave worked there for 7 almost 8 years being the only person left after mass turn around over the years. The pharmacy started out with customers being #1 priority now they dont even care to learn the customers name its all about the numbers to make the Corparate lool good.thats not what i do im here to build a relationship with customers to earn the trust and respect so the come back to me not to treat them as another rx
bad,"Poor management,  poor pay, and incredibly high work load and responsibilities. People were surprised when I came back from break my first day. That was a sign to get out. I put up with it for 3 months and quit. Within a week I had a job that pays more than the supervisors there make and the people that have been there for 7 years. Enough said..........."
bad,Most stressful place I have ever worked!!! I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to work here. Stay away from this place. Worst job EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,I would not recommend this job for anyone who wants to advance in a career. Nor do I recommend this due to the rude customers and such. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the worst customers.
bad,"CVS used to be a place that was fun to work, cared about their customers and provided excellent customer service. Now that it is a big corporation it is numbers driven and less focused on employees or customers."
bad,"Horrible raises, horrible environment,  They will do anything they can to save a buck and will work a pharmacy so shorthanded that at times there will be nobody available to even count prescriptions."
bad,Always getting yelled at by customers for not having anything in stock due to lack of budget. Lack of raises or promotional opportunity. Lack of available hours due to budget.
bad,"Awful place to work lots of Closet RACIST, if you are not liked by your Supervisor God help you they conspire against you find ways to get rid of you. This is the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"From a store management perspective, look elsewhere. Company is completely unrealistic. It's certain things that must be done that really push the store backwards since there is close to no payroll, like seasonal transitions. Basically you're continually drowning and corporate policies throw you a brick for your troubles."
bad,"Typically busy learned not much to many Managers and Store Manager is the worst i ever worked for not Approachable and does not care about employees too much gossip and backstabbing"
bad,this job was temporary. This was the least friendly place i worked. Everyone stayed to themselves. co-workers were antisocial. Best thing about this job is they have a cafeteria on site that sells several different types of food so you always have an option
bad,"Did not have the right amount of resources for the amount of work. Call volume too high, pay too low. They asked to much for the amount of pay, and management was horrendous in their demeanor."
bad,"If there is a company that treats their employees worse, then I have yet to encounter them!  People are placed in MGMT positions based on open availability, not actual work ethic!  They base your value on how much of a suck up that you are!  Not your productivity!  They would give me a full time schedule without actually making me a full time employee to avoid paying me more!  And to deny me certain benefits!  They are an absolute joke!"
bad,Terrible experience with this company and the pay is terrible. Very unorganized and superiors are not knowledgeable. Wouldn't recommended this company to anyone.
bad,"life sucking "
bad,"Worst job i had so far. Promote too much and do not follow through.  This company is all about numbers and money. All they want is more customers and filled script, which is $$$"
bad,"The Finance Center Callcenter manager was extremely unprofessional and spoke poorly and negatively often about staff even to newcomers and temporaries,"
bad,"The employees don't stay very long thanks to the customers the frequent the store and cause trouble over things that they should have done before coming to the pharmacy, plus the lack of rspect shown."
bad,"Only one thing I can say,every cvs store or manager i worked with,their whole family or at least one family member work their ,who always act more than manager.CVS managers hired only their family or community ,feels like store are franchise than corporate.I hope many got the message.Same apply for district to regional management.Hire your country people only.Restwho cares.Also very disrespectful hr district managers."
bad,The working environment is very fast paced.  The culture of the workplace is very interactive.  I met a lot of great people.  The hardest part of the job is the high technician turnover rate.
bad,"The working culture at CVS is atrocious.  From favoritism to poor and worthless management, to the overall negative culture, this company is absolutely terrible.  The pharmacy is perpetually dirty, and there is absolutely no time to clean it up, as we don't have enough staff scheduled to get the basic customer service and prescription processing done, let alone any side work (such as inventory)."
bad,"Profit margins is the only goal of this company.  Hours will be cut, more workload will be put on employees, and new workers will not be hired.  Upper management has no idea what they are doing."
bad,"horrible job, so much the company expect from you for so little help"
bad,The hours in the pharmacy are variable. It really takes a great staff to make the day to day worth it. The customers are all rude and seldom do you have someone that thanks you for your work. There are no pay incentives being that each year they give you a $.10 raise. There is no room for advancement beyond a lead technician level. The salary cap is $16 an hour and not public knowledge. Nobody ever reaches that salary cap due to the fact that you'll most likely quit.
bad,A typical day at this job is very stressful and not compensated well at all for all the things an employee does there. They are always on budget for part time employees and barely hire full time employees.
bad,"Poor district manager with racist thinking. The previous district manager works well with minorities, but new district manager, she looked down on us as subclass citizen"
bad,"This was by far the worst decision of my life. The management was entitled, they were cut-throat, they didnt want to do their own jobs, and they were lazy and rude to customers. The only goood thing about this job was walking out the door to go home. In my short time they had 5 employees leave."
bad,CVS has treated me as replaceable since I got hired.  They have not worked with my schedule in any way and they feel like I can work off the clock and not get paid for the hours I put in.
bad,"they are not proactive,racist,unfair,bias,and retaliate when complained on. they are not fair and will not promote within even with have the credentials"
bad,Too much stress for so little pay and putting more responsibilities on the pharmacy technician and not increasing the pay.  Management gives the technician that they like pay increase and those they do not like evaluate them very poorly. Management does not rotate the technicians to give other technicians the opportunity learn other positions or to improve their skills.
bad,"I fell the mangement was not fair to the contract workers. To many inconsisties."
bad,"Responsibilities included checking out prescriptions, answering telephone inquiries, and pharmacist referrals. Focused on the customer service and prescription ordering process, as well as problem resolution and inventory management."
bad,"Upon employment for CVS, I was told they would train me to get the certification I needed to be a pharmacy tech.  They only trained me on the CVS way of filling orders and did not teach anything that was on the test.  Very disappointed"
bad,"I had respect for this company. When it comes down to it they are unorganized, no proper training. It is a very frustrating company to work for when you try your hardest to do what is expected of you and it is frowned upon. It is a great company to get some experience under your belt but it is not a career company unless you know ""somebody"""
bad,"If you ever want to work in a place where your employers treat you worse than the customers do. Than this is your place, the company is open 365 days, they do not care if you are sick, its snowing, your family member died, or even if its Christmas. They will work you to death pay you the bare minimum and then mail the customer coupons who complain about you as an employee because you couldn't use their coupon that expired 5 years prior to the current date."
bad,"Do not work there, worst place I have ever worked at. I never enjoy going to work.Management could never be satisfied with the job you was doing. Everybody would cut your throat to get ahead. Other employees did not care for customer and would not help them. When you would complain about hours scheduled then they would cut your hours the next week."
bad,Run from this company.  You will just be a number.  Horrible work culture from senior managers.  Low pay.  Horrible benefits and zero appreciation.  Work 11 hours and no breaks.  Its awful.  Stay away if you want to be valued as an employee.   They could care less about you
bad,Will not ever work here again. Stressful not enough help too much asked for through corporate. Not enough hours given to employees. Pharmacist would get bonuses not techs.
bad,Do not make this a career unless you plan to be a pharmacist or science professional. Dont expect high pay if you are a pharmacy technician. The work life balance is uneven and this company will expect you to drive in the snow to come into work or they will write you up. This company does not care about the health of its employees if you have to flu and cannot find coverage they will make you come into work regardless because its a retail pharmacy. This company is money hungry allowing corporate to cut hours. Corporate will sometimes make visits to the pharmacy and often hound pharmacists if the scores are not on top as if pharmacists dont have any other job like being an actual pharmacist and taking care of patients medications and running a functional pharmacy with little helping hours. The extracare rewards card that each technician has to look up for each and every customer is useless unless you buy 10 prescriptions get $5 or you have extrabucks. The receipts printed is waisting a whole tree each time. Not everyone has email to sign up for coupons in email. The register prompts ask way too many questions for geriatric citizens to follow or read each and everytime. I get a lot of complaints that they feel like they are signing for a car or mortgage loan. For people that are in a hurry they prompts should not be so wordy. The computers sometimes go offline during peak hours for updates or malfunctions. Everyrime that happens technicians cannot perform their jobs and pur work gets pushed back.
bad,they would verbally tell me i do nothing with profanity. never told me what i was not doing or even try to show me. no coach and counseling. just verbally harassment. i don't see how people could work in that way. i went nuts and just walked after i talked to hr.
bad,I worked for Longs before it was bought out by CVS. It seemed to me as an employee that we were not valued and corporate saw us as disposable. They have high expectations for speed but do not provide the staffing
bad,Would not recommend a career here unless your soul is for sale.               They will push and ask from you everything and anything until you break.
bad,"Poor management and poor atmosphere, the place is filthy from the caliper of people they hire. Rules and regulations did not apply fairly to everyone. Too too too micromanaged. No consideration for being ill had to attend work even if u had the flu company expected a show up no matter how sich so that everyone else could get infected."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job is the techs I work with who I built lasting professional and personal relationships with. Upper management can use some work in getting to know their employees. Their pay doesn't reflect the good work that some employees put in. Raise would be like 0.7% and they would say its a cap off or some random budget claims. Workplace is typically understaffed and overworked. But some days, it's worth it to work with good techs who truly value their job and the patients we help."
bad,"Managers don't care about the employees. They're constantly looking for a reason to fire you. Don't expect to move up in the company because ALL managers keep their jobs for 15+ years."
bad,"My supervisor for CVS inside Target is the main reason why many of us pharmacists and technicians are leaving the company.  The management care nothing about patient care, just metrics."
bad,"This company has stripped the stores of the labor hours that are required to run the day to day business in both the front store and pharmacy. I have never seen such high turn over rate within a company , where its not worth getting to know someone's because they will be gone sooner than you think. Managers do not manage anyone they are glorified stockroom clerks that are salaried and can be used to work unlimited overtime if needed"
bad,"CVS is not a great place to work.  They are NOT family friendly, employee friendly or even health friendly.  Our health insurance stinks.  It is all about Wall Street and bonuses and pay for executives and to blazes with anyone not in Woonsocket."
bad,"They only care about money and profit. Employees are nothing to them . Treat you like nobody. Very aggressive about putting you down. Only money, money,"
bad,"No work life balance, expected to put in 10-20 hours of unpaid overtime a week. You are the only one in the store to perform every task. No hours and lack of staff means you are coverage if someone calls out regardless if its your day off. Training program is out dated and the lack of training is over whelming. Stores receive no extra time to train so employees have to train in between customers if possible. CVS says their motto is ""We Care"" but I think it is only about the insurance money for prescriptions because they definitely don't about their employees."
bad,CVS had a very high turn over rate and was always understaffed. The compensation was very very low. And the management was not good at all there. Would not consider working there again.
bad,A very stingy company. CVS HEALTH does not take care of their employees. Understaffed and trained poorly. CVS HEALTH will ask you to do more jobs than what you are properly trained to handle. Instead of hiring they will cross train you to learn multiple jobs but not compensate monetarily for all the jobs you are able to perform. So you will be paid to do one job but actually be asked to perform multiple jobs. The only way to avoid this will be to not advance beyond handling inbound calls which is entry level and the turnover is typical of any call center.
bad,"The store where I was was very stressful.  Poor management.  favoritism, Discrimination with me.  No fairness in work allocation and work distribution.  No teamwork. Work with no short breaks if work more than 4 hours for the day."
bad,Part Time Employees are given no paid time at all.  Voluntary Time Off is at the discretion of the manager of your department.  The turnover rate for the CVS Waverly DC is over 100%.
bad,The company is unfair. The advancement opportunities are limited. The pay is only good for new people starting off. If you’re a tenure employee you are never going to make great pay.
bad,Will never work for this company ever again! 14 years and they took my full employment status away when I was out for 3 weeks on a medical emergency. Had to use all vacation time to make up for time they took from me
bad,The manager is totally clueless.  They are more concerned with all the family members working there than the business.  I don't want associated with fraud billing.
bad,unfulfilling work environment. do not feel i was operating at my best. i desire to do better for my career path. I know that i can do better ina better work envitonemt
bad,Day to day it change some days way more busy then others. Under paid and over worked. A very emotionally and physically draining job with no benefits.
bad,"If you enjoy not receiving your paycheck on time or getting the incorrect amount of money for your hours worked, this is the place to be! If you enjoy poor management and rude employees, you'll be in heaven. For all others, please change your search criteria and move on."
bad,"horrible, racist management. i would never recommend this job to anyone. It is free slavery and they will never appreciate you. They love to hire brand new grads and abuse them because the experienced pharmacists report their abuse to HR."
bad,"Don't work for this company, period. Go anywhere worth your time to invest for your career. Go back to school for a degree or anything will be benefited you in the future. Never think to work for a company won't identify their employee as asset."
bad,There is so much potential and talent if and only if someone is removed and replace with someone who isn't afraid to let the lights shine where they need to shine. So many has come and gone because of being held back. I do miss this place and the passion of medicine.
bad,It’s a fun place to learn and give the best of customer service. But the amount of work and effort required per-day to the salary is peanuts. I think technician does most of the work this should be respected and given wage based on the effort and work put in and not merely just paid the minimum wages. But anyhow I’m with CVS for 6 Years.. been a bitter sweet moment. I love customer/ patient care and helping patients out is one of my best quality.
bad,Avoid working at CVS Pharmacy out in Ohio. It's very stressful and the store manager doesn't listen to you. Work somewhere else to avoid the chaotic mess and angry customers.
bad,"Supervisors work as manager pay rate 10.50  never enough  staff,  you have to run the register,customer service , walk customers to find items ,make pictures, stock, face store,multi task and you are the only one at the store."
bad,As a consultant you are asked to work over 12 hours a day expected to answer a call no matter what time at night. Weekends and they reprimand you. Just stay away management is horrible they don't want to back you up all groups are at each other's throats because they're so unorganized there's no process there's no flow they will try to pin everything on you. This is fact you need to talk to people directly do not listen to these positive reviews
bad,A typical day at work was always busy and productive.
bad,Is not a good place to work the Manager dont care about the people their make you life so miserable is gat living in the werehouse rats no no no cvs werehose 8201 cancellor dive is not a good place to work.
bad,"the company has started outsourcing jobs "
bad,Use this job as a free way to get your pharmacy tech license then get away as fast as you can. Under paid. Rude customers. Poor management. Over worked. No social life. Dont make this a career!!! Trust me!!!
bad,"An understaffed pharmacy due to high turnover rate and zero appreciation for staying late/coming in on your day off/etc. In fact, they expect it. Never get off work at scheduled time. Poor management with unrealistic expectations. Very unprofessional clique environment with favoritism. Those who aren't in the clique are talked bad about behind their backs. Always pushing for quantity instead of productive quality. Managers have no solution or ways to help you improve. They have an ancient computer system that hiders productivity and are scared to upgrade  to something new. Has had  the same managers for 20+ years that are scared of change even though it could help them by getting a more efficient system. I would NOT recommend this company to anybody."
bad,They had a specific team to monitor everyone's time. i mean we had like 12 codes to put into our phones when we were not at our desks. for going to the restroom to having a meeting and lunch and leaving for the day were just a few.
bad,"They hired me in with a shift differential of  $1.00 on Weekdays and $2.00 for working weekends.3 Moths later they did a shift Change and I got  Monday-Friday 8-5 PM"
bad,"This was the worst job ive had, it was through a temp agency. I came in entry level, poorly trained and the staff was rude, messy and if you had a question or made a mistake it was always your fault not the trainer who trained you."
bad,the managers are completely unreasonable . They cut hours at random and there is no notification about any hours being cut. The managers in general are just nasty and rude
bad,"poor manager, poor staffing, poor job to work due to no help at any time, heavy turn over. I was fired while manager was relocated after poor pharmacy review. I was released due to medical problems at that time, but told my numbers were not good"
bad,"I would not recommend this company. In my experience, they do not treat employees well at any level, and they do not foster a healthy work/life balance."
bad,"Management is a mess. "
bad,"Stressful work environment. Poor management, no respect for employees. No recognition for performance. Hardly gives a raise, cutthroat business.Pharmacy Technicians are treated like crude and aren't respected or acknowledged for their hard work and efforts."
bad,very poor working conditions in my opinion.  Management very poor and not understanding of employees.  Felt like a number instead of a person the entire time I've worked here.
bad,"There was no work life balance, it was constant pressure on your day off or to stay late or come in early almost every shift. They cut down hours when it is the busiest CVS in the district. On weekends you can work 8 to 9 hours a day with no break and not enough help. The Pharmacy still bought out another Pharmacy to add on to the work. It is put on you to have an additional task right before you leave so you never leave on time and when they do cut hours they do not tell you at all. Even if they drop someone to a few hours a week. Some days even on the weekday you do not get to eat even if you worked all day due to the demand and the poor schedule. These are simply illegal working conditions."
bad,worst place i ever worked i level up and was denied a raise was not told why i was just denied i passed my PTCB and did everything i had to but still denied the hours are horrible the do not care about they employees they just care about money and numbers
bad,Place was terrible with poor help. You continually work in a stressful environment and CVS doesn't pay you well enough. I checked my pay check and they didn't pay me for every hour continuously.
bad,Was told i was being hired as a full time employee. told i would have to quit my other job before hire as i did and then informed we could only work part time and if they like you then they would let you work full time. The manager of the pharmacy is rude harassing and unreasonable. The Pharmacy is understaffed and wont train people to work in all areas. they are to rotate employees in all areas through out shift i have done nothing but run a register for 10 solid hours and badgered the whole time. asked to not be bothered with consultations there to busy but is required by law to offer.  Do not get breaks and frowned on if you go to the bathroom.
bad,"management is bad, the workplace is a circus.The hardest part of the job is no one willing to teach you. Nothing is an enjoyable part of this job.  A typical day is a stress."
bad,"CVS Changed over the years. While the technology improved, the management and how the company treated employees became worse. Also, they are more concerned about the bottom line than the customers. The only customers they pay attention to are the ones that complain to get their way. The only reason management listens is to keep their scores high."
bad,"CVS is one of those big corporations that has no idea of what is going on in the store front. There is so much abuse of authority (managers running off good performers} and threats of termination. It's the only place I've worked at where your hard work and loyalty are rewarded with threats of write-ups and termination. Upper management is indifferent and takes no interest in their staff. I've seen Regional managers, District managers, and several store managers throw in the towel because there's just no hope of advancing. Most of the upper positions are hired from outside the organization."
bad,Currently am trying to get away from this company. Management released my medical info to family without my permission and spoke to my family about my work ethics. She makes negative remarks about my children and grandchildren because they live with me. The company was fine to work for at first but after 9+ years it has went downhill fast
bad,"I love working for CVS, if only it was more organized and less stressful than it would be a good, fun environment to work."
bad,do not work there it is awful they are more worried about the company then you.  No work life balance.  The c in caremark means change I had 7 managers in less then one year.
bad,"CVS is all about the money; are not loyal to their employees. Management is blind to, or have forgotten what it is like in the trenches. They want everything run according to an inflexible model no matter the particular circumstances of individual pharmacies."
bad,"This is an awful place to work. At my location you aren’t even allowed to use the restroom. I have been written up twice for using the bathroom outside of my break. I’m not even entirely sure that is legal. "
bad,they give you a job to do and only have 2 people working and you end up being the cashier instead of the shift supervisor. and they yell at you not finishing your job. but they don't understand that you were they cashier your entire shift
bad,"there was absolutely no communication skills in the pharmacy. felt very unappreciated        dont work for cvs unless you have no other choice "
bad,"got insulted and threaten by a bitter mean co-worker, manager did nothing nor cared, had to leave got treated unfairly, don't work here. i wish cvs care for their workers and customers. shame."
bad,"I suffered so much anxiety having to work there.  Oh not to mention, they only give you one break & that was lunch.  No matter how long your shift was, you only received one break.  I don't know if other stores are like that as well, I just know the ones in my city are."
bad,"Purposely understaffed for profits, 1 employee given the task of 5 employees. Constantly watched and berated for the simplest and most human mistakes. Had to be hospitalized for an emergency and got threatened with hour cuts because I did not ""warn them 2 weeks in advance"". Was hired for one position as a cashier for one cvs, then forced to be juggled between 3 different cvs. Expects you to be the only person on the floor, having to handle waves of customers, and do useless ""trainings"" on an ipad at your register during your shift. District manager comes in pretending to be a bad customer to make you slip up so they can punish you. All three supervising managers were rude, unhelpful, mean, and demonizing."
bad,I did not like working here they never gave me hours and didn't really explain things well and when they didn't have hours for me they used me as a cashier and paid me less
bad,"They don't pay enough for how much studying you have to do to get the national certification. Go work in a hospital if you want to go into pharmacy, not retail!"
bad,"Very high stress environment, with no team work.  Management is very unhelpful as well as very uninformed.  Management has family members working in the department that they are in charge of which is very unfair.  Extremely long hours for employees while management is out the door on time. Employees get a lot of paid time off but you literally have to fight to get it  Environment is toxic and very dirty.  Health insurance is very expensive and covers very little.  Moral is very poor among employees"
bad,"This job is the worst. They are constantly cutting hours; therefore, sometimes there's just ONE Technician and ONE pharmacist all day at a busy pharmacy. Not to mention they are also short staffed. You sometimes work long hours with just ONE break, which is lunch break, even though the policy says different. Mangers do not care about you. It's even frowned upon to bring water to drink because the rule is that techs cannot have any food or drinks in the pharmacy, even if you're there for long hours. There are way too many rules and procedures for everything. Some managers have favoritism and allow some technicians to do what ever  they want, while yelling and demeaning other technicians. Certain locations does not know the meaning of team work. The company is all about numbers, making sure percentage is high and the number of  prescriptions being sold are high as well. They don't care about the actual patient and what the patient needs and if you try to help the patients out then YOU'RE the one that gets a warning. Plus to transfer out your location, you will need your manager's approval, so basically if they cannot find anyone to replace you then you are stuck where you at because it will not be approved."
bad,"Retail Job is very demanding.  The environment was stressful.  Pharmacists, interns and technicians would cry once a month. Extremely demanding of perfect store scores, and lack of help from upper management to keep stores fully staffed and functioning."
bad,"Very stressful,no benefits, no raises,no bonuses. I do not recommend to apply here. Promotions are not fufilled.Tell you everything you want but do not pull through. Make sure everything is written and signed before going to any promotions."
bad,I would rather clean waste lagoons at a pig farm than return to CVS. They have no respect for employees and no ethics at all. Metrics are unobtainable and bonus unabchievable.
bad,This was an extremely stressful job with little to no growth opportunities. I was over worked and underpaid. The raises were given late every year.......
bad,"Well for starters, you dont get paid what you should. but that is for all corporate owned jobs.people are typically nice, but you are definitely overworked."
bad,Management isn't great. Stressful environment. No room for advancement. Childish behavior by grown adults. Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful Stressful
bad,I would never work here again. They are an awful company. They only care about making profit. They cut back hours and try to run a store with one cashier and one manager. Working back in their pharmacy was even worse. They were always under staffed.
bad,Working in the medical field where patients are demanding and sick... You try to be accommodating and follow your job description to tbe best of your ability. Not always easy.
bad,It's a job that's about it. Pay is not good. Not really professional. No communication. All you are is a worker bee. The hardest part of the job is no communication and being under paid.
bad,You need permission to use the bathroom or have a doctor appointment. You get written up for attending your uncles funeral or taking your one year with a fever to the doctor as the only times you call out. For a company that promotes health and well being this was beyond unacceptable
bad,"Hours are 8 AM- 5 PM, however, most days the staff is there until 7 PM. They are always understaffed, which puts undue pressure on all other staff members."
bad,This company does not care at all about its employees. It's best to work for Walgreens atleast the benefits are good. They will promise you a lot in the interview that will never happen. 3 people quit since I worked here. The customer always are upset because how things are and I agree. Everyone that works here hate there job and take it out on everyone including the customers. Managers don't ever know what there doing. Just stay away. Store 4799 stay away
bad,horrible hours no life but work inconsiderate could careless about their employees. you are promised to get off at a certain time in the morning and end up working 12-14 hours a day
bad,"dont care about customers or workers just about making money."
bad,This place will make you hate pharmacy benefits. They don’t train you well enough and they just throw you out there. When you need help the supervisor is no where to be found
bad,Managment all way up the chain is horrible and unwilling to address any issues employees have. Set up meetings and listen to you but do nothing to solve problems. Pay is a joke for amount of work put on 1 person.No teamwork...no leadership...no moral !!! Large company that cares about less people doing more work.. I'd rather scrub toilets !
bad,Worked for the company for eight years. They don't care about their internal employees. They will hire people outside the company and put them at a position above you and then ask you to train them.
bad,CVS is all about numbers. They couldn't care less about customers (They are definitely not patients). They call people 2 to 3 times a day 5 times a week to refill scripts because god-forbid they go to another pharmacy.  They have all these scores that the staff has to achieve and they realize by december that the numbers don't match productivity or the revenue $$$$ and every year in january they change what is being scrutinized.
bad,"I wish I could give 0 stars. This was by far the worst company I''ve ever worked for. My colleagues were nice but the company was way too stressful. The managers micromanage your every move. You aren't allowed to talk to anyone while you are on the clock. They have constant meetings, which occur during the work day, to tell you that you aren't being productive. They foster an environment where people stab each other in the back. On one instance someone was having a heart attack and they asked the person if they could stay a little longer because the work queues were full. It's the absolute worst."
bad,all about being number one!! forgetting their employees well being.. work load not deserving of pay they offer. not appreciated for your hard work and customer service you give.
bad,Never enough help people have no work ethic. You work full time hours however you are not a full time employee. they expect to much for one tech to handle
bad,"pharmacy setting not about patients as much as making your 'numbers' look good for the district manager"
bad,"It was a good job up until I returned from maternity leave. I love helping people and making sure the customers are well taken care of. If you don't have children, then this is the place for you"
bad,"I hated every minute I worked there. They are racist and only promote their own. They will under pay blacks and lie to them about"
bad,Worked for Longs Drugs which was bought by CVS. Could not believe the changes that took place. Lost every Long's employee eventually. Lost nearly every Long's customer eventually. Horrible business model at the store level. I'm sure they are highly profitable at the corporate level.
bad,"The pay was low, the work extreme, and the manager was focused on facing the store not the cycling of inventory, customers, or the happiness of workers...facing two hours minimum. If anything was out of line, and there was at least one item...everyone faced the store again."
bad,cvs was horrible it started with just getting 12 hours a week then when i worked 30 or more hours i had to work at multiple locations also i worked the register a lot and didnt reallly get to use the knowledge i have from my degree and my phaarmacy tech license also they have poor management
bad,"CVS Coram Norwood,Ma is the most miserable, depressing place Ive worked in. My typical day as a pharmacy tech, fixing someone else's screw up. I wish they would pay attention to their work instead of gossiping about a affair going on in the work place. The workplace consist of 98% female, so drama and gossip all day long. The pharmacists would hide their work and bring the work out at the end of their shift. It's insane here. Do not apply here!"
bad,"My typical day was answering new patient calls. One call after another, never have time to eat because we were so understaffed. There were so many emptied cubicles and not enough people working the phones. The pharmacy director ran this office like a Indian tech support call center. I can't leave my cubicle to use the restroom because it was so busy. I can't get any help from others. They were busy talking and gossiping about a coworker having an affair with the boss."
bad,"This place expects way to much from employees with little compensation for new responsibilities. I get that being a public corporation, shareholders are a top priority but employees should be treated with decency as well."
bad,"It was absolutely terrible. The people are rude, and the higher ups come in at the worst times and don't really help out much. Overall, some of the people are great. But, the people I worked with were just terrible and would like to pick on/harass me."
bad,The company cares more about making money and its customers than it does about it's employees. Uses metrics to determine how well stores are doing and doesn't show appreciation to its employees. Doesn't have much room for growth
bad,Not any I didn’t like working there because where I worked they wasn’t trying to advance anyone within the company. I called out one day and they lied to the unemployment office and told them I quit and I came in the next day and the store manager told me he had already replaced me with someone else.
bad,"The management  team very poor "
bad,"A typical day at CVS entails a multitude of tasks with no help. There are some workers that go above and beyond while there are some that do not even accomplish the bare minimum which puts more pressure on others. There are employees that constantly call out only because there are no repercussions/accountability. Depending on your learning style you may get the opportunity to learn a lot however if you are not afforded that opportunity during your shift you will have to be proactive by staying after your shift (depending on your store they may allow you to stay on the clock and be paid for your time or you'll have to learn off the clock which is not paid) to learn as much as you can. DO NOT under any circumstances EXPECT your hard work to be appreciated or rewarded. You could do the job of 10 workers, be paid minimum wage, come to work everyday you are scheduled or on your day off, and you can still receive a NI (needs improvement) or ME (Meets Expectations) all because of employees who don't put forth the same effort as you which resulted in a bad review score for the store at the end of the year. The most enjoyable part of my job is the learning. The hardest part of my job is having to constantly pick up the slack for others that barely do the minimum just because they do not feel like it. I had to come to an understanding that management does not believe in corrective action which is extremely detrimental to the work environment and causes a hostile work environment at times among co-workers. I would not, under ANY circumstances, recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,No one ever knew what was going on. Training was terrible and not enough hours were ever provided by the company to meet demand. I have worked for other places in the past that would cut hours but CVS was just unreasonable.
bad,"The job was very boring, people are nice but there are people who are permanent will tell on you all the time. As a contractor they kept extending my contract over 10 months. I burned out had to request time off no pay and everyone got hit w/occurrences no matter what. Its not worth it to stay, My advice get in and keep looking until youfind something permanent."
bad,"Coming into the store were already behind, and the rest of the day were playing catch up. Insurance companies place hurdles that techs have to figure out ways to get medications covered."
bad,"While our pharmacy manager was very caring to all patients and staff, upper level management gave no indication of caring about patients or employees.  Pay was low and the pharmacy has been understaffed for the entirety of my time there.  This would not be an issue if there was compensation.  People are consistently asked to work with no compensation for coming in when not scheduled."
bad,Too big of a company with only focus on sales.  Continues to make poor decisions that do not help business and blame employees instead of development and management.  Company will not be able to get back to high standing without a change in focus back to patients health and customer service in pharmacy.
bad,"alot of indians "
bad,I really didn't enjoy working in CVS. I didn't receive any training or help that I needed to work there. I felt like I was just thrown on the floor to learn everything on my own.
bad,I worked under a very poor management. I was always over worked and barely had a chance to take the lunch break. I was treated unfairly and they did not have a quality work environment
bad,"worst place to work,low moral all the time, no advancement in pay, insurance fraud, poor poor management, Management degrades employees below them, policy's on facility and long term care issues are never consistent, mangers keep huge changes from employees"
bad,Not happy with the whole situation and think that the promise of pay raise and advancement were never there. the management was horrible and refused to help to create a team environment
bad,CVS pays its employees bare minimum. I had been a tech there for 8 years and barely made over 10 an hour. They set you up for failure. They expect you to meet ridiculous goals and when you can't reach then they just take away hours instead of trying to figure out what the problem is.
bad,"i hate this job, and the company they have horrible systems, and no resources. They are also going to be implementing a limit of 2 bathroom breaks a day. just a horrible company"
bad,"No lunch breaks for pharmacists. "
bad,Company does not compensate fairly there are no advancement opportunities majority of management is terrible at their job. hardest part of the job was the lack of equality in treatment of the employees. the management was too worried about being your friend to do a decent job managing their employees
bad,Worst job Ive ever had. Pay was only decent because you worked over 80 hours a week. There was no balance between work and life. There was no understanding from manager.
bad,Very cut throat and stressful environment.  Not enough help is ever given but always cutting back on technician and pharmacist hours.  No recognition or appreciation shown for good work.
bad,"There benefits were pretty great, but a lot of money came out of your paycheck for that as well.  The hours have been cut, they expect alot more, and the worry is customer health and errors and that is why I left there after almost 8 years, the lack of help, and killing a patient that worried me."
bad,"it was so stressful, and dealing with customers who wyould be so rude and mean to you for no reason, and take out all their anger on you. it was not worth it at all"
bad,"Was discriminated against by coworkers and because of union status, no consequences for that person. Went through proper channels of reporting but was punished in retaliation."
bad,"CVS is full of managers that care about the bottom-line. They want you to work hard, hardest you ever did, and then they ""reward"" you with more hard work. The annual review and compensation is a laughable 2.5% for ""meets requirements"" which is for working 50+ hours, multiple departments, and cross training everyone. The upper management cares nothing but themselves and saving a buck. Worst management ever! Highest turn around and they wonder why."
bad,"manager and supervisor was not that supportive of staff. low salary, no benefits. do not want to say anymore negative. I will not recommend working there."
bad,A typical day was boring. I didnt learn anything. Management was horrible. The workplace culture sucked. The hardest part of my job was working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was when they fired me.
bad,"Helping the customers and seeing them leave happy or satisfied. Being an employee there is nothing to brag about. you are never treated as an equal, you are below managements favorites."
bad,"Company is not concerned with employees. They say they are, but they do nothing to show it. It's all about numbers and the dollars in their pockets. Would not recommend."
bad,"next please, its all about pushing out prescriptions. Don't think just do. If someone complains, your wrong regardless and they might get a gift card. STOP and think hard before selling your soul to the devil."
bad,"The worse place to work . Very stressful and some pharmacist s are crazy and just try you look bad. Favoritism, favoritism all over the place . There is two side bad and good and if you're are in the bad side you are nothing"
bad,I have not worked there in several years but it is my understanding that it is worse than ever.  the scheduling is accurately referred to as putting out fires
bad,With a store the size of Walmart I was the only supervisor with one cashier and it wasn't safe closing at night with us two women. GET MORE EMPLOYEES OR JUST SHUT IT DOWN
bad,The company is micromanaged and very stressful.  You cant ask a question.  If you need a filler job that is the place to go.  It not a good place to work.
bad,"They will do everything and find anyway to max out one potential for work. Plus they are always devalue the service and hard work of employee put in. Cheap lunch, everything is cheap"
bad,"Dont work at the Langley Park store its horrible, the customers are great people but the employees have terrible training and in turn makes bad customer service"
bad,"Doesn't care about its employees , poor pay, poor management, unhappy customers, horrible hours, no flexibility. I will never work for this company again."
bad,"Poor management, I never felt comfortable speaking to my supervisor about anything and she also was never there and available to speak to. The atmosphere was gloomy also."
bad,My supervisor had poorly defined goals for myself and coworkers. Upper Management was a joke. You were threatened with a write up if/when management would decide to change the rules or way of doing business.
bad,"Company leaders are blinded by their own financial gain.  There is not any patient care, it’s numbers, and guest service scores.  Stores achieve fiscal goals and staff is not rewarded other than a non-dishwasher save coffee mug.  Everything is lip service and who can “one up” the other person.  Horrible hardware, software, operational support, and professional respect."
bad,"CVS is the worst job I've had. Hours always cut, awful pay, they expected so much of us, it got so bad to where I couldn't pay my bills. Management lacked intelligence and was always hard to communicate with. When the big bosses would come in they would take away our time trying to talk to us about phone calls we couldn't adequately get prescriptions out in time. Not to mention we were under staffed and didn't have enough hours to cover each week."
bad,"Terrible hours, no advancement, terrible pay, customers were always rude, they expect too much of you................................................."
bad,This is the worst company anyone could every work for! They are money hungry and don't care about their employee's or customer's. I worked for Cvs for 13 years and they are horrible to their staff
bad,I would never in my life go to work for this company again! By far the worst experience I have encountered in my life. I do not recommend anyone to seek employment here. HIGH TURNOVER RATE!
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for. Underpaid, overworked, poor management, favoritism, back stabbing. There aren't enough words to describe how terrible this company is."
bad,"Very stressful atmosphere. Empoyee moral is low. No coverage when someone calls out sick, putting extra load on everyone else and no one in management cares."
bad,I was robbed at CVS and upper management did nothing to help with relocation or anything.  I would never work for this company again.  I don't think they are a very reputable company
bad,"Terrible managers, throwing pharmacists to the wolves, and a horrible environment for technicians that facilitates back stabbing and a cut-throat environment."
bad,"Working there for years, and terminated without cause the day after I called Ethics hotline on the Head guy for discrimination. "
bad,"long hours. have to stay over often unpaid. management gives you very little to work with and expects a lot in return. Good for money, horrible for work life balance."
bad,"typical days range from 8 to 14 hours"
bad,"You go on vacation, you get moved. And the kicker is that your supervisor doesn't even call you! The days are very stressful. Supervisors have goonies they send around to spy on people. This place is filled with drama."
bad,I HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THIS BRANCH. I worked for the Tampa branch from 2008-2017. I started  off as a PSR I and it took until 2014 to become PSR II because I was out and had to get rehired and start from the bottom up again. I was on the conversion team for 6 months which traveled to all of the branches all over the United States to train other PSR's on the new system which is now HBS/SPARCS. I received a demotion once I was done traveling for this company and ended my tenure as a Pharmacy Tech I.
bad,CVS workers are under paid and work in a stressful work environment. Corporate does not give enough hours to be able to have enough coverage for a day. Long lines because of this and not enough help on the floor. No security at all for store. Weekends are the hardest.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was clocking out. This was the worst place to work ever. Management was horrible. The pharmacist were just as awful to the techs.
bad,"The actual work is great helping customers with their Part D plan inquiries and refill request was fun; however, management made the job difficult.  Management had favorites which were usually relatives and friends who they helped hire,"
bad,I would never recommend anyone to the horror that this place was known for.  This was the worst work experience that I had ever had.  The employees were split between 2 areas and they would clash on several occasions.
bad,"This company is very heartless, and doesn't know how to lead.  There is a difference between managing and leading; CVS creates managers, not leaders.."
bad,I don't have too much to comment on cvs pharmacy just that the store is overly crowded for the space that is given to have all of the floor merchandise in the aisles. just a typical retail experience.
bad,Managment is a joke advancement is a joke they do train you but most people get trained and quit to go somwhere better pay is a joke I would never recommend that someone work here its  a joke
bad,"not the best place to work at "
bad,"Overall my experience working at CVS pharmacy has not been very good. Every day is filled with drama, and it is not a healthy work environment to be in. If you start off as a cashier do not become a supervisor. The manager will tell you that you are getting a decent raise when in reality it is a lie. The manager will try to deceive you into doing her own job, and you will not be getting paid anymore to do so. This is a job that shouldn't be stressful, but in reality has made several people i work with depressed and that should not be happening. Do not work at the Kearney Mo. CVS."
bad,laid off no notice i would not have anyone work there. lay people  off with no notice. a lot of people at once. Hard for anyone to come on full time terrible
bad,"One of the worst/stressful jobs I ever had. Went through different managers who gave employees the run-arounds. Whenever you needed to get a hold of manager, you'd have to wait at least two to three days (or more) to hear back from him. Management doesn't schedule people accordingly. Too much of day crew versus night crew BS. Not worth working overtime if asked because everyone is willing to take advantage of you."
bad,"Managers are lazy but want to rush you and complain if you're moving slow and complaining managers are not suppose to do our job "
bad,"pay sucks unless your a pharmacist really. min. wage, the worst hours, coworkers were rude. was not a positive work environment, everybody was miserable."
bad,"i learned is  while working at this site, is that some people are very happy on buying products here but some people dont either bother to pay, they just steal there merchandise."
bad,"CVS is a stressful job, the management is not the greatest, and the pay is the minimum. There is no room for growth or job advancement, and the corporation does not care about their employees."
bad,"poor management, no room for advancement, more work for less pay. Was not given enough hours to learn the job. A lot of training and no shift hours given for hands on experience."
bad,"horrible management, working conditions and zero or very little help to perform job which makes your metrics suffer. no breaks or lunches either, only when one is caught up, which is impossible."
bad,Not a great place to work and compared to other places with the same job the pay is less for the same amount of work they do provide you with the training but can't keep employees after they finish training
bad,"a mob of unhappy customers greet you as you enter the pharmacy where a couple of stressed out coworkers are overwhelmed and relieved to have back up but are ""done"" with the day forcing you to work twice as hard the minute of your arrival. from there you realize there's no organization or workflow causing management to become distracted and impatient. but the fact that customers and coworkers are unhappy is irrelevant because the only thing that matters to upper management is how your store looks on paperwork."
bad,"Cut throat, and you got worked to the bone. Told you're 'Part Time' but work over 40 hours and 12 hour days. Never offered benefits. Promised a chance to move up in the company but opportunity is ever given to you. You're judged by who you, and criticized. A horrible work environment. No benefits, just painful days and a lack of empathy from anyone. Teaching was good at the beginning, but once in the field it was a 'each man for himself.'"
bad,"CVS has nothing to do with helping people, its cut throat, management is awful, at this location, and poor treatment of employees is rarely addressed.  Do not Work For CVS!"
bad,This companies leadership was very dysfunctional. They do not care about the growth of their employees. There is no standard training or operating procedures. A chaotic work environment creates a very low morale work place.
bad,Lack of support hours and pay is so poor no one wants to work terrible work conditions. Management does not listen to ideas and computer systems are outdated and slow
bad,The management was very poor. The customers that come to CVS are very rude and inconsiderate. I do not feel that it was a great working environment. I was very stressed everyday
bad,"No growing opportunities or professional development. No training, lack of leadership. Low pay rate and super low employee morale. The working condition are the worst and employees are treated like inhumane"
bad,"This is OmniCare nursing facilities in Thousand Oaks, CA."
bad,"Low pay. Management turnover, favoritism. They don't care about your personal life.  Patients there are old and want you to depend on them hand and foot."
bad,I would not suggest this place for employment they do not take care of their employees and sometimes it can get overwhelming.  Find somewhere else yo work.
bad,"bad management"
bad,"There were no benefits outside of a refrigerator and an ice machine.  Employees stole food from one another with little reaction from management other than an email stating ""that was not cool"".  "
bad,None of the upper management care about the employees. The make you feel like your job is on the line all the time. under staffed and the turnover rate is super high for such a big company.
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for after working for 3 years and supposedly getting ""seniority"" I was moved back to the night shift with no notice or asking from my manager. The pay is not worth the aggravation by a long shot. Managers play favorites and tend to pass the buck when confronted.  Everyone hates the company and turnover is very high. The benefits are also not good since they were bought out by cvs"
bad,"Don't have any reviews for this job To much drama with younger generation, didnt have no respect for the elders or US Veteran The managers had there favourite s and didnt have any communication"
bad,"better place to work, always changing never the same, no sick time, if you call in sick it is an occurrence and three in a year you can get fired.  super visors are two faced and can harm your career"
bad,"A day at work was busy/fast pace from beginning of shift to end"
bad,"Not great pay, stressful work environment.  Was let go based on lies from management.  Horrible training with out of date training material.  Not a technically sound company with the store app and programs used.  If you asked or complained about your work schedule, that gives CVS the right to let you go.  Not a good place to work.  A company that I would not recommend to friends to work at.  Very disappointing!!! Will not return!!"
bad,"No real chance for advancement, not welcoming, not enough training, very small cramp workspace, the pay never changes more than maybe .40 cents A YEAR, high stress at times, schedule not flexible at all!!!"
bad,"High turn over, racist management, poor training, I had seven supervisors in in 1 year. I was harassed by the director and another co work in addition to my direct supervisor. The company did nothing about it."
bad,Very outdated technology. Work you like a dog. Benefits are good though. Hours are horrific. High turnover of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Thumbs down overall.
bad,CVS Health shows lack of concern in regards to employees as well as lack of professionalism. Supervisors conduct themselves in a very hostile manner. I would not recommend this company to anyone for consumers or careers.
bad,They have no stability.  You are hired in on a certain schedule.  Then once you arrive at work you find out if you have to work overtime.  There is no room to advance.
bad,"Unorganized, metric based, rude unprofessional supervisor fussing, yelling at you all day. Running around like a crazy person doing various things at once although multitasking is key this is a horrible way to do it. Was not properly trained... list goes on forever!"
bad,"General pharmacy technician work, pay could be better, hours are flexible if you work enough otherwise you'll be put wherever on the schedule. wouldnt reccomend this as a full time position to anyone ever."
bad,"discrimination by managers and team..gc betrayal,they promised ,but they never started.so many other stories"
bad,This company stress employees to the brink of break. Job requirement is manageable but the managers and ceos of the company are poor people managers. will be nice to hire more qualified managers. some managers at this company have no proper qualification to lead a team for example revoked/near revoked licenses
bad,"They would much rather overwork the few employees they have than hire enough to keep up with the demands of the job. They might start at a ""decent"" wage, but you will get a 15 cent raise every year after that, which won't even keep up with cost of living increases. The longer you work here, the less you will make, relatively speaking."
bad,"This company does not deserve any stars. I did work with some very nice people and great Pharmacists, but overall, just a very extremely negative place to work.  Not enough help, no accountability. Poor pay and insurance benefits, lack of management, outdated computers, extremely heavy workload!"
bad,"They fired me prematurely.  I had two mixed totes, with three being allowed, and they said we have to let you go.  You do all the physical work filling all the prescription mail orders while others enjoy their work life telling you what to do."
bad,Manager practice speaking of employees to each other in a negative way. Company does not reward their employees!!!!!! I have nothing good to say about this company.
bad,"they do not value the employees, just what the customer wants treat the employee like garbage i had learn a lot but it just digusting the situation they put you throu"
bad,"I was scheduled long hours and paid low wages. Worked nights and weekends. Pay raises were not given on your work performance,... I enjoyed my customers and missed them when I left."
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone, they do not are what they pay you, they do not care that you have children, they do not care if you have something going on in your life they want you there at work."
bad,"this company is not organized, always messing up in checks, does not offer room for advancement or overtime, don't have pay raises, employees are over worked and under paid"
bad,I worked in the Pbm in wilkes barre fellow employees great.  Fired the best supervisor they had and they wonder why union will be coming again. Can't work here with family
bad,This company is a great start to learn about pharmacy if you have no experience.But if you have pharmacy experience it is worth the pay.the amount of work and stress is really ovewhelming.
bad,"unorganized and unprofessional corporate company. Training is 2 weeks and what is reviewed is nothing compared to REAL work. Management acts like your supposed to know what your doing off top, so don't ask questions. Worst experience ever!"
bad,"I will NEVER work for CVS when I graduate. The pharmacy that I was placed at, all I can say is that, I was so excited for this amazing experience and then I concluded that no way could never work for company who abuse employees like they do. I have work morals and work ethics. CVS fails at both of these. Just imagine how many others like me are out there. When you calculate this just think of all the millions of dollars we save the company. I think intern are scared to say anything because they hope to have a job at CVS. The company uses this to their advantage and continue to abuse their powers. There is no hardest part of the job other than the work environment and the management at my location. The most enjoyable part of my job was even in the mist of a chaotic environment, that all just floated away the instance realized that I made a difference in someone's day big. No matter small. No matter bid  That a customer genuine care and consideration."
bad,"Poor raises and excuses to not give one. "
bad,Don't work here. Upper management only cares about themselves and their numbers. They don't understand that there's more to running a pharmacy than forcing flu shots on people. Stay away
bad,"Horrible Experience/ Long Hours looking at insurance claims with little to no training, given just minutes to look at each screen for errors.  Management focused more on quantity than quality."
bad,"Company itself was okay, it just was not the company for me. Call guidelines were a little unrealistic. Very high turn around, pay was not competitive."
bad,"No chance for advancement"
bad,"This company micro-manages each and every thing you do"
bad,"Terrible place of employment "
bad,"CVS system is terrible they try to improve things to make it easier but that is not the case there are so many problems and makes more work for us employees. They over work us, never giving us enough staff and hours. We should be getting paid more"
bad,"mean pharmacist "
bad,"system is corrupted"
bad,i had incidents that occurred while dealing with my on duty pharmacy technician/ manager  he was extremely rude and   would make me feel extremely uncomfortable and would throw things at you i loved my job but management made it very hard to  love coming to work
bad,Don't work here if you have other options. It sucks. Management and supervisors don't care about you. They just need a warm body to fill space at the front. They try and persuade you out of taking sick days because it's more work for them. Don't work here.
bad,"Customer service filled prescriptions, filed prescriptions, inventory. Answered phones. Received faxes from doctor's offices. Data entry. Collect stock bottles of prescriptions and put them away."
bad,No room for growth unless you become s pharmacist. Measly pay. I've been a tech for about 8 years. Raises are low 20-50 cents if you're lucky. This job is for a teenager with no bills.
bad,Horrible company that could care less for their employees. management and corporate structure is constantly changing. The job description and obligations completely change from the time of interview to what one is tasked with. Supervisors and management are inept and under trained. Harassment of the s#xual nature by management is over looked and brushed under the rug. Any whistle blower is persecuted to the point of quitting. Branches close at random and the best employees only stay long enough to find another job. Avoid at all cost.
bad,No on site pharmacy manager.  Negative and cut throat to the point of employees shredding or hiding other employees work.  Petty and vindictive catfights often take precedence over work.
bad,I've never worked at a place where it was so stressful and unorganized. I don't recommend anyone to work her the management wasn't well organized the way it should have been
bad,"Taking care of our customers needs. Check in vendors. Put away merchandise. Pharmacy put in prescriptions, fill, and check out customer. Working here I don't have a chance to move up in the company."
bad,"Worse job I have ever had. Management is super nasty. Some sups stare at you like you shouldn't be there daily. Not approachable at all. This company does not train whatsoever. Runs a point system, after 10 call ins your fired. Don't be sick or have sick children. If you can find a better job, I suggest you do."
bad,"Cvs is very unprofessional, the pay is low ,  pharmacy techs do more than the Pharmaciest whom is always stressed and rude to the tech and we got paid their chump change and talked to like animals"
bad,"They treat their employees horribly. They are all about numbers and couldn't care less if their employees feel valued. I've never felt like I was valued as an employee, even by my immediate managers."
bad,I've been there for 12 years no progress or advancement. Great people I work with but I would not recommend working for this company. They will drain you and you get no praise for the amount of work you do for them.
bad,Fill prescriptions all day. Didn't like having to shove the store card down peoples throats and management didn't really have the employees backs. Customers could treat employees as badly as they wanted and hey couldn't do anything about it.
bad,"This place will drain you out, negative work atmosphere and both physically and mentally draining. Enjoyed the experienced, grateful that for the amount of education it gave me."
bad,"If you're interested in pharmacy school, working as a technician until you're accepted and can work as an intern is great. You learn a lot etc. working as a technician. you'll be underpaid and used, if you're looking for an atmosphere and company that treats you like an asset and not a liability. Try an independent pharmacy or outside of retail."
bad,"This job was not a good fit for me for various reasons, such as the environment, I was working with a temporary agency, I was not hired full time as I was promised.  And so many other reasons."
bad,"zero work life balance"
bad,this company is very unorganized when it comes to new work ethics and training. everyone trains differently and everyone that trains different is taught different. management is also inconsistent with the employees
bad,"Even though it is decent pay it is not worth the headache and the hostile work area you have to put up with, I would not recommend it to anyone. And there has been overtime, but not everyone does there fair share of picking up the slack."
bad,"Trust me they do not care about their employees. All they care about is their numbers. Management does not have your back. Even HR will throw you under the bus. Most stressful job I have ever had. I worked there for only one year and had three different managers, who were all fired because the general manager is as crazy as they come. Stay away! Not worth any amount of money they are willing to pay you."
bad,"CVS is a company with a grinding work environment set by the unrealistic expectations of the corporation. The store is allotted minimal hours to meet a large list of daily and weekly tasks. Little opportunity for advancement. Management is urged to comply with the demands of a customer, despite company rules. Employees are hassled when calling in sick. During poor winter weather situations, when travel is hazardous, employees are told by upper management they are not permitted to call in, despite safety concerns. It's as if the company does not care about employee safety. Little opportunity for advancement,"
bad,"Training is very disorganized and that place do not work as a team. The supervisors don't care about their employees. Coaching is horrible. Medicaid department itself is desperate need of new team leaders and supervisors, the ones they have their at Richardson office just don't care and they come to work with that , don't bother me mentality. It's their job to reach out and be proactive. If they showed concern that department would be more successful."
bad,"Hard work for little money. Need to increase the pay for technicians drastically. Pharmacists don't take breaks, so you won't get a break unless you demand one. Often indirectly pressured into passing up on break."
bad,Worst place to work. Like to lie to employees and withhold information. Scheduling was always an issue. God forbid you needed time off to see a physician or take your kids anywhere.
bad,"I have numerous degrees in different fields and an abundance of experience. I took the job at CVS as something to do during the day to keep productive. Throughout my careers, I have takn pleasure in the work environments of the previous companies. CVS however was hands down the worst company to work for. They ripped me off, they refused to pay holiday pay, they refused to pay me my unused vacation time and bribbed to pay it if only I stayed with the company. Young managment and high turnover was the worst."
bad,I have learned to take being a pharmacy technician seriously. I have also learned that everyone of the customers needs are different. Also that evry customer is unique in their own way.
bad,management sucks. they dont care about you as long as they meet their numbers. would not suggest for anyone else to work here. please do not go to the cerritos location
bad,"treat employees unfairly"
bad,"I work for CVS as a shift lead, i am full time with out full time hours, im lucky to get 30hrs, our Manager sits in the office all the time leaves early and does not carry his load, he xpects all of his shift leads to do his Job.."
bad,I was treated poorly here.  Used as a data entry zombie.  I was yelled at by angry patients that were not helped on my second day.  I was not supposed to run the register and got into trouble for that.  Don't really care it was an externship.  I was not paid and I am glad I changed my mind about making this my career!
bad,"Horrible work environment, if you work with people you like than CVS would be fine. Everybody I got along with in that pharmacy ended up quitting because our pharmacy manager was horrible."
bad,They are one of the worst companies to work for hard to get promoted you get sent home is caught too close to the building even in your car smoking a cigarette
bad,"My first job was at CVS while I was going to school. There was no training involved and I was often left alone to manage the store with no training. When I gave my schedule, the manager would schedule me to work during my classes. My education was more important to me than a minimum wage job, but it wasn't important to them. If you are looking for a first job they most likely will hire you but will throw you into the fire with no training. If you're experienced the pay does not reflect your duties, there is constant turn over with people quitting."
bad,"Dead end job with no room to advance, terrible pay, dismal benefits, CVS overlords, demanding hours, no overtime to compensate all the work. Hours constantly being cut by Mother CVS while work ethic and integrity get flushed."
bad,"Over worked, underpaid, and understaff is what you will learn at CVS. And if your part time you get no benefits, no paid time off, no medical, dental, vision. you get a petty sum of 30 cents a year ( if your lucky) as a pay raise. if you want to learn what favoritism is, working at CVS the place to learn it, been there for 3 long years still get treated like a piece of trash. Rite-Aid, Walgreens, Wal-Mart all pay higher salaries then CVS. You would have a better career digging in dumpsters finding soda cans, and selling the cans to a recycling center for 5 cents each, than working here."
bad,"a typical day at work at cvs is terrible, it is always short staffed, the compensation is terrible for the work one is doing. Company will not stand up for you and will terminate you for the most irrelevant things. If you're nationally certified, dont work here."
bad,"I was contracted (temporary employee) for a year of employment, worked for a couple months. Management was very unprofessional and deceiving how they manipulated me. Supervisor gave me a couple days off because they were upgrading computer system and claimed very few people would be working. I returned next day to get something I needed and my access device was de-activated denying me access to the building. A supervisor met me in the lounge, stated no contracted (temp employees) were working, I noticed another temp sitting in the lounge taking a break, I commented about her statement, she was speechless. I realize I was only a temporary staff but they didn't have to be sneaky and dishonest with me, all they needed to do was end my contract and I would have understood. I contacted my Temp agency agent and reported what I experienced, the agent had no knowledge of Omnicare management reporting me off for 2 days. I truly believe management purposely didn't report that they were giving me the days off because they were  planning on making it look like I didn't report to work, therefore voluntarily ending my contract leaving me look  irresponsible. I would personally not recommend accepting a position with this company, no job security and management very deceiving and unprofessional environment."
bad,"Work days are stressful, and management sucks! Company doesn't care for their employees. Just really an awful place to work. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy"
bad,"I enjoy helping my patients and doing anything i can for them however cvs steps-in most of the time to play big brother and makes it harder for me to do my job and help the person you needs it the most, the patient. Instead they have multiple lil task which consumes a lot of time that id have to help the people you want as returning customers and inventory things such as the cycle counts somehow never being right"
bad,Never follows through with what they tell you. and the people you work with most the time will not carry their weight so you have to do it all and it makes it super stressful.
bad,"It's not worth it unless you need experience for your resume"
bad,"Most of the employees are lazy, its not any room for advancement or growth, nor is it enough hours there to make a living and have this job/or field as an career."
bad,"Was not good. Long hours. Boring"
bad,"The company doesn't acknowledge hardworking employees, tries to low-ball past employees with poor compensation for their excellent experience. No room for growth. They don't allow 15 minute breaks that you are supposed to be allowed."
bad,"Worst place to work. Constant drama, attitudes, and pharmacy manager and pharmacists do not treat their customers with respect. Customers will complain and no one makes an effort to make customers happy."
bad,Every morning I would go in to work wondering who would yell at me and every evening I would leave feeling like a dog with it's tail between it's legs. A good place to learn about pharmacy operations and then move on to a better place. Managent was cold and demeaning. Work culture punitive.  Hardest part of the job was always receiving new mindless tasks from corporate yet constantly enduring cuts in technician hours. An awful place to work  If I could give it 0 stars I would.
bad,This is a horrible place to work. Too many politics and personal relationships. Management does not care about your ideas or issues you may be having.
bad,CVS is a very demanding workplace.  The pharmacist is typically there with little to no help at all.  Management only cares about the numbers regardless of how you get them.
bad,they put a lot of pressure on the technicians and they do not care about the Cleanliness of the pharmacy and the safety of the patients. working with them would make the person lose his or her self esteem
bad,"**STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY**"
bad,Management where I was located was not very good. But I do believe it all depends on locations and teams. Training that is. Provided was very helpful and resourceful.
bad,"DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME. Now, understandable a lot of reviews are just bitter discarded employees. I am a current employee and I must say this is one of the worst jobs I've EVER worked for. You get two weeks of ""training"" and once you hit the floor you realize that everything they told you in training is a lie. None of what you learned is even relatively applicable to your daily job function. Two out of 5 of the supervisors are cool if you get them. They do not treat people the same across the board. Some people get to do whatever, while others get  reprimanded  for every little thing. You are extremely over worked for horrible  pay. They say your job functions are simple but it's not. The food is over-priced. I would have expected so much better for a company. Also they say there is room for growth, lies if you are good at your job prepare to stay right where you are."
bad,Don't know how they keep in business. Worst customer service. Don't train have to learn on your own.  Manager don't care about your health or family issues as long as someone shows up for work and there is a person to show up to cover shifts.
bad,CVS is the type of company that will hire you with the promise of hours and advancement. then they will proceed to reduce your hours due to the fact that their company is failing.
bad,This company is terrible to work for. Have been with cvs for almost 6 years. Still have no benefits and haven't really gotten any raise. The raise I got last year for my 5 years was 44 cents. That's a slap in the face! Never any team work and my manager let's coworkers and customers talk to me any type of way. Its just an all around bad environment.
bad,Poor compensation and benefits. Upper management completely out of touch with clients and needs. Place unnecessary pressure on supervisors and call takers. Completely disorganized and often times manufactures reasons to terminate people.
bad,"Your day would start with a client specific set to review prior authorizations in Medicare part D. When a question arose, it was hard to get help and when you did, it conflicted with what you learned in training. The support staff did not agree on resolutions, which is critical with adhering to the government regulations."
bad,I would invite any one to apply for this position . it is a great company and great benefits. great company to better your skills and grow professionally
bad,"No one in management knows ANYTHING, SO disorganized!"
bad,"You'll like this job if you like having all your hours constantly taken away, and the customers treat you terrible because of it. Also if you enjoy abusive drug users threatening you to fill their medications."
bad,"management needs improvment and better communication skills. During training my system did not work for 2 weeks  while everyone else in my class started taking calls, all i could do was listen. once my system started working i was started taking calls with no training recap."
bad,"Omnicare Of Rochester was not agood place to work. The management was not supportive to staff, and unrealistic demands were made on staff with insufficient staffing to achieve results. They treated the employees like cattle."
bad,"I worked here for several months. Management is horrible and rude, very condescending. I was not paid for 23 hours and refused to pay me. I took them to the board of labor, and they expect you to do every thing while being understaffed."
bad,Unfortunately this place is not far to everyone and would rather pick favorites than those who do there work. A typical day at was going to ones desk and hearing bosses yell at employees in front of everyone and listening to non job related conversations by supervisors.
bad,"It is stressful and poorly managed environment that pressures employees to change their outside lives completely to cater to CVS, including missing family time, skipping lunch breaks and trying to get employees to drop out of school."
bad,could be better and co workers weren't very nice many people are very stuck up and talk about you behind your back...hard to meet nice so if you want to go to meet good people to work with keep lookin
bad,"I was treated very unfairly while working for this establishment,I was constantly harassed by management and employees about everything that went wrong. My personal opinion was because of my race."
bad,"Awful place. Like high school, cliques. High volume store, patient care calls are disguised telemarketing tactics. Lead technicians think they are ""management"", Favoritism rampant from management down"
bad,Awful company to work for. Treats employees unfairly and no sense of family or belonging. As time went on in my 4 years as management company only worsened. Fewer hours and low staffing are the norm and theft is a major issue.
bad,The company is always expanding and developing new products to support the health of the customers. It offers great customer service and reliability from the employees.
bad,"first job ever, and the worst job to ever work at."
bad,"One of the main problems with working for CVS is the pay, It is so not worth it if your looking for something long term but if your looking for some experience then it might be the job for you."
bad,"Management is not truthful with advancement. Non-supported, would give mixed messages about direction of department and would openly criticize workers."
bad,"Management sucks. A lot of favoritism!!! The pay was definitely not worth the work you put into it.. When the company changed over to CVS the benefits sucked. And they took away our shift differential. They say they have open door policy and understand about personal things at home, but they can honestly care less. If they like you they'll work with your schedule. If they don't you get the short end of the stick."
bad,"Corprate job, all about numbers, not about the customers, wanted more out of job. The company does not care about its employees. Happiness of our jobs is not necessary."
bad,I have worked for them for almost a year and a half. I was asked to go full time and have been working full time hours for almost a year without any of the benefits that I was promised.
bad,"you are overworked and underappreciated.  no one cares how hard you work, job training is a joke. every other person who works there is brand new and has no idea what they are ddoing."
bad,"I could go on and on and on but its not worth the stress. I'm such a fun loving people person and I just couldn't believe that this place that says they represent genuine care was a big lie. The other employees would get mad at customers. It is never their fault for being sick and moody, I'm sure your not a ray of sunshine when your sick. This job is truely amazing as long as you have the staff to back you. When your the only one caring about everything and no one else is in 110% is crazy. The register and the computer software needs to be redone. Computer are always going down. I always works over 40 hours and I hired as part time. The breaks for the front workers are different from the pharmacy. Soooo not fair they have more time. The best part of it all ... that got me through everyday was The Customers are amazing people, I love being around people just being able to help them, and to see them smile, i always looked forward to seeing my customers everyday, i know everyone by name and made tons of friends with the locals."
bad,I was very unhappy with this company.  I was treated awful and was not herd as a valued employee. They are all about number and not customers and it hurts.
bad,"This company was very problematic to work with. The store was chronically understaffed. This meant that you were typically called in early. 15 minute breaks were shunned, only 30 minute lunches were given, and your shift typically ended 1-2.5 hours after it was supposed to end. Not only this, but every day off I was given, I was called in. I was hired as a pharmacy tech trainee at minimum wage. After I received my certification, I had still not received any pay raise by the time I left two months later. The company itself gave me minimal training, and none of my coworkers were willing to show me anything because we were always so busy. I learned that I had to learn on my own and basically figured things out on my own. I saw on another post that gossip was prevalent, it very much is so, including among the pharmacists. "
bad,"Office staff are rude, no one is educate on home health, and how to provide bedside care to patient. Not a safe place for any nurses or patients to be."
bad,CVS is the most busy pharmacy to work at. Time passes by quickly due to the high volume of prescriptions coming in each day. You walk in with no management skills and by the end of the first month you know everything you need to on how to manage the place. Hardest part of the job were the customers. Nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,"they always work short handed, the customers like to yell at you and say that they will stop coming but they keep coming.it is very hard to get pay increase after passing pharmacy technician test."
bad,this company is no longer open. I was there when they shut down and only 7 people were picked to transfer out of 210 people. was a very mentally challenging job
bad,Did not allow us to have a lunch.  Made to much emphasis on customer surveys instead of filling rx's.  Did not give us enough technician hours to fulfill our goals.
bad,It's a terrible place to work. Some days I wouldn't get my lunch break. They talk down to their technicians and let the customers run all over them. This is a terrible place to work.
bad,The only way to advance here is to be best friends with managment. It also requires a lot of online training and tests and not just at the begining. you will constantly have to do tests and quizes no matter how long you work here. Compensation is not great its just average. And if you have a question the managemnet makes you feel dumb and they have attitudes if they think you should know already know the answer. It can make you feel scared to ask. They also hate to give you breaks because they dont want to come out of the office.
bad,angry cstomers all the time. poor conditions mean supervisors. pharmacy is filthy. had to clean up after staff and customers
bad,"The company is large but continues to run like a small mom ad pop shop. They take advantage of people in nursing facilities by over charging for medications."
bad,They continually cut our hours despite our rise in prescriptions being filled. It was honestly dangerous how extremely busy we were with little help. Pharmacist working 13 hours shifts without any lunch breaks is very concerning.
bad,"Fill prescriptions, assist customers at checkout check in warehouse orders, count medications. Customer service. Very busy envirnment filled prescriptions, was in drop off area as well as pick up typing prescriptions in"
bad,"None stop phones, and training only makes you so scared to answer the phones. The trainer are new too so its hard when they are learning to."
bad,way to much of a corporate style pharmacy. they dont care about their patients they serve or their staff. its all about numbers numbers numbers. everyone walks around miserable and hates being there.
bad,you never get your breaks and barley make it to get a lunch. it seems as tho all staff is used to not being able to take a breather and are used to holding it in when they need to go to the restroom.
bad,Horrible corporate systems who do not know what is going on AT ALL. Pay is not good for everything you deal. Benefits are not good even for full time. Miserable when there then also before you get there. Customers are extremely rude and nothing is done about it. Oh and breaks? Yeah they don't do thoses.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!
bad,Billion dollar corporation that does not give raises doesn't really care about their employees works you like slaves but pays little to nothing very cheap company
bad,Run you like dogs. Big suits come in and close down your office and walk out like it's nothing. No help with work. They walk all over you and kick you when your down
bad,The people who work for CVS are amazing. It's the management that gets in the way. Corporate makes it impossible to make a living wage and they will fire you for showing a hint of dissatisfaction.
bad,"is that they have multiple location. long hours. bad supervisor that provides no support and never is there."
bad,"The right place for the right time. Outside those parameters it's like a newspaper from two years ago - dead, useless and dirty."
bad,"This was the busiest job i have ever had, which is fine but it was a thankless never ending hourless job.  They did not care about their employees, and i was sad to leave but happier when i found something new."
bad,for as old as the women were they were very high school mean girl petty.  There were 5 leads to 3 employees and they were not an approachable group.
bad,Started off as a clerk and had absolutely no training. Management was awful and inappropriate. Was promoted to supervisor trainee position and left in that position (with all the managerial responsibility and never promoted to actual supervisor) for four months with ridiculous pay for the amount of work that had to be done daily. Eventually quit because you are required to do EVERYTHING within a short amount of time and no back up. Avoid working here.
bad,"Company I disliked working for the most! The lead Tech controls too many aspects of the pharmacy, at least where I worked. If you can, be patient and open with your availability."
bad,I worked for cvs for 1 year exactly and have never been promoted even though I have shown signs of tremendous leadership. Management has spoken to me numerous times about promoting me to manager but never did even though I was performing all of the manager duties and not compensated correctly
bad,Management doesn't seem to care for employees as individuals. Very disorganized. Shift doesn't end until all deliveries leave the building which wouldn't be a bad thing if 12 deliveries weren't tacked on right before your shift was suppose to end. Pam the operations manager is the only reason that place hasn't gone down the drain.
bad,"They promise you the world but give you nothing!. Two dats of training is the normal and there is a revolving door in the front, they can not keep help. The management is not supportive and have a sink or swim or mentallity."
bad,I learned a lot since it was my introduction to pharmacy. The work environment was fast paced but I was able to keep up. I met some nice people who helped me a lot
bad,Needs a union to fight for employees. They don't keep up with raises. Doesn't always give you hours. Will make you loose benefits if you dont make you fullyime set hours.
bad,This is a company that feel my children should not be priority if taken ill. They have a point system design to terminate people if take ill death  car broke down on the way to work there isn't any excuse....
bad,worst place i've ever worked. management is a complete joke. turn around for employees is so high there you literally see a new round of employees every month. but go ahead and apply find out for yourself.
bad,Unethical .... Lower managerment stick together to cover up bad pratice of company funds. So its very hard for higher management to investigation.  High turn over rate 3 -6 months top .
bad,CVS is known among the healthcare industry as a toxic company. CVS treats its employees just as it treats its members-disposable and replaceable.
bad,The worst I wouldn't suggest anyone going there you get treated with such disrespect you are replaceable to them even after all your dedication caused health problems from all the drama they dished out run far away
bad,Place sucks \. They only care about themselves. manager sucks and just care about herself. rude customers in that area waste your time for no reason. they have no morals on how to talk whatsoever.
bad,This isn't good company to work for they don't care about the employees they only care if the numbers look good I don't like it here but I have bills to pay and kids to feed
bad,Place was terrible. Employers were terrible. Illegally given no breaks on 12 hour shifts. Customers were terrible. very little pay and no room for growth.
bad,"worst place on the planet. DO NOT WORK HERE! barely any pay, long hours, everything is stupid. worst thing? if you show up or not you're not fired. great place for monkeys ou"
bad,"there isn't an option for negative stars so 1 will have to do , this is barely a company with no form of structure or training, completely on your own doing other peoples work with NOOOOOhelp from management."
bad,"Multi-task and prioritize customer needs to ensure 110% customer service."
bad,Everyone is overworked and techs extremely underpaid a tech makes the same money as a person who makes sandwiches and I'm sure they give better than cvs 10 cent annual raise. Upper management doesn't care and I'm talking about people on district. Can't find a cvs employee with anything good to say about the company and working there.
bad,they removed other department and only left  a refill department they removed room for growth.i decided that it was better for me to find a place where i can grow.
bad,"A typical day in the life of a pharmacy technician for CVS/Pharmacy is a major mistake. You will be underpaid, and treated like you don't mean anything to the company by your very own district manager. Nothing you do will ever be enough, and they will take advantage of you every chance you get. For example, if you ask for benefits like any other full time employee would, they will lower your hours to 39/40 just so you can't qualify. I loved my coworkers as we stuck together as a family; however, it was not worth the pain and tears working for a company who wanted nothing but money."
bad,This company has so many employee's that they don't know almost anyone's name. There is barely an opportunity to advance due to competing against thousands of employee's. This company is insensitive to their employees and their employees needs.
bad,"pay is minimum wage, full time is 30 hours, hours are not flexible-absolutely bad place to work. No real training except from pharmacist on occasion"
bad,Bad choice to accept job at CVS Health. Corporate office at Phoenix was the work location where I had the bad experience. No corporate work culture. Discriminated environment
bad,Recently resigned from this job because of the way I was being treated.  Was hired for full time.  Sometimes I worked 45 hours a week.  Sometimes I worked four hours a week.  Sometimes I didn't work at all.  I wasn't always given lunch.  The management of this company does not treat their employees very well.
bad,"This job sucks. The facility is filthy, dusty, nasty...they clean nothing. The management are a joke. The day one especially, full of mess playing favorites. Lack of training and support makes all the people go out the door. And some other things...healthcare unaffordable, incentives are non-existent. And oh yeah no support from upper staff when you need it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company!!"
bad,"If you have no life, family, friends, kids, not in school, and your looking to work your butt off all day and STILL not be able to leave on time, this is the place for you. The 1st thing they don't tell new hires is you have the same start time everyday but NEVER leave at the same time everyday. You can NOT leave until all of the prescriptions have been done for the day and that is at EVERY Omnicare worldwide. All of the managers in the Milwaukee, WI branch have NO college educations and know nothing about running a business. They have all been promoted into positions of management based on friendship and being with the company 20 plus years and FINALLY getting a management opportunity. There is no room for advancement unless you are best friends and suck up to other managers. You can type all day but if everyone is not keeping up or someone calls in your screwed for being able to leave at any reasonable time. A women even died of a heart attack while working there and they laid her dead body in front of the staff and told us that we had to keep processing away. Management is not understanding and treats you terrible. A guy I worked with there started going through depression over his dying parents that he was providing for and instead of them reaching out to see if they could do anything to help him they fired him and he committed suicide shortly after. They did not care! It is a extremely stressful work environment.  You are expected to be a human robot, not make any mistakes, and type a hundred prescriptions a hour and even if you do you still can't leave on time. As far"
bad,"This company needs a complete shake up, lacks the ability to communicate with their staff effectively.  it is 0 contract hours no mileage paid but they expect you to work from 6.30 am till 10 at night NOT GOOD COMPANY TO WORK FOR"
bad,"horrible place to work for, horrible managers , they open at 8 and close at 9 so you have to work 13 hour shifts not 12 ,,, they do not care about thier employees at all they care about the almighty dollars"
bad,"This was an awful place to work for, and i would never have taken this job had i known!!!! The Office Manager was very unprofessional, only good to her ""favorite people"", ignored new employees, very very poor training involved by the another order entry person that was put in charge of training. There was way too much favoritism!! The main boss who was never there, but if he didn't like you then you were non-existant! I hope when CVS takes over some of them lose their jobs like i lost mine!!"
bad,"they hired 30 people for 8 weeks  but most people got let go after 1 or 2 weeks because they ran out of money!!!"
bad,I would never work for this company how they terminated me and wouldn't recommend anybody to work for the company honestly.
bad,Not a great place to work if you want to grow up in your professional career. You have to be on your feet the whole time. Very much underpaid job for the work you do as a pharmacy tech.
bad,"Impossible standards and lack of help make for a dangerous work enviornment. A company that markets customer service above all else, but goes about it in the worst possible way by making the employees feel worthless and dispensable. An environment that treats the pharmacist with respect and offers the resources to provide success to the patients is the key to customer satisfaction, but CVS has the lock kept behind a safe of pure corporate greed."
bad,"You come in and work as a cashier, data entry and production.  You are bouncing around to different areas depending on if they actually hired enough technicians to work your busy store. I work for this company for 3 years, sometimes you don't have time to eat lunch.  In some CVS pharmacies you have no lunch break and eat standing up.  Management know's and will do nothing as long as the money keeps rolling in. They have a very high turn over rate because the pay is laughable and the work is hard.  They expect you to go above in beyond on pay that you can't even feed your family with while the company makes an unimaginable amount of money off of the work horses at the bottom of the food chain.  The higher up in the company you are, the faker you become.  The district pharmacy directors, the top managers, they're all the same.  They'd hustle there own mother's for a dollar bill.  Just use the experience and move on asap.  I've seen a employee (cashier) get robbed at gun point, the management told her to take 15 minutes to cool down and then get back to work.  They are pretty cold."
bad,Very rude and not flexible with schedule. Always short handed and wouldnt hire anyone else. The only good thing was the pay and that wasnt enough for things i had to deal with.
bad,"The work environment is terrible as management doesn't care for employees. Long pointless hours with no actual work to do, and cleaning during production time in order to prep for corporate visits. Employees are treated like children, very toxic leadership from the director down. Very unorganized and unprofessional."
bad,"My experience so far has been terrible. CVS has made so many promises to me but never followed through. I was hired as a Pharmacy Technician and was only trained for that position 3 times in a matter of 2 months. The manager was greedy and wanted me to be a cashier because he needed workers (because everyone quits). So I finally complain to my pharmacy technician teacher and she makes the phone call to my manager to find out he already changed my position to customer service without my permission. He also wanted to bump my pay down. I took the cashier position because I was forced to. Then I realised working as cashier for CVS means you have to do EVERYTHING at once. You have to stock, clean shelves, vacuum, do planograms, organize behind the register, put items back that customers didn't want all while ringing out customers and taking them to items and greeting and saying goodbye. The pay is absolutely embarrassing. Then I asked if I could be a shift supervisor when I saw my manager needed a new one and he said ""the process is easier for me to hire a new person rather than asking the district manager for a current employee to be promoted. So no."" Worst place I have ever worked hands down. No benefits, no room to advance, and treated very poorly."
bad,A self serving company that does not care about its employees and  customers. Stores are being cut back to skeletal crews with at times only one employee running store. Pay scales are being lowered and long term employees wages cuts and forced out as they try to build a part time only work force. They do not value their workers.
bad,"They promise one thing, and deliver something entirely different. Management was more concerned with throwing around buzzwords than addressing glaring scheduling issues. Hours were unreliable. Legality of their employment was questionable at best, given that we were told, explicitly, to say that we were ""Assistants"" rather than technicians, due to there never being enough pharmacists on the clock."
bad,They didn't want to give me benefits so they scheduled me for 38-39 hours a week and would get mad if I went over that time but would always want me to work. I would always even up working with co workers that didn't do much which made my work twice has hard. I never once got a break because this location was so busy we didn't have time or weren't staffed enough for one.
bad,"I worked at CVS health corporate in Northbrook, IL for a few months. In my first six weeks 5 people resigned from the team. The office space is over crowded and you are sitting on top of your neighbor. They cram several employees in small offices to save space. Employee moral is very low and most people are unhappy at work. There is no formal training and the expectation is that you teach yourself their system and way of doing things. There is simply too much to write about this horrible experience. There is a reason why this company has so many open positions...all the time."
bad,Stay away from this company.  Sub standard pay.  The bosses are horrible to work for.  Over worked and under paid sums it up pretty well.
bad,Its a lot of drama. The older people who been there prolly since the company opened are set in their ways they talk about each other then smile in each other face. Nobody like to help one another  they will sit there a watch you drown....Very Poor Management
bad,This is the WORST company I have ever worked for in my emtire life. You literally are just your employee number. They dont care about their employees at all you are just a warm body to fill a slot.
bad,Was in my first week of training and it was horrible. Other employees acted like they didn't have the time to show you the ropes. It was like pulling teeth!!  Never saw anyone smile or even communicate with each other.
bad,"The management is very unhelpful, the stress is very high. They say there is a chance for advancement and raises, but never saw one."
bad,"CVS compromises the health of their pharmacist and risks the health of their patients on a daily basis. Shifts are usually 12-13hrs. Your physical health is the least of their concerns as they don't allot a second in the day for meal breaks. If someone walks in wanting a flu shot and the person behind them wants to wait for 3 prescriptions you better set down that sandwich, wash your hands, and tend to the patients."
bad,"Sweatshop work."
bad,"The new hires are picked on, only get hours no one else wants to work, they tell you information about you being trained to be promoted and promote somebody else who has been working for them."
bad,Omnicare is so money hungry they could care less about employees. They are a multi billion dollar company and cut their worker pay by 4% because they said they couldn't afford to pay them. You are expected to stay until all work is finished even though you work on a team and there is a scheduled late person. Sometimes I would be in there from 7:00am-9:00pm. I have 2 kids and missed out on a majority of their life when I worked there. They have no respect for employees. I was actually told one time that I could go ahead and quit because they could get any monkey to do my job.
bad,"The atmosphere is very chaotic, there are not enough associates to serve the customers in an timely and efficient manner which just puts more stress on the associates workday"
bad,"I started working at a CVS Pharmacy in Pontiac, Michigan back around 2005. This store was about 45 minutes away from my house with light traffic. A friend's mom became the store manager and the store was a wreck. She needed good employees to fix the store's crippling problems that previous managers did not touch."
bad,"they were sued after i left for stealing money from is, i thinks that explains enough. They dont give raises and a lot of managers were fired for drug use"
bad,"They do NOT care about their employees. They put so much pressure on you. When they hire managers they do not hire any managers with any education, they just pick a buddy or a good friend and stick them in there. They are open 365 days a year. They dont care if you have family or other things. They only care about themselves."
bad,This place will drop you at anytime for no reason. Even the very best  top performers aren't safe here. will work you for every breath of your day with ridiculous hours for no incentives whatsoever.
bad,"Worked there for 2 weeks. Trained me for one week and then through me in the Easton office the next week by myself. The district manager is awful. She wants no change and They work with one computer and schedule 10 therapists, 2 doctors and 1 nurse practitioner out of a black scheduling book. You have no computer to schedule the patients to the Doctors or Therapists. It is a mess. The filing is atrocious. Then you have to call every patient for the Therapists to confirm the appointment and check their insurance every night. They expect you to come in early and stay late to get the job done, but refuse to pay you overtime. They are not nice people to work for. They pay awful. They are not up to date with computers or  office equipment its like working in the 1970's.   "
bad,"I really liked the job , I loved helping other people even more. I Just has my son which made my schedule completely different . I had no choice but to leave because they couldn't work with me."
bad,They Run There store as if u are back in high school again if u are not a part of the popular kids (employees) u get left out treated like trash and screwed any and every way possible
bad,No a good environment for people that want to help a company. No training is given by district managers.  The schedulers do not tell you anything unless you ask.  Good technicians
bad,The hardest part of the job was trying to provide excellent customer service by having medications ready in a timely matter and claims blocked by rejection for corp. office third party dept.
bad,"this company cares nothing for its employees, management is extremely disorganized and believes treating their employees like they are in a sweat shop will produce quickier results, They will watch how many times you use the bathroom, talk to your neighbor, get coffee from the breakroom and snack at your desk to increase productivity, no matter if you're sick, your mother is dying or your child is in need of help they will make you stay at work, your shift will be changed without your knowledge to day, evening or night shift whatever is needed. the office is always understaffed because they treat their employees so bad no one is willing to suffer for the pay they offer an hour. Anything you need to handle must be handled during your break even if your car has been broken into in their parking lot. If you have a choice in the matter please do not work here."
bad,"you are supposed to work 9-5 weekends off but they don't have enough people trained for every job. "
bad,Everyday was a struggle. Management would do NOTHING about careless workers who mess up nonstop. We were always short staffed.
bad,Working in the pharmacy requires a ridiculous amount of time put into classes and studying of store materials in your free time to be able to do your job well. There is no advancement. You can only move up one job position with very low pay increase and the benefits are abysmal. There is no reason anyone should work at a CVS pharmacy unless they are going to school to become a pharmacist. Otherwise it is not worth it.
bad,Understaffed and not well trained.  Technicians were transient due to the poor pay.Pharmacists generally would get burnt out in a matter of months because of the strenuous work environment  and ultimately find another job that paid less.  The lower pay made up for the amount of stress placed on the pharmacists.
bad,"i could not get away from there fast enough..I lost 20 lbs working. Good pay but was so tired from working, i could not enjoy. Stay away!!"
bad,The manger isn't the nicest person  and treats people like horrible! Someone needs to get him out of there or the place is gonna be run down to nothing. There isn't enough people working in the pharmacy . There always behind ! I've only worked there for a couple of months and have to give my two weeks notice because you/I get tired of being put down bye a manager who doesn't know anything about a pharmacy like he think he does
bad,"Pros"
bad,Everyone that works here is absolutely miserable I came in as a fresh excited new employee. The day I started I walked in an said hello to my co-workers and no one even looked up or responded. If you enjoy working in a highly hostile work environment with absolutely zero instruction or courtioursness. This is the place for you!
bad,"Longs Drugs used to be one of the best retail pharmacy to work for.  It's homey.  Employee discount was the best.  No compliant on employee benefits.  But, when CVS bought out Longs Drugs.  It all went downhill.  Everyone became grumpy and unhappy.  Many Longs Drug pharmacists left during the first year of take over."
bad,"being a senior employment means they can threaten you with your job and talk to you anyway they wont too. And when you talk to management about the problem they don't want to hear it or they don't care one of the too. And when it come to your rise its a 20 cents if your lucky, and then they act like they just gave that to you.But when they get there nice bonus off the work you did. The thing is corporate cant figure why we have a high turn over rate maybe they need to ask senior employees what the problem is and not management there ready too fire you because that makes them look bad."
bad,"Fast paced environment"
bad,"First off, if you like gossip this is the place to be. All the employees do is talk about everyone else. That's when they're not busy giving you an attitude. No one offers to cover shifts. If you do need to call out for an emergency, then you have to find your own coverage. Working 10 hours? Hope you only expect one half hour break. Standing for long periods of time, compensation is not worth the amount of work you have. Management is totally unapproachable. Not all the pharmacists, but most. Hired part time? Expect to work way over 30 hours a week but not accrue a single minute of sick time, vacation time or any other benefits. Expect favoritism. You'd like to work a morning shift once in a while but since other people conveniently complain and nag, you're stuck working all the late night shifts. You know, they're deserving to spend time with their families, but not you. Even after you've made several requests to have your hours cut or maybe stagger hours. Bottom line, I can't wait to find something new....soon."
bad,If you become your managers best friend you can enjoy an easy life watching other people work. Stay away from Omnicare of Moorestown. If you value family and your health. Otherwise your signing up for misery. The money well don't expect a real raise or job security. Unless you sell your soul. They will fire you for following procedures in ethics. Remember enron yeah the pharmacy version of that. To put it bluntly people that work there now would physically eliminate a member of your family and try to frame you. Sound like somewhere you want to work. I doubt it. Happy job hunting.
bad,I don't have any. its a great place if you want to be under pressure. I really don't know what else much to say uil igyhjb lhhyk
bad,"Long hours, no breaks, sometimes no lunches! Insurance sucks, pay is horrible and expectations from management are unobtainable and unrealistic!"
bad,"No Breaks, not clean, Not enough staff, need more on hands training not just online training, need better supervisors, need people in the company that doesn't just care about the bottom line"
bad,"A Typical day at work would be me basically running around like "" a chicken with its head cut off."" I was catching on fairly quickly just not getting the proper training while i was on the job. It certainly didn't help that my manager or ""lead tech"" was best friends with a co worker that wasn't fond of me. My grandfather had passed away during the four months i was at CVS, I missed approximately four to five days two of which i had a doctor note on hand. My co workers would use inappropriate remarks such as ""  I wish people would start coming to work."" Etc. I was informed that their would be a organization board filled out everyday for co workers to know what station to go and rotate throughout their shift that was never filled out until the last couple days i was employed at CVS. The hardest part of the job was basically getting familiar with the medication location. The most enjoyable part of my job at CVS was helping and interacting with people that were actually sick and needed help. Although it was difficult to deal with everything i learned a lot by working there."
bad,This company was bought by CVS health. After they where sold the company became a piggy bank for the huge company. The culture changed from caring about employee's to only caring about the bottom line. You cannot get promoted unless you are friends or family with management. The benefits are not paid for by the company the employees pay 100%.
bad,"The job here was horrible, I was treated poorly in every aspect. The management team was very rude and so were the pharmicists. I hated that there was never enough staff to get any work done."
bad,"Very fast environment always busy, the customers are tough to get along with and the staff doesn't make it any better. If you're going to work this job you're in for a rude awakening"
bad,Very easy and repetitive job. Worth the money and the hike to get to work through Providence everyday. Job was not challenging and the staff really didn't take the chance to get to know each other.
bad,"Very stressful retail pharmacy setting. Coworkers were not helpful, you're thrown right in.  Grueling training process. Very strict (and sometimes even vague) policies. Very disappointing management. Disappointing corporate assistance regarding employee rights."
bad,These judge you to see if you are stupid and they dont like they will fire you first three. CVS is bad. I had burnt my last employer bridges cause of these people. Now I am unemployed.
bad,"Day-very busy, hard to take lunch or breaks"
bad,Horrible management is horrible and they work you to death and you only have a good check if you work overtime and they gave you a five dollar gift card from target for xmas and a tin of stale cookies
bad,"Disgusting pharmacy culture, pharmacy technicians and other nonprofessionals direct pharmacists  what to do. Excessive amount of managers and other unproductive bureaucrats. Organisation structure remind me former Soviet Union before break down."
bad,Coram doesn't care about their employees. Too much micro managing. Have to ask to go on lunch and breaks like a call center.
bad,"I hated working for CVS Health. the management team was horrible. They expected you to know everything without training you or helping you in your learning curve. "
bad,"This place, i do not even have the words for it.  I ""moved up"" in the company at about an average pace for someone who learns at an average pace, and doesn't play around on the job. Overtime was all the time, and it was at least 18 hours a week, since I was on C shift, and added the optional 4th day on 10 hours shifts that for the most part were 12 to 13 hour shifts during the period of ""manditory overtime"" which lasted for about a year and a half."
bad,"Staffing company not very friendly or cared for their employess/contractors, had issues with payment from customer and had a very hard time from the staffing actually being paid for the time."
bad,"The whole managerial team and enviroment is a horrible combination. Power tripping managers who do not know how to speak to human beings. they have no respect for you or the work you do. Manager was known to leave work whenever , even during the busiest seasons. Very porrly run"
bad,Toxic work environment with frequent employee turnover.  Few processes documented; little infrastructure; poor leadership coaching and development; poor communication.  Compensation below competitive level.  Benefits expensive and poor.
bad,"It was not the experiences I expected. I was promised a job, but all I had was my jobs being outsourced to private agencies to increase profit. My manager was all about profit and not quality care. Patients had difficulties learning how to administer their IV medication in one day, but my manager would not permit f/u visit to evaluate learning. All to cut down hours. Medical Insurance was $6000 deductible under Coram/CVS. It was the worst time of my working experiences. I almost lost my house."
bad,"CVS does not care about their employees. I really loved my Pharmacy Manager, who really taught me alot and took us in like family. However, the company as a whole cares nothing about the people who work for them."
bad,"A typical day at work was very busy. I've learned how to be a pharmacy technician. Management was acceptable, but changed often. My co-workers were great people to work with. The hardest part of the job was not enough employees to handle such a high volume store. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer asked for me by name and only wanted my help."
bad,"They do not care about their employees or any type of problems. Lazy controlling coworker, won't train. Just stay away!"
bad,"I have worked for cvs for 14 years. In those 14 years i have seen and experienced a severe decline in the way cvs hold their expectations to individuals. Everything is to do with metrics and nothing on customer or employee safety or personal growth. I have worked at the busiest stores in my district (including busiest store in my region and one of the top busiest in the state) including challenge stores. I put customer service and their safety first. I enjoy a challenge and am comfortable in high stress hectic work environments. The hardest part of my job really just comes down to management and the conditions we were expected to work in. Within the last 4 years NUMEROUS pharmacists have resigned due to this issue, many of my own partners and colleagues including techs have resigned and gone to other chains/companys in hopes to find something a little more well managed. I am committed to providing good service and am extremely well at multi tasking and going from one thing to the next with ease in ease in fact, I rather enjoy it and am most comfortable in a busy setting but also don't mind a slower pace."
bad,"To start your training will be rushed rushed rushed,I saw them fire people that were not ""catching on""? It was the first week of training! You will have insanely hard to reach stats and zero time to get up to speed before they start with putting your job on the line. I was there a while and everyone that was or is still there only reached the stats in one way or another by cheating. You will always have a fear of losing your job. The first 6 months of every year be ready for hours upon hours of manditory overtime (say goodbye to your family for awhile). The pay and medical is horrible, yearly raises just forget about it. I had 3 straight years of no raise because the business had fallen off is what I was told but they pulled in 10-12 billion in profits every year? If you do get a raise its only 1-2% anyways which is next to zero. I honestly only stayed as long as I did b/c I had a great supervisor that would fight for you as much as she could. They left and so did I. I would honestly asvise looking elsewhere for employment. Starting pay sucks, medical sucks, the company overall is just horrible."
bad,"The way they train you will not keep people around. You can not throw someone on a job that wasn't explained or showed how to do. Then expect them not to mess up or just walk away from the job. Then have management watch every little thing you do just so they can correct you on how it should have been done,with no remorse that you are learning everything as you go. Always busy to the extreme( expect not to have any breaks but a 30 min lunch,if you are lucky to get that) with never enough people to keep everything flowing or even caught up. Expected that you should kill yourself everyday,not mess up, and have enough time to ask question because that wastes too much time having to do it the 2 time around. Bottom line is the company cares more about keeping a good name for themselves and less about how they treat the employees. If they have to hire someone new each week is fine with them long as the customers don't notice or caught on."
bad,Ok place to work. Nothing special. Can't expect anything! Work hard but 0 appreciation! Co-worker are fun to work with.
bad,worst management ever. stay away!! No work instruction! They don't care how hard you work. If you are not their friend or favorite forget it!
bad,I liked CVS while I was there but I got very little hours while I was there.  I only received 10 hours a week and that didnt change at all.
bad,"Poor management, Unfriendly co workers, Gossip, no raises ( I was there 3 years) Dirty and Dusty pharmacy. Short lunches. Poor training."
bad,"I have worked for this company for 2 1/2 years. They hire the most incompetent pharmacists. I was diagnosed with panic and anxiety disorders about a year of working there. And they don't take that into consideration. At my store, instead of rotating shift for everyone, some people get a set schedule during the day and weekends off. Therefore it leaves me and another person closing at nights, only 2 people close at night and weekends which it hard itself, covering all stations while people are still coming in with lines down the isles, and curved around the building at the drive thru. We are the only store in this county, so we are always extremely busy. But yet the company does not care. I have called the ethnics line and nothing still has not been done. I like what I do, but hate the company."
bad,"I feel they were training me as much as a pharmacist would be paid. But I would get a quarter of the salary. I do not care about working hard as long as I am appreciated and paid appropriately. They had me training at home on my computer more than I was working at the store. I am sorry but I would not work there again. Looking on line, there are many people who are dissatisfied with their job."
bad,"Extremely stressful, unforgiving. This company will do its best to prevent you from advancing. Work schedule is unforgiving to life events."
bad,"Horrible people are managing this pharmacy. Their main goal of management is to blame other people for any error that is made and to keep their own jobs. On my first day of training, there 12 people in the class. In less than 3 months, only 2 people from that class were still there (even the trainer is no longer there). After 3 weeks at this company, 3 different managers repeatedly bragged about how many people they personally have fired."
bad,I completed my internship here and they are extremely rude. The management sucks in the billing department. The workload was divided unfairly. there is a lot of favoritism there and nothing is based on work production or quality of work.
bad,"CVS is the worse company I have ever worked for. The company does not care about its employees. They do not have security, they try to get over on paying you what your due, and the management sucks. I would not refer anyone to CVS Richmond."
bad,"I left after 3 years because I was tired of being treated like absolute garbage. The pay was awful, the managers were mean, and there is no support. They are cheap, refuse your raises, and make empty promises. Stay away if you can!"
bad,"Learned how to work in a call center environment but management was very unorganized, no cleaning was done in the center, bug infestation."
bad,I would recommend anyone to work here. It is an unsafe place to work it gets robbed a lot and its not safe. I love the people i work with.
bad,This place is an absolute JOKE! You work extremely hard and work so much overtime and get ZERO appreciation!. The management is horrible. The company wants team work but its impossible when your management acts like dictators. Make sure you lock up your personal belongings! They might disappear! The workload is excessive and the expectations are well above company policy per technician. The good techs are being pushed out of the door. I would not recommend this company AT ALL!
bad,"From the corporate level to the management the ENTIRE company is unprofessional. Managers show favoritism and promote drama, no room for development, and being forced to work 6 days straight"
bad,"I'm know that there are some CVS stores that are ok to work for.  I went into this store with a chance to manage if I wanted to.  I said no until I could help get the place working.  The PIC that was there left for another company and a new manager came in.  We were typically 2 to days behind on refills with minimal help.  I helped the new PIC get us caught up for the most part although customer service was still horrible.  After patting ourselves on the back, corporate called and cut us back 75 hours and another 50 two weeks later. No need for me to stay with a company that only looks"
bad,"I hated this job, no work ethnic what so ever, but everyone is entitled to their own experience, but personally I do not recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"All the higher up people constantly contradict everything they tell, especially during a training, They will tell you one thing and then turn around and tell you the opposite. They set you up for failure"
bad,"Horrible place to work, every location is the same. No training, perks are not what you think. "
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked with terrible wages. Pharmacist get paid an insane amount of money while techs do a majority of the work and get paid 8/hr. While working for CVS, my store was  robbed 3 times and come to find out 90% of the CVS's in Indy have been robbed. They do nothing to prevent this from happening or protect their employees. This company only cares about the money and not their employees or  patient care."
bad,An exciting field  Management get you going team players who are focused on making it. Schedules  change frequently due to employees.
bad,"The place is very unorganized and messy I can barley move when I work. Customers and employees harass each other and myself. Worst customer service I have ever experience, employees are so rude to elderly people! I honestly feel embarrassed to work there!! Makes employees work 9+ hours without any breaks (including bathrooms breaks). Made me sign a agreement that if they don't let me take a break that it is my fault not CVS's. I am never been this depressed at a job ever in my life!"
bad,"HORRIBLE place to work! Management makes you feel incompetent. Like other reviews it's the buddy buddy system here if they don't like you, you are on your own and made to feel horrible about not knowing your job. Several write ups while I was in training for making minor mistakes, you would think that's where you are allowed  make a mistake, but not here! Constant emails letting you know that you made a mistake then when you ask for help all the responses are via email and the Sup is literally steps from you. Went to HR to make them aware what was going on but. Management already had a paper trail to cover their you know what. Who starts a job to think you would need to watch your back as a new employee! Before I left I still did not have everything set up at my desk, programs needed to assist patients. Sup on the floor always slumped down in her seat on phone texting, IM, ersonal calls then when you ask for help act like i was bothering her. Getting the jist? This company is a JOKE!"
bad,"Horrible place to work for!!!  They make you work like a slave without any type of appreciation. They're  benefits are suck. All you get is pto and one personal day, they don't care if you have an emergency or not you'll get points for calling out, coming 3min late or leaving early, I wouldn't recommend it"
bad,"Company seems to have a generally good agenda."
bad,Hostile work environment and lack of good organization Hour will change every six months . manangment bad  . co workers hostile toward new hires
bad,"long hours, not pay correctly , no time to see your family.anything is better than this place. you go in and are expected to say way past your shift."
bad,"My typical work day would start out either 2 ways, really good or really bad. They would never hire enough help for us to get our work done, yet we'd get in trouble when our scores weren't good enough for them."
bad,I think it is a very good company for young people who want to go to school and get some extra money in the time that they live with their parents
bad,"This is the McDonald's of Retail Pharmacy. Quick, cheap, low quality product, with poor customer/patient service. The employees are miserable too, but their stock is doing great so they must be doing something right. Right?"
bad,this people want you to work like professional but their pay is really bad for technicians I do not recommend work in this place this people has a lot of preference for those who like to lick the boss shoes not good at all.
bad,"Not all CVS stores are the same of course, but the one that I worked at and the couple that I trained at, they all spent their time gossiping about other employees and customers."
bad,"as you walk into work the pharmacist is the most rudest person ever she is really two faced. Then you have the customers who have their favorite technicians working there. They will give you a hard time because you are new. The pharmacist will not train you at any other area in the pharmacy. They will start you at pick up and once you master that you're stuck there.your pay will not go up, nor will you get good hours."
bad,"I've never worked for such a hypocritical company. ""Health is Everything""?! Yeah right. NUMBERS are everything, MONEY is everything. And patient care is only a priority if you get to it. Technicians are stretched out super thin, while hours continue to be cut. Upper management expects to do more with less. It's the corporate machine at the worst I've ever seen it! I was even assaulted by a customer, and my manager said and I quote ""What do you expect me to do about it? They're a customer"". Unacceptable. Technician to pharmacist ratios are not followed at all, sometimes even reaching 6,7 to one (If you're lucky, most busy stores are expected to run with just 3 techs on peak. are you kidding me?!) But that is easily overlooked because guess who is the president of the state board of pharmacy? A CVS pharmacist!"
bad,"Pretty much what you expect out of a faceless corporation. You start and they tell you that you're on a probation period where for about a month or so anything that happens to you won't get you in too much trouble because you are in training, but that quickly flies out the window when you think of considering bettering yourself and try and get ahead. They'll quickly pin something on you that you had no experience to handle in the first place so it can prevent you from getting a bonus or even getting out of your current position. They hire incompetent people to lead you and your team when they really don't know what they're doing in the first place. Management is a joke."
bad,"I worked at a perennially understaffed high volume store.  One week we were about 3 days behind on prescriptions, so the DM walks in and tells us the problem was our workflow and lack of focus on metrics.  It wasn't because our hours were getting cut left and right.  Then the DM gives us some suggestions on how to improve and leaves."
bad,not a well organized facility. the managers are not leaders. I was not trained well but thrown into the position. this place could really use a make over
bad,"retail system is only business oriented , schedules for pharmacist"
bad,Was not asked to do work hired for. WAS Placed in positions not trained for then told failed training period. I was hired a pharmacy technician in training but worked as a front store cashier.
bad,"Overworked underpaid, wasn't happy with the company overall. Not very understanding about family issues and having children. Manager was very moody and often rude."
bad,"high call volume"
bad,"Immediately after being hired I witnessed the most dysfunctional management system I have ever seen including dry cleaners and restaurants. As a result the employees and supervisors are unable to do their jobs and management's response for the three years I was there was ""we know"" and ""just do what you can""."
bad,A typical day at work was always busy. I was great at my job and loved my co-workers. Management was really not nice and they only cared about a body being there. They didn't care about the workers safety. I once asked for a back brace and their answer was we don't have those here. I also was terminated for leaving during nasty weather after making my number and working for 5 hours. I left for my own safety and a week later they came and told me I had no time to take off that I was gone.:(
bad,"Working at Coram is very fast paced, I have learned about many insurance companies verifying patients eligibility and benefit's. Coram services nation wide. Management is great and willing to jump in and help when the queue gets busy, as well as, great with Q & A. Very diverse company. Hardest part of the job is staying late, OT is not required but certainly appreciated. Most enjoyable part of the job is listening to my ipod when the queue gets busy and just focus on my task at hand. After learning insurance verification I was promoted to Sr. ASST. Test Claim Specialist, running test claims for part D payable drugs for home infusion."
bad,"Company on cares about their sales. They want to be number one, but they don't know how to keep their employees happy. I worked 12 hour shifts, with one lunch break. No 15 minute break, nada. I would work till I couldn't handle it anymore!"
bad,I worked with this company for over a year and was treated terribly. The first month was great - especially in a new store. But the management is not worried about their lower employers like cashiers. HR is just about worthless as well - and never follow up with any complaints. Had a supervisor who was making unwanted advances at other employees and HR never followed up with the complaints. Don't expect to ever get your breaks either - management doesn't follow the handbook unless they have big wigs in their store.
bad,I was only employed with CVS for 9 months.  It was a part time position while I finished my education at the community college.  I enjoyed meeting new people and filling their medications.
bad,Learned something new daily. Fast paced environment. Lots of structure. No problems meeting customers demands & needs
bad,"CVS is possibly the worst place I've ever worked. The management, from the top to the bottom, are completely unprofessional, demeaning and inconsiderate of employee work/life balance. I would never encourage anyone to work there, other than the free pharmacy technician training and paid national certification. Get in for those things then get out as soon as you can."
bad,"Maintained and organized store products in neat and presentable fashion as well as communicated with customers on daily basis regarding inquiries about products  Diffused and resolved various volatile customer situations while maintaining the balance between the interests of the company and customer satisfaction  Assisted with providing and recommending service options, and schedule installations for phone, television cable, and internet lines"
bad,"Your a pharmacy technician working with medication and you can barely afford to pay your car note off of what they pay you. The company is stingy and petty. They value the customers for the money but never the employees for keeping the customers happy. Big business chain, district manager and big wigs make all the money while they feed crumbs to the people actually doing the hard work.This company demands all your time and energy. They don't want you to go to school and better yourself because then you would leave. Don't expect anything good to come of this except experience in dealing with customers which can be good and bad like yin and yang.  This job is a stepping stone along the way. You can't make a career out of this unless you are top management. Not a store manager, I now actually make more than what there store managers do which is terrible. A cashier was actually robbed at gun point,nobody told the other employees, had to find out from a supervisor friend of mines,  the management only gave the poor lady 15 mins to recover from the robbery than told her to go back to work. This is very true story. CVS cares nothing about there workers."
bad,"The setting is casual along with the attitudes. This place was honestly a Mexican sweat shop with medicine. You will get no recognition and feel no sense of accomplishment working there. The management is no good and the people honestly do not get along with each other. You can't speak your mind or express your concerns there. If you do be prepared to get fired. Best to avoid this place and if you have to work at the sweat shop,  keep your mouth shut and wait for something better to come along soon."
bad,"toxic, back stabbing management, work overload, dwindling health benefits and no retirement perks. "
bad,"Horrible place to work, not sure how they are still in existence and have customers. They treat their employees horribly"
bad,was placed in the line of fire during training periods and placed in position was not hired for. A typical day was spent as a front cashier not a pharmacy technician  which is what I was hired to do.
bad,"could not get much out of working in a busy fast paced job."
bad,this was the first job I ever had. the only reason I stayed was because I loved my immediate supervisor and most of my coworkers. employees are way over worked and underpaid. overtime is encouraged during season but when off season comes youre lucky to get your full time hours (which youre supposed to be entitled to). no pharmacist has ever told me I couldn't take a lunch but there have been a ton of times where I was atleast given dirty looks for taking a lunch.
bad,This is the worst company I have every worked for. Starting from the management there is no structure. The turn over rate is very high  and there is no job security.
bad,"It was a ok company to work for, i learned alot. I loved my co workers and the people i met. A typical day at work was a 8-13 hour shift standing up, no breakes, we were always short staffed. But i enjoyed the work none the less."
bad,"High volume, fast paced environment."
bad,"During the interview, I asked for 35-40 hours minimum. While I was not promised that, I was also never made aware that I would seldom, if ever, get that many hours. Now I'm looking for a 2nd job to help pay bills and manage."
bad,Youre on your feet all day with no break. The company promises you raises that you never get. The typical day at cvs is crazy when you walk in and crazy when you leave. You never get help because the company would rather have you do the work of three people than hire enough people to get the job done. If you are looking for a job where you get burnt out cvs is the perfect job for you. Oh and the benifits are horrible.
bad,This is company that mainly cares about making profit and does not show any appreciate to its employees. Definitely not a company to  work for as a pharmacist.
bad,Never enough hours to have enough people to work. Wanted excellance customer service but would only allow one manager and one cashier working a shift. The pharmacist would pick and choose what medication they wanted to keep stocked so that caused a lot of problems with customers.
bad,I did not like the job. You have to cram to much in one phone call. when the customer was clearly done with their purpose of the call. Management wanted to force more information on the customer and thus irritate the customer. Management didn't seem to know answers to questions as well. Just a overall not a good place to work but what made it bareable was the co workers around me.
bad,"the company only cares about the bottom line, computer system is antiquated, the morale of the workers is very negative, no advancement opportunities here, the pay is low, very small raises, there is nothing positive about this workplace"
bad,"the job was alright, the customers were generally nicer than expected, and the hours were odd, but the coworkers were unbelievable, fights in front of customers, attempts to shift blame if criticism was offered, and outright scapegoating for anything that went wrong if they were not present at the time."
bad,"I have been working  in the Lincoln, RI corporate office for some time now.  In this time I have worked very hard and been a committed and loyal employee, busting my buns to improve the day to day functionality.  It has been very clear for quite some time that 1) this company is still very behind in times, with little technical advancements, wasted time and money. 2) values employees who have neither skill or experience in what they are doing 3) sneaks around rather then being honest and upfront.  There are some snakes in this place and by some I mean 90% of the people I have had to work with.  This place is filled with laziness and liars - people who take credit for the work others do and leaves lots of room for paper pushing, those are the people who don't actually know/want to do their work so they throw fits and pass their work off onto others.  Superiors that do not know the positions under them that they are responsible for and do not care to understand cannot make things better, so while they are running around micromanaging people who are getting quality work done and meeting deadlines all they do is cause chaos.  Such a frustrating place to exist especially when ethics do not exist.  This place is absurd, keep looking any other company would be better then this.  Your talents and skills are worth more then this place will afford you, respect yourself because these people won't respect you."
bad,Understaffed and over worked with very little chance for career advances. Low pay for the amount of stress that comes with the job.
bad,I have worked in the Health field for over a decade. I have worked for 5 companies in that time. None have been as bad as Coram HC. I have worked here for 3 years and I regret everyone. The company got bought by a HUGE company CVS Health. Then they cut our benefits raised the price for the terrible benefits. The cost of benefits for a family of three is $1150 a month! They have plans that are cheaper but you have a higher copays and less coverage. The cheapest plan with cut rate insurance is still $740 a month. The company has changed my review period 5 times in 3 years. So I never get a full year review. So they can Pro Rate my 2.5% raise. Don't work here unless u are right out of high school or college. Then you can learn where not to work. The people working there are really nice. Management is detached and doesn't know what any of the common people have to deal with.
bad,"Management was very unprofessional. They call employee to take smoke breakers. Nothing you send was very held in confidence , management was worse then employees."
bad,"not a good company to work for- they do not care about anyones health, only their bottom line - the higher up the ladder, the higher the salary - admins to them are expendable"
bad,"CVS is a company that thrives on exploiting their employees. My reason for saying this is that in the 7+ years I have worked for the company, my ending salary was a meager $12/hr. In fact, at the time I was leaving the company I had obtained my college degree and had applied to higher positions that I was sure to be a shoe in. Sadly, upper management did not want me to leave the store I was at due to me being the most productive employee who had turned the pharmacy department's performance around. They did very little to recommend me for the higher position after telling me they would."
bad,"The job is not all that wonderful, they  require to work in horrible weather conditions and if you are unable to make it, it will result in a right up."
bad,"a great place to get experience"
bad,"Micromanagement and mismanagement to the maximum. Constant harassment to get on the phones even when you are already on the phones. The job itself can be stressful especially depending on which department you're in and dealing with customers/patients has it's ups and downs but that is a given in any job environment. What makes CVS Specialty Pharmacy at Mt Prospect so horrible is the management and supervisors inability to work with their teams and create a good working environment. Instead of easing and helping out, they make it a more difficult environment to work in despite the job itself being stressful. Management, supervisors, and team leads work together to add an additional, unnecessary stress to the job. Coworkers are okay, it just depends on your department but in general, the entire branch is very unprofessional and inconsistent in their policies and procedures. If you're on someone's good side, you're fine but you basically have to watch out for peoples' moods to see what kind of day it will be at work. Despite the difficult patients, they are the best part of the job which really goes to show what type of place this is to work. Efficiency and hard work is not rewarded nor recognized. One good thing about the job is that you get two breaks but even that, management does not approve your breaks unless there are no calls in the queue, despite the fact that there will always be calls waiting because it is essentially a call center. The one good thing about the job they ruin by mismanaging and micromanaging, once again."
bad,"Typical day usually starts with doing a cycle count on the entire pharmacy, and checking the voice mail to make sure that all refills have been processed. Overall the people that I worked with were okay. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to figure out an insurance problem."
bad,"This is not a company I would recommend to anyone, it is a culture of fear and intimidation with unqualified individuals running each area of the business."
bad,"Traning only last for two weeks, They expect you to get it after that, and I believe that it should last for two more weeks. Friendly people to work around. They go through Contractors, so they can let you go any time, so beware, they might seem friendly but if you can't make it on the floor they will let you go. They told me that I was good on the floor and the next day the contractors call me and told me that the company let me go, so beware of Contract Jobs"
bad,Very busy work days with processing prescriptions and keeping accurate records.  Always a joy providing great customer service and making a difference in the world with keeping people healthier and living longer lives.
bad,"I have seen many people leave this company, because the work load is too much and the ""Consultants"" are paid as if they are managers so they don't get over time. They treat contractors that they hire with disrespect, and if they terminate a contractor they either give you one day, or wait until you gone home to terminate you."
bad,"See Richmond, VA review (1-12-15)...Worst job ever!!!!"
bad,They didnt really help with anything they didnt really help with anything they didnt really help with any thing they didnt help with anything they did not help with anything.
bad,"Horrible if you can put up a year of this filth fest of a job, do it and move on."
bad,Very hard company to work for. Continual turnover and process changes.
bad,Being employed at Cvs as a cashier you must socially be active with customers which can bring its own benefits with the public. You can tell when a customer is feeling social active or not interested in any of the daily advertisements. Usually its the responsibilities of my managers to announce special events. I feel that more communication with the sales team is more effective but my thoughts don't matter. I enjoy cashiering and staying involved with customers needs while shopping.
bad,"the manager overlooked obstacles, the supervisor entertained drama and never worked. all in all it is not a good company to work for . it was a cycle of bull . if you had issues you may as well keep them to your self because they would go unsolved. there was alot of favortism they played a role with the supervisors that the manager would overlook."
bad,"Very Unprofessional with no advancement, someone starting off will be at the register until someone else is hired, co-workers are difficult to work with, and poor pay, best part of the job is the clients and their stories. A typical day at work would be getting my coat on, punching in, and filing prescriptions, and waiting on customers. When there is no more prescriptions or customers, you twiddle your thumbs because your not allowed to do anything else even when your done your training. You have to accumulate 500 hours in order to be registered and take the test to be certified. Management does play favoritism towards co-workers, allowing them to call in whenever and take half days to go to the doctors whenever they choose.I had to call out once because my children were sick and I got a lecture. Not an ideal place to work."
bad,I would stand for 8 hours a day and ship meds to people who needed them. I also scanned the bar code into the system and it would print label and then i shipped them down the line. I also build pallets and placed the boxes on the right pallet.
bad,This company has a tendency to talk about big things when it comes to hiring an individual but does not actually live up to the expectations they set for themselves. The workload is extreme with no balance from those in higher positions attempting to help relieve these kinds of problems. The employees are hard working individuals  who often sacrifice a life balance just to help the company but the company gives nothing back.
bad,"Former employee: they treat you like a dog don't care how good of job you do?? The management sucks, if you don't play with the bosses you lose???"
bad,"They not only are completely disorganized, but they hire anyone and Everyone who applys, making it harder to actually shine in a work environment when you feel like your possible future ""Supervisors"" don't actually care about anything besides themselves. Also they have Brand New people do the training thus making it impossible to actually know if you are learning everything like you are supposed to because they don't even know what they are teaching you."
bad,"Weekdays are virtually non-stop with the phones ringing, patients coming in looking to fill prescriptions, and trying to maintain between 3-6 tasks at any given time. Between the hours of 9-6, it is just pushing to try to keep up with the workload."
bad,"The company is not bad to work for but btwn management and the DM, they suck and make your life a h***  I worked there over 10+ years and nothing has changed management wise.  The DM I had was a straight butt-hole and if he hates you there is no room for advancement AT ALL.  Ethics codes are not used, these managers take advantage of this especially the ones that know the DM will always side with them.  If the manager/DM want you gone they will together try everything, and if they're unsuccessful they will definitely make you so uncomfortable.  Managers change people times so they don't go over in hours, CHECK YOUR TIME SHEET and THE APPLIED OVERRIDES.  And forget about your family, they are of no importance to this company.  I could write a book but I think this is enough, I would never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,You get good benefits. A lot of nice customers. The management is good but a work in progress.
bad,Horrible place to work if you have disabilities!!  Unless you want to do the work of 10 employees at once I would not work here.
bad,very illiterate people managing the company specially the coordinators. Have no sense to talk to employees.Very disrespectful management.
bad,"It's extremely difficult to get paid, getting hired takes weeks, there is no good/steady management, always understaffed, no sick days unless you have a doctors note and many other things wrong with the company in general. I would never recommend working in the pharmacy to anyone."
bad,Repackaging 100 boxes of CVS merchandise per hour into smaller quantities to be put into totes for other departments to pull for store orders. Very physical and tedious position standing on feet for all of shift.
bad,supervisor take looooong smoke breaks with their friends and leave 1 or 2 employees to do the work
bad,"If you're reading this job posting, go back and click on something else.  This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for.  Most of the Co workers were fun to work with but management absolutely sucks. They do not care about their employees or their families and there is no room for advancement.  If you report something,  they will retaliate against you and you will be out of a job.  So unless you want to work in a place full of drama and BS, move on.  Omnicare is not the place to work."
bad,"did work for cvs for over 10 years, They have gotten away from caring for the customer but caring for the customers wallet. Now with annoying phone calls on a daily basis and being rated by a customer if they want to take a script or not. Its a horrible place to work, they always cut hours when possible. When I worked getting raises use to be at 5% a year and that was alot back then, now its 1%, 2% and if our lucky 3%. Yet CEO always got a huge bonus. Do yourself a favor and look at other pharmacies first. And always read the reviews ;)"
bad,"I feel the management , the CEO and the board of directors at CVS Health make it very clear that the health of their employees means absolutely nothing to them."
bad,"customer service & sales driven weekly ad they demand each staff member to push sales when you are in a customer service roll. "
bad,The CVS pharmacy in which I worked was ridiculous! Bad management was the daily norm along with blantant favoritism! If you were not liked by the pharmacist then you need to start looking for another job  because she will find a way to get rid of you!
bad,"If you care about your health , Don't work here ! This job is by far the most hectic, stressful job ever! I've worked for this company 8 years and this use to be a good place to work for no one can handle it anymore! ..a technician will not last more than 2 months that's why cvs is always hiring. It is to be a great place not anymore!! They put way to much pressure on technicians. Insurance sucks!! No good benefits even though we are health care! ! All they care about is their numbers !! Please do not work for this company for your sake !"
bad,"long work hours with little pay, no room for advancement. pay is not comperablt to others in area."
bad,"This is honestly one of the worst companies I worked for. There was never enough back up, constantly had to take my breaks late or skip them altogether because nobody was capable of performing my job, while I had to serve as every department backup without a promotion or a raise. They have a lot of class action laws suits because of these issues. They fired half the staff every year when they got a new store manager and the managers who had been with the company when it was Save-Ons was let go and replaced by incompetent individuals who were unable to perform their job function or was never at the store period."
bad,Omnicare pharmacy is a joke. Management is even worse. The pay sucks there are no pros to working for this company. There is no proper training and everyone is out to get everyone. People are quick to throw you under the bus. If you speak up for yourself and don't tolerate the B.S people target you. You have to be a brown noser in order to keep your job and have job security. There is always MANDATORY overtime and if you can't work overtime because of school or family they don't care.
bad,perfect place if you want to be overworked and underpaid! always understaffed...advancement is more about friendships with upper management than performance.
bad,"You will be written up and terminated for anything so they can replace you with a cheap new Grad or a cheaper Egyptian pharmacist. Management comes up with new ways to anger you and take family time away completely. You have to turn away all controls and send 80 year old patients packing because they take a lorazepam. New SPLIT SHIFTS make in mandatory you're driving to CVS about everyday to suffer. Vacations are only given to people going to their home countries, so if you're American then don't expect any real time away. There is no employee representation above store level so don't think HR will help solve the many unethical scenarios you will be encountering. If you apply here I hope it's a last resort."
bad,"Always understaffed. Always two steps behind."
bad,"total disregard for individuality or creativity. They want personalityless clones who blindly follow, without space for creativity or improvement."
bad,If you like working with out being acknowledged and low wages this is the place for you
bad,"Omni-NO-CARE!!! Is the worst job I've ever had. Things were exciting and going good in the beginning until I started to get harassed by the lead technician, every other week she had a problem with something that I did and or didn't do to her likings. She would run to management and they would have conferences with the both of us and of course ""she was always right!"" They can careless if you have children/ families.  So unless you're single with no children,  run as fast as you can."
bad,"Typical day starts off with customers waiting in drive-thru before the store opens. This particular location does about 80 scripts a day (if lucky) but some days much more scripts are done this is a bad thing because the least number of scripts produced means less number of hours to give for the work schedule so the pharmacy ends up short with help. Even if the pharmacy is not busy its difficult for a one tech to work because many pharmacist work under the ethic that pharmacists are expeted to fill scripts and consult customers nothing more, no helping ring out customers no taking out trash no refilling labels, no filling scripts no nothing to help make job most efficient for technicians."
bad,Poor leadership and management.  The product offering is all smoke and mirrors
bad,"In the time I spent with call center, I managed to better understand Rx benefits. Handle irate calls. However, accomplished this challenge by trial & error. No sup support. Also, sup knowledge was below standard. This would explain why sups, when asked for proper talk-offs, would hide in their offices."
bad,"use you up, then spit you out. hire the next person in line. worse place I have ever worked."
bad,"Disorganized, chaotic, irate employees and customers. One thing I took from my experience here is how to multi task rapidly while keeping everyone happy"
bad,"Don't wast your time.. This company is a sinking ship.If you want to be treat horrible apply for Omni who cares. If you want to  receive POINT instead of bonus apply here. They give you POINT for family emergency,car accident,...but they will excuse if your boss likes you. The management wont do any thing. They just walk or sit in their office and talk about football. HR wont care about your concern, poor poor poor management.  Some great workers but worse management you can ever seen. They will treat you badly if they don't like you, it doesn't matter if you are a great employee. All is matter is if they like you. Im looking for a job."
bad,EHH i wouldn't recommend it. more work then what they pay you t do.
bad,"Worked here only for a short period of time and was glad to leave and see the back of it!!! "
bad,Efficiency and diligence throughout the day. Specialty drugs for mail order patients
bad,"A typical day at CVS would consist of providing customer service, handling several calls all day on multi-line phone systems, multi-tasking, whether it be on 2 computer screens, insurance claims while doing another job, and assisting the pharmacist.  While at CVS I learned how to do scheduling, maintain great customer service scores.  The hardest part of working at CVS is making sure every customer leaves with a smile no matter the circumstances.  The most enjoyable part at CVS was the coworkers.  We all worked as a team, providing the best care we could, and making sure every need was met."
bad,Don't Waste your time.Long hours. Bad pay. Inept management.
bad,Extremely stressful environment and very poorly paid. You get no breaks or lunch breaks throughout the day. Management is terrible.
bad,This company is a sinking ship.  Their managers just sit in their offices and don't follow up on issues at nursing homes.  I was laid off because I was very scared to lose my job.
bad,"Management is horrible and expects high numbers for customer service while cutting hours and providing little training to their employees. Focus is not on dispensing medications correctly or health of customers but making customers happy, which involves filling C2 scripts that you may not feel comfortable with. Management will support customers who demand their oxycodone rather than the pharmacist's license."
bad,"The 2 years I spent with omnicare was nothing short of awful. I was harassed because I had kids. I was denied days off while pregnant for doctors appointments even when I let them know a month a head of time. The general manager was a terrible person. Very unprofessional, rude, inconsiderate, swore a lot and deemed it necessary to harasse me daily. I won't play victim here she hated everyone and I feel she should NOT be aloud to work with the public or people in general. She was very aggressive and angry. She belittled people constantly in front of everyone. I'm not to sure how omnicare is still running and or has any business in my area because of this women. The pay was not worth dealing with her attitude alone. The benefits were ok. And most of my,co-workers despite working in such a hostile environment were awesome to be around. But all in all I would advise people to not work there. Its poorly run and not worth it at all."
bad,"I have worked for numerous retail companies,and I have never been as stressed overworked or under paid in my life. Managers don't comply to availability and they talk to you like your an idiot. If you think about taking breaks at this job you can forget it. You will work straight through your entire shift. The starting rate isn't worth all the work that you do in a day. If you are a Pharmacy Tech Trainee, will pretty much do everything while the Lead Tech and Pharmcist bark orders at you. The customers are very demanding and rude at times."
bad,CVS has helped me reach my level of enlightenment in the Medicare field
bad,wroking in cvs was not good the company hire lazy management ..
bad,"If I can help it, I will never work for CVS Caremark again."
bad,Do not work at kingstree store. Customers are very Rude. The pharmacist does not give you credit for anything and always throws you under the bus.
bad,"Typical  day is like 10-13 hours a day."
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy technician for them for 2.5 years making $9.00/ hour. They treat you like scum. After they found out they were breaking the law with my part-time status as 40 hours a week with no insurance and benefits, I was dropped to 29 hours. I ended up walking out on a Monday afternoon. They talk about you, accuse you and have their priorities totally backwards. For example, in my store that I worked out, someone stole a bottle of 500 count Lortab, and CVS asked the technician to get rehab but no charges were pressed. Another tech didn't put an employee sticker on a $1.71 Pepsi and HR came into the store with Loss Prevention fired her on the spot and charged her with larceny. They don't care about you or your life. Job security there is pathetic and non existent. If I could rate CVS in the negative I would!"
bad,"After the few years I spend at CVS I realized 1 particular thing, CVS only concern is getting enough money to build more locations rather then concentrating on the employees and our feelings, nothing is done as a team everything is for yourself."
bad,"I've worked for Cvs for many years, unfortunately. The pay is ridiculously low for what you have to go through and the stress that you have to endure. I work in the Pharmacy and you're constantly beat up by customers. Management doesn't care, anything to please the customers! This job has actually made me not like people. To Cvs, you're just another number. No matter how hard you work or what you do, it always goes unnoticed. They ""try"" to start new things to recognize employees. How about start with paying your employees a little better. Cvs is the lowest paid retail pharmacy for pharmacy technicians. I could go on and on about how much I dislike this company and how I can't wait to find a different job. Bottom line is, I NEVER recommend anyone to do this job. If you don't drink alcohol, you will probably start after working at Cvs!"
bad,Did not like it all. Mangement was really poor. And awful benefits.
bad,"This has been the most unorganized company I have ever worked for. The billing supervisors, along with having no advanced education, haven't a clue about the billing process. You are micro managed, required to work overtime to the point of exhaustion. There is no work/life balance; management simply does not care if you pass out at work as long as your work is completed and you cannot leave work until it's completed. Billers are overworked and underpaid; and because the company is not technologically advanced, the amount of paper that is used is ridiculous."
bad,"Preparation of documentation for billing of medicare. Customer service,"
bad,"Love the people I work with but not a good company to work for. They start you off at a low pay, do not give you raises on time. There is no room for growth. Raises are about 25 cents. If you go to management for a problem like your yearly raise they will say I will get with you and never do. You have to keep reminding them. They will not work you 40 hours and keeping cutting your hours, yet, they keep hiring more people."
bad,"They are a cheap company that only offers their employees part-time positions. They don't offer any benefits for their part-time employees, no way to advance, no insurance and barely have hours to give out yet they keep trying to hire people. Many people they hire end up quitting because they not only pay minimum wage basically, but there are no benefits to having a job at CVS besides getting discounts on their products."
bad,"District manager's and above want you to write everyone up on anything so that they will have a file and terminate employees at will.  Do not care about patients, oh! sorry, customers.  Don't sell cigarettes, that's ok, I'm only here to buy beer and weight loss medicine so I can get my heart attack going.  They want everyone to do the job for 3 people.  All about profits and not people.  Terrible chain that reminds me more of the conditions during the Industrial Revolution.  RUN AWAY!"
bad,"OCR demands a lot from their rank and file employees but do not give a lot in return. The saying is, ""Yes, the pay is bad, the hours are long but the benefits are non-existent."" I could add ineffective management, utilizes resources poorly and destroys employee morale. "
bad,"No place for advancement. no benefits, Hours are cut in the winter time."
bad,"Like most corporate companies, CVS is a terrible place to work. Staff is always treated like slaves and the company has no interest in making their employees feel appreciated."
bad,The senor management that I worked for made my life miserable. My coworkers made my days worth coming in.
bad,"I have never in my life worked in such an unprofessional place. The constant bickering between pharmacists, technicians snapping and the turn over rate has made this the most unpleasant work experience. Don't let me forget the uncalled for cut in hours of over half the employees except for a few ""favorite"" technicians. Went from 40+ hours to a mere 16 hours. Be good to yourself and stay away."
bad,i didn't like working here at all management was awful very unprofessional and unorganized
bad,The CVS I worked at was horrible. There was no teamwork and management was horrible. Made me wait over 2 weeks for my final pay. I highly suggest not working for this company
bad,inbound calls about patient meds. had to set refills up or talk to patient about their benefite\s
bad,"Just work for them for one week and you will know, stupied management, using a one star rating is too generous for this company."
bad,"If you want a good summary if this job, just sit down and watch Office Space.  Careless management, micro managing, stuffing the employees face full of junk food and having things like ""Hawaiian shirt day"" so it makes the environment seem a little less awful, and finally pushing employees to the brink of insanity.  The pay is pretty decent, but after your 60 hour a week shift (including weekends, which once upon a time we had those off) it rounds off to about 10 dollars an hour.  Like New Years Eve/Day?  You'll be working instead of celebrating.  You get a bonus once a year, if that, don't move on to another opportunity because you won't get what you earned if you leave.  Positive reinforcement and encouragement are a foreign concept to your management - especially if they are racist and call you a ""dumb white girl"" within earshot.  I stayed with the company longer than I should because of the fantastic benefits package - which is now an HSA plan - meaning you pay 100% of your services and get a tax write off at the end of the year - so now your ER copay is 2000 dollars instead of 50 (and yes, they blame Obama and lobbied millions to get ACA overturned).  "
bad,"Its a mass production type of atmosphere. Overtime is allowed, which helps."
bad,work at CVS/Caremark was managable not enjoyable. If you were looking to move up or grow within a company this is not for you. Management was shoddy. Not one manger knew how most of our operating systems worked. If you wanted a pay increase a raise to a decent amount would take you years on end. There are no pros to joining CVS/Caremark. No matter how good of an employee you think you are this place will make you seem like you are nothing.
bad,Most of the staff are nice.  Very hard to get the Manager on the phone and she rarely returns missed phone calls.  One of the supervisors is pretty rude and blunt and can be quite unhelpful. No ongoing training and very little phone support.
bad,"Management and staffing problems."
bad,"Where to start? I hate going to that place everyday, couldn't enjoy my off day because I knew I had to work the following day. They play favoritism it's the only way to move up in the company. The supervisor are not trained. They know less then the representatives. Their attendance policy is to strict. No positive feedback just negative. The pay for a call center is low. Anything you don't want from a job this place has. I say RUN!"
bad,"Stressful work environment"
bad,not professional at all. manger treat you and kind of way do take the time to train the new hires
bad,"The worst company ever to work for. They only care about money and making things as bad as possible of the employees. I worked in the pharmacy as a certified pharmacy technician for 8 months and they were the worst 8 months of my life. The customers are all mean, rude, lazy, and entitled. The managers were very friendly but over the 8 months a number of different policies where enforced by the company that made job conditions unbearable. They make you come to work no matter how sick you are, which is very dangerous when your dealing with elderly customers all day. CVS is also the least paid pharmacy technician job there is. I was certified and still started at $8.10 per hour."
bad,"The actual job is rewarding considering your helping people with important matters, however, the company is terrible. Favoritism is very bad with this company."
bad,This company is so racist I wouldn't recomend anyone to work there. the employes are immature as well. I'm thankful I'm no longer an employee. and the company doesnt pay well
bad,This company is terrible! They lie to their employees and are taking away their benefits. They are firing everyone including supervisors. Moral is so low and there is no one that feels happy or secure in this job.
bad,this job is for people that like woring at a fast pace.It was a great place to work at.
bad,"Poorly managed. No job security. Everyone will throw yo under the bus. The work was easy, but most did not know what they were doing. I have never see a work environment anything like this place. They should pay more for all that they require. Constantly changed the work schedules. Also, add drama created by employees, very much like high school. Unnecessarily stressful environment."
bad,Do not work here ever unless you like forced slavery built around mental manipulation and subversion.
bad,CVS does not provide their employees with the necessary tools to be sucessful.
bad,"Horrible...Horrible...Nightmare work place, zero raise, no life. KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."
bad,Highly over worked employees and very underpaid. Management is very cruel and demeaning.
bad,Favoritism! A lot of people not working and breaking the rules but you can't unless you're cool with management. Discrimination here is a understatement. They micromanage you until you're dust. Huge turnover rate! They will use whatever they know about you against you to manipulate you. Coworkers are like high school students and will spread lies about you to management. RUN AWAY!!! Been there for serval years and glad to finally be gone!
bad,Hours were always shorted. Schedule was always changing due to being open 365 days a year. Rude customers and management.
bad,"Don't believe these great reviews printed here. I know that its just cvs managment hacking into this site to boast the morale. This is a terrible place to work. Type in CVS is.. into google the first hit is ""cvs is hell"". I had to get out while I could and take a paycut. People don't get lunch breaks and don't get paid for working extra. The manager will hack into the payroll and deduct extra hours you  work. CVS managment is complicit in this because you used to get a print out of when you clock in and out. They stopped doing this for a reason so people wouldn't have proof that they weren't getting paid for working extra which is a necessity in the pharmacy. There is no way a pharmacist can fill 400 plus scripts daily with 2 or 3 techs and meet all of the demands of making the marketing phone calls and getting the numbers cvs expects without someone working overtime. I even came in off my vacation to make stupid express scripts calls. If you don't know what I'm talking about consider yourself lucky."
bad,"As my first pharamcy tech. job I was excited, But as I started working there everything started to unfold. There is no training what so ever! They just threw you in  there with a blind fold. They just tell you how they operate and how the backend works and they provide a small tour."
bad,A typical day at work is to be constantly harassed by your manager who tells lies about you and is always threatening team with layoffs.  This of course leads to a very stressful work environment.
bad,workplace is dirty others employee and employer don't respect your privacy nor space.
bad,Everyone is indisposable. The co-workers were great however the company itself and your higher ups were always rude and do not care about employees.
bad,Nothing good will ever come out of CVS and I would advise you never to work there.
bad,Cvs pharmacy does not care about there employees. there is no room to grow or advanced with the company. This is the worst place i have worked for.
bad,not a good company to work for if you are trying to have a career.
bad,"Worked 8-10 hours a day, handled customers under various circumstances, management was extremely poor and unorganized, the company all around is poor and doesn't deal with employee problems/concerns, co-workers were extremely demanding and asked for things outside of the job, the hardest part was dealing with the employees and the problems that were not solved through human resources, the most enjoyable part was helping, being around, and talking to the customers."
bad,This company was very unified oriented and it gave a since of help to make the company worth being an employee
bad,"A typical day will begin with preparing the menu for fresh food. Taking orders,making people feel comfortable about the atmosphere weather it be the temperature or anything they wanted to talk about. I would get the order in and get it done in a timely manner . In the restaurant business people want their food fast! I had very little help, but the one  The hardest part of the day were the days that no one walked in, I always had hope and faith that there was a bigger purpose for this journey. My favorite part was the people that I had met and developed friendships with,"
bad,"It is very busy. Sometimes you would be lucky if you got a break, They make you work Full time hrs at a part time status. The pay isn't that good. Hard work for little pay and no benefits for part time employees"
bad,"Run...do not work for this company.  I worked there for 15 years.  At the end upper management were getting rid of employees over 45, so I was on the chopping block.  If you're in your late 40's or early 50's look out.  They want to replace you with younger people.  You're probably safe in your late 50's or early 60's because they figure you'll be leaving soon anyway. I hate CVS."
bad,Management stinks. They do not care about employees. If they have problems no one cares
bad,"I worked for cvs for 4 years. During that time the clientele dropped tremendously. They had a new update about every week that really made things worse. Hire employees who were not capable or didn't care to do the job. Let customers talk to you any kind of way. My pharmacy manager would spend all day on the phone with their spouse instead of realizing people were stealing from the pharmacy. Including employees. I asked for a transfer 3 times. I had another store lined up that was closer to where I lived. Each time the pharmacy district manager would say it's the pharamcist incharge's option. They paid me little money..I had been certified 3 and a half years and fought to only make $11/hr. I would come in on days off..stay late..it didn't matter.I put in my 2 weeks notice during my 4th year..my pic told me they would make it so I was not rehirable because the other pharmacy planned to hire me back..furious..I walked out..they begged me to come back. Now they work at a walgreens..if you're looking to advance..unless you're a manager, this isn't for you."
bad,The pay is little.. The company is a billion dollar corporation but can't give employees more money. They are not understanding at all! Pharmacy techs cant paid very little for the work and headaches they deal with on a daily basis. The customers are very demanding and corporate expects you to go above and beyond with each and every customer for a very low pay. Seriously dont work for them
bad,"A typical work day at this place is not a typical day, If you enjoy working with a bunch of immature high school people then this is the place to work. They will tell you about the core values that need to be followed but most of them do not follow them and they are managers of departments (so sad). The General Manager does not have a clue on how to run the place and will go against you in anyway, shape, or form, He is not good at handling problems. He will run away instead of trying to fix the problem. a lot of the people that work there are very two faced. They will be sweet as pie to your face the next minute you turn your back they are talking about you."
bad,"A typical day at CVS has become very un-friendly. Due to the lack of appropriate staff, the day has become a rat race. Because of this lack of help the work flow does not work properly. The Pharmacist and technicians are contantly rushing and going from one position to another covering several places with limited staff, i.e. phones, drop off, pick up, and drive thru. The only good thing that is left is that you work with people you concider family and the few customers who are regular are sympothetic with our situation."
bad,"This place does not care about their employees. They treat you horribly and when it is brought to upper management, they do nothing."
bad,"Log in to the system and start taking calls."
bad,A typical work day would be to answer 120+ calls and resolve the issues.
bad,Very horrible and bad experience. I never want to go there ever again. The employees in the pharmacy are very biased and not very helpful.
bad,"Keep looking..This place is run by satan himself. If you leave, forget about unemployment because they will fight hard to deny it.  Most nurses at the facilities are witches and if you cross them, they tell your supervisor.  Prepare to be written up for any petty reason. If you are not among the favorites..you will be treated like a red-headed step child a driven out. They even track your # of phone calls and whether or not you are logged on to your phone. Trust me..keep looking for something better..the pay sucks too."
bad,"Its a great company,. I lot of my experience I learned it there. Its like a family that cares so much about its patients and customers. I had a great time there but the company wasn't for me."
bad,I have dealt with those that are above and below me in the company and my summation of experiences gained within said company is brief. To be completely honest I would not recommend anyone pursue working for this company for various reasons. In an effort to keep it civil I will leave it at that.
bad,"come in entered new admissions, readmits and discharge long erem patients into business specific program and third party billing to insurance "
bad,"I've worked with the company for four years. Came to work in a blizzard and worked every hour they've asked me to. Even working 4 hours past my scheduled time to help with the workload. I've never called out and rarely been late. Most companies would value me but this one treats me as a piece of chewed gum on the sidewalk. A typical day at work consists of managers and coworkers using profanity and obscene  sexual comments all day. I've learned from working there that from human resources, general manager and my manager that the line between friends is non existent. The hardest part about the job is punching in everyday. The most enjoyable is punching out and getting my paycheck."
bad,Working at CVS/Pharmacy was a decent job. I started of at a good pay rate. My  first manager  was amazing at his job. Everyone worked in a wonderful group and the store looked great. The time schedules were always worked on so everyone could have a little say in what there schedule was like. the benefits were ok. Most of all after we got a new manager our hours were dropped. I got bumped down to part time from full time. I was treated different then people that were there longer. I honestly would never recommend someone to work there. The district manager would say one thing. Then the manager would tell us something different. No one knew what to do half the time.
bad,a typical day is greeting every customer count down the till fill any empty stops you can. assist every customer that needs your assistance. check for expired merchandise damage anything that needs it. write rainchecks if the item is not in the store and print pictures at the kodak kiosk
bad,"while i worked there, there were major issues with the managment. they thought they were right and we basically had no say."
bad,Was a poorly ran pharmacy and management was not involved in a lot of what went on in the pharmacy.
bad,Don't work at this place they treat you like dirt. You will get used up and spit out. This is what I was told by employees when I first started. I really didn't believe them till it happened to me. The GM of this place is a horrible boss.  He has discriminated against more than one employee. Run from this place.
bad,"does not pay good money, work hard and no attention to what you are doing, not equivalent between employment."
bad,This company will offer you a great opportunity and great training and promise things.  They did not hold to any of that. I would not recommend working for CVS
bad,"Company/ Corporate is not fair regarding bonuses or raises"
bad,"very unprofessional place to work, very busy don't get paid enough, Management is very unappreciative of your hard work. they have no compassion. the respect level is unbarable."
bad,Zero support from management.  Zero training.  Expect to be disciplined often for others shortcomings.  Raises are jokes if any are given.   No job security.  No life outside of.work.
bad,"Fast pace job, I learned how to self controlled and engage with people very well, management not good there, my co worker are good team players, dealing with rude customer, making a customer smile makes my day"
bad,Is a very poorly ran company from upper management to lower!
bad,This place is extremely unethical and the management takes complete advantage of people who try to make a living.
bad,Very stressful job and very little support is offered by the supervisors - no one covers anyones back - every day you feel your job is threatened by  the new quality control department which does not score everyone equally - very biased
bad,High turn over that is not a job security the GM wants employees to work themselves into the hospital
bad,Cvs is a growing company that pays pharmacy technicians peanuts whether you have experience or not . That's why many employees quit and there always hiring its great for new techs out of school..
bad,"You will be sorry if your work at the Monroeville office. Came from Aline Temp Agency at $13.00 an hour. I have been working for four months and have been looking for something else. I found out that if I am permanent, I will get the same amount with a few paid holidays and one day per month for vacation. You will be very aware of time because you have to sign in and sign out of the computer, even to use the restroom and they check your timing constantly with writ ups if you take to long of a poo or want to leave your desk. You get 45 min. for lunch and you will be looking at the clock to the minute for when you can sign out of the computer and leave this place. The people are horrible and their personal preference on same sex partners is something I don't agree with and I have to look at this type of behavior because they flaunt it and make it obvious. I was told there is a lot of overtime so I thought I could make some money and I have not seen one day of overtime, I was lied to. Very unhappy and this is a miserable place. Before I took the job, I thought I would get $16.00 an hour once hired full-time because I really never get a straight answer on pay or when I would be hired on from the temp agency. I was hoping to get time and a half for overtime hours. I was told what I wanted to hear to get me in and watch out, once you are working there and need the money for bills, it is hard to get out easy when you need a weekly income. I should have never ever taken this job in the first place and I kick myself daily for my mistake. It is like a jail sentence."
bad,"I used to love my job when I first started. I had fun and I couldn't wait to get to work and that lasted about two years. Over the past three years they have changing the systems and the programs to keep up with technology and instead of it making the job easier it makes it more difficult. The systems are so slow and always crashing and when the work doesn't get done there's no ""don't worry about it we'll get to it tomorrow"" it's being demanded to stay until the work is done. They are constantly cutting hours while the work load gets larger and larger but no OT is approved. They don't look at things from a stores perspective only what the potential is to increase the numbers."
bad,"Poor leadership, no training, horrible pay, unorganized, constant complaining from customers and employees, left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing type of environment."
bad,"Please never work there. You will regret the day that you submitted your application. I am not joking or exaggerating, CVS is a horrible company to work for"
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. There is no chance of promotion and the workload is unreal. The customers treat you like garbage and every paycheck is a slap in the face. I worked for CVS full time for 12 months before I was even allowed a 30 minute lunch break, but I guess that doesn't really matter since I don't make enough money to buy food anyway.......... this job will give you nightmares."
bad,"Place would expect u to work 60 plus hours a week,then let u go due to president getting embarrased of something he was told that wasnt true..dirty vans,needles were tossed not where they were suppose to was fired for somethibg manager did,even tried to refuse me unempliyment ins..filthy sneaky and dirty"
bad,mangement sucks
bad,I would never work for them.
bad,"Strict working condition, not a fun place to work, at least for me."
bad,"I worked with CVS Pharmacy as a technician for 4 years and I can say that it was by far the worst company I have EVER worked for in my entire life. Work days were long and stressful, customers were so rude and hateful, and to top it all off you get paid NOTHING for what you have to deal with. Being there for 4 years I barely got a dollar raise and that was because my manager helped me out as much as he could."
bad,I was part of a temp agency and this job was not a guranteed job they kept me there for 8 months never hired me on. They took advantage of their workers and didn't offer me any benefits. I highly recommend no one get a job there for your well being look somewhere further.
bad,"not recommended at all, they want you to kill yourself for minimum wage, when qualified for much more."
bad,"I work management at cvs and I can't believe how bad the stores have become. Hours are cut mouthy, and it doesn't matter how well your store performs. The last two years I have seen my district fall apart, every store! My store was number 1 in sales, and cut 100 hours a week, that's like one and a half full time jobs cut for being being #1. Now my store looks like a getto 99 cent outlet, and we had half the staff quit because they are only working 10 hours a week. I don't even make enough money buy new shoes every month from them being destroyed unloading trucks in the snow."
bad,"travel long distances from home, do not use much of your nusring skill, tedious work it's the same thing everyday, nothing changes, there is no support from management or supervisors, co-workers do not work as a team"
bad,"I worked as pharmacist for this company for 10 years. I guess that is a little too long to work for this horrible place. Years of 13- hour shifts, no lunch breaks and very few bathroom breaks. Pushed to do more and more with less and less. Hours constantly being cut and implementation of new ways to micromanage popping up every day. Unbelievable! If you have othere choices of gainful employment, please opt out of this one."
bad,"Everyone of my coworkers here learns to hate and I mean HATE it here. You can't get worse management here. They are there to break you down to literally nothing. They treat trash better than their employees! All thee is is drama and discrimination. It's literally like high school. The lunchroom even looks like a high school lunchroom. Exellence is never rewarded, in fact they pick on you more and single you out if you are better at your job than them. They love finding new petty things to scold people about a d it's ridiculous. It's the most crooked place of employment that I have ever been in contact with. The best thing I can compare it to is a cult. Management enjoys talking down and scaring their employees to think they are on the verge of losing their jobs when in fact they can't afford to lose a single employee because all the good workers quit and got sick of the treatment. Then after the threaten their employees about petty stuff, they go back to their office and gossip and giggle about it. I literally caught 2 managers doing that. No lie. I'm just surprised someone hasn't set a bomb to the Omnicare in milwaukee yet. The way they treat their employees should be illegal. Fact: over half of Omnicare employees are on antidepressants just to keep a stable mind while coping with working there. I know I was. If you have a life outside of work, dont expect them to care. One of my coworkers actually got fired because her care broke down and she couldn't get to work on time. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this company! You've been warned, don't say I didn't told"
bad,A typical day at work is you do the job of 3 people. I learnt that it's the worst place to work . Management is there to tear you down and treat you like nothing. The hardest part of the job is doing the job or three people and put up with so many managers and supervisors.
bad,i was not at this place long enough to really get a grasp on how it runs or functions....the people here were wayy to busy to show me anything to do...they just had me clean and dust....other than that the staff was terrific...well all except 1 of the pharmacists.
bad,A typical day at work is stressful. There is not enough staff on hand to complete tasks throughout the day.
bad,the call center environment is a special one that was not a good fit for me or my skill level
bad,Overview of medical billing procedures for a 2-week externship.
bad,"I worked for Coram for the longest two months of my life. Horrible atmosphere, horrible management, horrible training. When I had enough I quit, only to be negatively reviewed by my manager in order to save her job."
bad,"Terrible management and rude, unfriendly staff."
bad,"Favortisim. If you're chummy with the store manager it's ok that you are at your register texting all the time when you aren't ringing...even though it's against policy to have your cell phone with you at the register. I see that ALL DAY from this young female cashier and it really annoys me. Also, she gets away with longer breaks. Of course the store manger let's her do what she wants. Stay away from CVS....they suck."
bad,bad work environment. management has no interest in their employees at all.
bad,Ruuuuuuuuuuñnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!they are a very deceptive company.ur coworkers are the most positive part of the day you are required to work like a machine
bad,"It's a horrible place to be employed at, management is horrible, they say you'll get a promotion and never recieve it, no one would teach any of our new employees anything (management) & I was told to train them with just being a ""cashier"", there wasn't really any enjoyment of the job what so ever."
bad,"high turnover,overwork their employees,cut hours when they like regardless of how many years you been there...I worked for cvs only for 4 months for extra income while my wife finish college...Their emplyees are like slaves...managers abuse them all......"
bad,got our raises and two weeks later laid off. work you hard and they constantly change the work directions
bad,"This place is a meat grinder. If you work here, you are only cannon fodder. You will be used, over used, and abused untill you can not stand them, or they can not stand you. Then you will be spit out like a rotten piece of food. If you do not have RPh attached to your name, don't bother. If you do, the pay is better, but still, don't bother. Do you like 38 hour shifts with no break? Do you like being paged every 20 minutes during your ""sleep"" time? Do you like being blamed for not doing your job because your body is exausted, drained, not having your basic metabolic needs fulfilled, and can not perform your job? To me it is unimaginable that this company can get away with abusing people the way that they do. I have been there, and done that. This is personal experience people! I left there for two reasons. one was the abuse. The second was that I knew that there were errors happening EVERYWHERE, and I did not want my name attached to them. Not sure you believe me? Search through your state's Board of Pharmacy meeting minutes for the complaints filed against Omnicare. To them, it is just the cost of doing business. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS! Do I need to elaborate more? (Yes, this is redundant, need I say more?)"
bad,The worst job that i ever had was working at omnicare as a billing rep. I would not wish that job on my worst enemy.
bad,"This company is only worried about money. They dont care who you are or what you do. They are very unfair, you get paid depending on who you are. They overwork you and do not care if you have a family to get home to, They take away your raises, they let some get workers get away with things and write others up for the exact same thing, depends on who you are."
bad,The pharmacy I work in is horrible. Very disorganized and the pharmacists are lazy and very rude! Throw baskets and tell us to shut up. Everyone brings their issues to work and takes it out on the workers. If I had a choice to take back working there I definitely would!
bad,"The management with this corporation is horrid. Supervisors that take half-hour smoke breaks, give you the cold shoulder when you call them up to assist, and managers that never listen to your requests for time off. At every store I worked at, I had 3 poor managers for every good one."
bad,"I worked for this company for over 3 years, it is the worst company to work for. They are very very UNPROFESSIONAL, rude and do not vaule your time, hard work, nor do they care if you are part of their team or not. The job is very stressful. The pharmacist is unprofessional and does not care about your life/work balance"
bad,Route with so many stops.
bad,This company did not take very good care of it's employees. I would not recommend this company to anyone for any type of job.
bad,"Typical day at work: Come in, say good afternoon (came in at 5:00), stocked, ran the register, kept my area clean, left for the night."
bad,It was the worst decision ever to work at CVS with horrible management. I hope the corporate can hire good management team.
bad,Terrible ethics.. no loyalty to pharmacists or patients. Retail has become terrible but cvs has found ways to make it a nightmare. I would rather work as a pop collector then to work for these geniuses. Bottom of the barrel.. and btw.. now when people start transferring rx to wags as perx comes back.. we have been told by management to give them an hour wait.. call the patient and convince them to stay with cvs.. as if we are used car salesmen .. good luck keeping me here
bad,Lack of communication and bully tactics by direct supervisors makes an otherwise enjoyable enviroment intolerable.
bad,Every function preformed there is time and they bearly train you. they treat everyone like they are in gradeschool and no one is ever allowed to talk unless you are favored by a supervisor. and don't expect to work there long. they love to fire at least 2 to 3 people a week.
bad,Overall this company needs better structsure..The management doesnt know what the other managers are doing.
bad,At the Fairfield location the management sucks and does not want to help you out. They do not want you to move from your seat for any reason and if you do they question your every move! They overload you with work and barely give you time to finish. This job is pro supervisor and they will retaliate if you go against them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO LOOK ELSEWHERE!!
bad,"You're working hard for people who don't appreciate what you do for the company, cvs makes millions while I was nearly paying my bill's"
bad,"Not a lot of experience to get, leadership is lacking, coworkers are childish, nothing enjoyable about working at omnicar."
bad,"Management was very poor. Very unflexible with scheduling, did not willingly accommodate anyones needs."
bad,"Controlled and lied to by the percentage rate of performance. Management is lazy and arrogant. Not given enough breaks to back up the hard work that is required. Just plain mean, miserable, and extremely hot in the summer."
bad,a typical day at work would be busy and fast pace which i liked and on the weekends i was by myself just me and the pharmacist so alot of multi-tasing going on. i learned everything i know at cvs my co workers were great to work with. the hardest part of the job would be producing prescriptions in 15 minutes or less when there were 15 people waiting.lol. the most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to work with my co workers and helping the customers
bad,"would not recommend a career with this company. they dont care about thier temp employees, they dont ever hire you they say they will but only string you along until theycan replace you with another temp employee!"
bad,Work too hard for little pay and unrealistic benefits... annual raise only .10 per year
bad,"worst place to work in, like a cow shop not caring about customers, treated like a pack of horses or cows, many prescription mistakes, don't bring your prescriptions there, lines long,"
bad,"Don't work for this company,when i got sick they treated me poorly"
bad,"Not really friendly. But i liked that it was very fast paced. A great company to work for if you are a young person, looking to get paid Not so well."
bad,Not a great company for technician. They do not value there employees the way they should.
bad,"After 3 + years with this company I have realized that this is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. As a superviser I was responsible for 30 employees and most of the employees were all older women who had been working for the company for 20 plus years. I worked every shift, graveyard, morning and close. They promised me a promotion after a year but that never came because Every manager I worked for got fired or left."
bad,Management is only concern about numbers.
bad,Miserable people working a miserable job. The staff is underpaid and they hate their job.
bad,Manager brought drama and excessive stress among co-workers which caused an imbalance in the system and chain of command in essence causing an inflammation of hostility between workers from cashiers to supervisors and up.
bad,Will work you to death and then let you go no matter how many years you have been there.
bad,company will work you to death and then let you go no matter how many years of service you have in. They give you a false sense of security in your job
bad,"This company does not care about its employees. I had to fight with them every 2 weeks because they always delayed my paycheck due to it took time to ""process"". The building is nasty, dirty , smells of mildew. Management treats all of the employees like fourth graders. The fire sprinklers went off and completelysoaked some of the workstations with brown dirty water. Maintenance was called, dried it off with a towel, let the carpetr air dry, (did not clean anything) and told us to go back to our workstation that smelled of mold and mildew. If you try to contact a manager with a question you will not ever get a response...EVER..they completely ignore you hoping that you will go away"
bad,Unprofessional and dishonest are the two primary descriptors I would have to use for this organization.
bad,Advice to Senior Management:
bad,Low base pay and with little or no raise. Disorganized company. Only gives one 1/2 hr break if you work 6 hrs or more!
bad,"No room for advancement and terrible pay. If you're not a PharmD, don't work here."
bad,"CVS paid a poor wage for the amount of work we had to do. We were always understaffed and had a lot to do every shift. Only two people per shift-- a cashier and a supervisor-- maybe 3 when the store manager was in from 7-3. It was almost impossible to get everything done that they asked! The store looked poor because of other employees and management not pulling their weight. Upper management was very much a ""good ol boys club"" and no one ever got fired, just transferred. Management was sexist and I heard some generally nasty things from male coworkers. Overall? A terrible place to work and bad company culture. I guess it taught me some red flags to look for, and how to spot creeps in the workplace. Maybe not every store was like this, but this was my experience."
bad,Job started off at 30 hours weekly after a year was cutback to 12 weekly. Never had a review or raise. Company doesn’t care about driver safety. Let a fellow driver continue to work after two accidents.
bad,You will work excessive amount of hours claiming mandatory overtime.  You would get fired if the overtime was not put in. Does not take Dr notes to be out of work due to health issues if missed work due to being sick they not only took your days off your vacation would also penalize you by giving you a point you are allowed 5 points then dismissed so if you get the flu either say good bye to your job also does not approve FMLA if you are diabetic causing severe kidney issues
bad,No work Life balance. Expected us to work 16 hour days seven days a week instead of increasing the headcount or bringing in temps. Only care about the management making their bonuses.
bad,Pay is low for the amount of work that's expected of a tech. Rarely have a shift where we have a full staff due to always shortage of hours. The only thing that's taught is the metrix the company expects you to meet. Everyone is just a number.
bad,"Hired full time. 6 months before benefits. Scheduled for 30 hrs or less per week. Part time staffer (with no benefit package) scheduled for 39.5 hrs per week. One day 3 hrs, another 10 hrs. Understaffed and training is arbitrary and rushed."
bad,"They are perpetually short staffed, scheduling sucks, and management doesn’t care about their employees. They break their own rules/NYS laws just to avoid having customers complain to corporate. Just don’t."
bad,"do not wish to provide a review at this time for CVS."
bad,"Very stressful work environment with minimal tech help. Always have to arrive early and stay late unpaid, in order to complete tasks. Taking full advantage of Pharmacists and the job market right now, with decreasing wages for more work. Disappointing place to work but if you need something they’re always hiring due to turnover."
bad,"Even if you have your Pharmacy Technician licence, you will get ""pharmacy clerk"" title for months and months, that way they will save $$. The pharmacy is a mess, is clean only when we will have visitors (the big bosses). Always lots of work, but short employees!"
bad,"The company pays a little more than other companies for the skills required but the management is cruel. The amount of work given is undoable. You are considered a robot. The management is always looking for ways to manipulate you, giving you bad work shifts, giving you more work than possible and having no sympathy."
bad,"Profits over patients. The bigger the company, the worse they treat employees. Other younger colleagues unsupportive. Moral is poor. Overall working conditions unsatisfactory."
bad,"No flexibility, no support, no accountability, no appreciation, no NOTHING!!!!. This company, retail  period, at least this form of retail is work I would not recommend that anyone get themselves involved in. Not a good substitute to make money or a living. Would not go back even with s six figure salary."
bad,The employees barely get enough income to survive. Management will keep telling you about customer service. . Looking for job don’t work at cvs . The pay hourly is lower than most other retail stores
bad,CVS Caremark is an overly demanding company that doesn’t want to pay for overtime worked. The managers micromanage all their employees including the shift leads. Then the shift leads overly micromanage employees under their watch due to being micromanaged themselves. Calls are constantly monitored and employees are routinely pulled off of active calls to be reprimanded.
bad,"They work you like a slave , and don’t want to pay you , they will have you working long shifts along with two other techs in a busy pharmacy, it’s not worth applying in my opinion"
bad,"It was an okay job, we did stuff a lot, there was always work to be done. It is a place to work at when you dont know what to do or just part time but that is it."
bad,The North Augusta distribution Center was very hard work but good benefits. Bad supervisors and complainers who wine a lot. I had a shift lead position. I was overworked and underpaid. Do NOT work at any distribution center. Load and noisy environment with lame and upset people and moody truck drivers.
bad,"Unqualified supervisors who have no ability to train their employees. Managers have no experience in managing. I was an ACO, the position no longer exists because it was a ridiculous position to have in the first place. Thank goodness for whoever realized that. For those of you that have been there and truly understand the meaning of your job. Thank you for taking care of your patients."
bad,"Days are not productive because payroll is cut so drastically that nothing outside of ringing register is accomplished. No support, no balance to the daily demands. Customers come first weather right or wrong, and management does not support creativity or independent thinkers. Cvs is a healthcare company and yet their stores are often dirty, backrooms are not hygenic at all, some to the point of pest infestation. Its quite disgusting and to think that consumers shop for groceries here. Completely unacceptable."
bad,"AT FIRST. I caught on quickly and began to absolutely love my job, however, the management is terrible! Supervisor and team lead are all day laughing together and never want to help when needed. No room for"
bad,"Do not work there. They do not care for their employees. Unrealistic expectations, upper management is a complete joke. Not enough payroll given to run a store."
bad,"No words. Management talked about you all day, co workers did nothing but snitch on you, they worked you like a SLAVE. If you had an emergency, they would give you the time off but would talk behind your back. NO room for growth, and you get taken advantage of. DO NOT APPLY FOR A JOB AT CVS. the customers say it all the time— we were never paid enough for what we had to do."
bad,"If you are a minority, you WILL have issues with advancement. CVS Health needs to be audited from an outside agency. There has been so many internal complaints about discrimination but upper management, HR does nothing about it. Their supervisors and managers are inexperienced and only got in those positions because of favoritism."
bad,"Understaffed, overworked, rushed and stressed; told i couldn't restroom because we were busy. Management treats you like you are never good enough. They value speed and volume over safety. They treat employers like machines and understaff while they increase workload. Boss talks negatively about  employees on the phone while staff can hear. DO NOT recommend!"
bad,This company is money hungry. They won’t give you hours unless you full open availability . So to get benefit you can’t have set schedule. My district manager is low key racist.
bad,"Working for CVS Pharmacy requires you to abandon your free time if you want to have a sustainable amount of hours. As soon as you want to put in hours or days you cannot work due to ( family, schooling, etc.) they cut your hours drastically. The work load task and the amount of hours you are given to complete the task each day are ludicrous. What is not factored in is that CVS has customers some locations more than others but they still expect to have every task on the check list completed each day (2019: now including UPS Drop Off site handled by CVS employees). Daily they instill the fear of your job is on the line if you cannot complete the task. CVS is constantly hiring new employees due to the high turn out rate. All in all, CVS is good for a temporary job not a Permanent career."
bad,"Hours cut often, don't like to pay for hard work. Management is very poor whether it is store management, district leaders, or upper management. Good entry level learning experience though or maybe something to take on while in school or working another job."
bad,CVS does not care about the safety of their employees. They have a huge organized retail crime ring that steals products and robs the pharmacy. They have tons of money but dont care about silent alarms at their locations. They just expect you to be robbed and call the police later. Culture is twisted and backwards.
bad,"Full time but because of hour cuts by corporate I'm rarely scheduled more than 16 hrs per week, so I have to pick up shifts at other stores in order to survive. "
bad,"Pay is low. Management is bad. Co-workers, some are great, some not so much. One thing, they did work with my nursing school schedule.  Policies are outdated."
bad,"CVS has no regard for their employees or building a culture. You will be working 60 hours a week to maintain a store and meet ridiculous expectations by yourself. You will be on call day and night, even on vacation. Favoritism is very high. No positive reinforcement, no raises, and increased workload. No respect for long time employees who dedicated themselves to this company. Highly toxic workplace. No thanks."
bad,Daily work is to be completed by the end of day. We are to complete at least 154 items daily. The hardest part of the position is learning insurance. You must have at least 99% quality monthly.
bad,You are expected to do every job but they will not increase your salary. Long hours because all the work they cram In a day cannot be achieved. Instead of hiring experienced they rather hire someone with no experience to keep salary at the lowest. Supreme favoritism.
bad,"Constantly cutting hours company wide, eliminated half their district managers, no real training or focus on employee development. Managers are over worked and abused because they are salaried."
bad,"Terrible management.  Overworked, short staffed, no lunch breaks, high turnover, you have to do your job plus the work of two or three other people plus stay after work without pay to meet the unrealistic goals of the company. "
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy at CVS across from the hospital, it was also stressful and we were understaffed which meant we got behind which meant customers were not happy, which made us not happy."
bad,This was by far the worst place for me to work after the first manager left the store. When the other manager came in things just went down hill and the associate manager became even worse.
bad,Its a great place to work when they decide to give you hours. I have been two months without any hours and they just keep telling me that there are none that corporate isnt giving the area any. if it wasnt for that Id love it here.
bad,Lack of support for the front store from upper management.  Skeleton crew is expected to run the front and also is required to help the RX if they get backed up.
bad,"Due to restructuring in 2017, upper management was no longer required to be a pharmacist making it difficult to get ""coached"" on issues.  As a pharmacy manager, it was very frustrating to reach out for help to a person who had no medical or pharmacy experience.   Yes, pharmacy is a business, but when a person has no empathy or understanding of the daily issues faced by his/her team, it creates a gap in knowledge that can't be bridged by business experience alone."
bad,"Horrible working here. Of all the retail chain, by far the worst! Short staffing, long hours, no breaks for pharmacists. Too many metrics to meet and you put in extra hours to meet unrealistic goals."
bad,When you first start working at CVS corporate they are very nice but after you’ve been there at least three years management will try to get you out so they can replace you with lower paying employees. Training was a joke during my time there. Managers are trained to be cold and unresponsive to the employees needs. Every month there were cut back’s On department events and employee appreciation luncheon’s.
bad,"This location was always understaffed. They required someone at self check out which was always broken and expected said person to get the register if at all possible. Granted I got paid $11 starting when min wage was 7.50, but there was no advancement and the coworkers were extremely lazy and refused to do things correctly. When I'd ask for a manager to come down and assist, without fail, they would always say no. Also; it's ranked 8000 something in the list of around 9000 CVS stores in quality and customer satisfaction."
bad,"My manager expected me to work even though I had class. He states that its company policy that I have to let him know two weeks ahead he never posts 2 weeks out schedules. And I let him know a week in advance so. On the schedule, it says I work two-three days, but I have to come over to give extra hours on my time to help with pcq, etc.  They give you so many responsibilities, and the customers give you shi t. You hardly get breaks, because its too hectic and no one works there with you, cuz CVS is cutting hours. Its pure slavery that goes around the law, don't apply."
bad,"The awful working environment is not worth the pay. CVS pretends to care about patients, but really only cares about profits. It would be nice if they cared about both. There is a culture among management lacking integrity spread throughout the company. I have worked in 5 different states for CVS and it's been the same everywhere. And it goes higher up the chain than just district and regional managers. Why work for a company that does not actually care about caring?"
bad,Upper mgmt is such a joke.  They are a click and protect the favorites.  You can work and do all the right things but you will get no where unless you fit in with the click.  No job is safe especially since there are many duplicate roles with aetna merger.
bad,"The management says they want to serve a multitude of seriously ill specialty rx patients quickly and with quality, but lack the right amount of adequately qualified staff to accomplish this effectively.  Even if you are qualified, you will be punished for spending time correcting problems to get rx orders out.  Management is rewarded for call- volume (numbers)."
bad,"There is no such a thing as ""Customer Care!"
bad,I want to leave to learn more about the medical field. At CVS I felt trapped and was not able to explore how I hoped to. I want to be able to speak with patients and enjoy my time at work. But at CVS I was not able to and I honestly could not wait to leave!
bad,Everything from the district management on down was a mess.  My hours were cut because an evening I needed off conflicted with the manager's volleyball schedule...  They claim to be customer centric but none of their initiatives reflect that.  They want customer feedback but don't do anything with it...  Most of all they do not care for their employees whatsoever and I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone.
bad,"I don't know if it was just my district, but it was horrible. I encountered so many issues with racism, gender discrimination, lies being told constantly, ethics line doesn't help, and everyone I encounter is extremely unhappy and worked to the bone. This job is depressing, and stressful. I had to be put on multiple anxiety and depression meds because of my district manager and just the overall culture of CVS. I loved my job and worked hard everyday of my life just to be screwed over time and time again. I cannot stress enough...CVS does not care about you mental, physical, health or wellbeing. They want money and you have to give everything in life to them."
bad,"Favoritism, hire who they want for any job, don't really treat employees right,  rude and once hired you really dont have a say in nothing mgrs do what they want. If they don't like you they will fire you somehow, someway."
bad,"Not the place you want to go when you have options. Job is based on a speed rating, you go faster you earn more money, seems easy but very tiring and if you are too slow you will be fired. Very unsanitary. Overtime is mandatory and you will not know how many hours you will work until a couple of hours into actually working every single day. The people are not the worst some are great but  everyone complains every single day even if they have been there for years. This is the type of job you go to when you have no experience and nowhere else to go.There are other departments you can go to but can not apply for 6 months after being hires and they"
bad,"Worst place ever worked, Very poor orientation, high expectations with OUT orientation. POOR management team, nursing manager has No integrity, will say anything to protect self whether truth or not. other staff Rns Ok management horrid"
bad,I only stayed for as long as I did because of the people I worked with. We were a pharm fam but understaffed and under paid. Hours constantly get cut. It's all corporate. Don't work here.
bad,Not a good company to work for at all. Terrible work life balance.  Promote people that shouldn't even work there. I'm sure some locations are better than others.
bad,They take advantage of management. Management expected to do it all while workers sit around and do nothing. If you discipline the workers upper management will override you. I was a victim of an armed robbery at work and it took loss prevention over 3 days just to call and ask if I was alright. No one cared about the incident.
bad,"Never enough help. Very unorganized. Terrible filling system of the filled RXbags. Computer program in pharmacy is not good and too many over repetitive key strokes for just 1 patient. Shouldn't have to do all the steps just to fill prescriptions and same with the picking up of the prescriptions.  There are better programs out there. And like always upper management and corporate "
bad,"You will have to do everything by yourself since the pharmacist won’t help out."
bad,"Overseas personnel are doing the jobs now,CEO and management only care about money. They do not care about anything but money for shareholders and senior managers."
bad,"Constant stress due to short staffing - no relief in sight. Company does not care. Workload keeps increasing without additional staffing to cover. In fact, the number of hours for hourly staff keeps getting cut making it increasingly difficult to budget.  It used to be an enjoyable place to work. No longer true."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. They have completely unreasonable expectations, and do not give you the resources necessary to do the job. Staffing has been drastically cut over and over. Working conditions are unsafe. Company does not care about staff or customers, they are completely profit driven."
bad,"Save your selfs and don’t work for this company. Everyone is fake and liars. Pharmacist manager was a complete drag, always slow and kept you behind yet you were the one always to blame. In fact any mistake was your fault. Always forced to do so much when you already had a lot on your plate. Makes the job 10x more stressful. Loved what I did but hated who I had to work with."
bad,"I meant omnicare which is cvs subdivision. Senior pharmacist so lazy and condescending, gossiping all the time. She always take longer break and take off anytime she wants. She would work extra if is holiday. Always getting some overtime pay. She acts friendly when cooperation team comes."
bad,Get ready to do the mangers job as well as yours!!! I was blamed for a lot of stuff i has no control over...and mangers expect you to do there job! They also talked behind people’s back to me like...so I’m pretty sure they did the same to me
bad,"The workload is crushing and staffing is non-existent. Management is not engaged in the day to day working of the office and offers no help unless specifically told that they must help. No team work in the office, its every department for themselves. I worked an average of 10-12 hrs daily when hired for an 8 hour shift. Not a good place if you want to keep your professional license."
bad,My store manager was unprofessional and was not shy about showing favoritism. This review is essentially pointless as I don't think anyone applying for a job at CVS actually believes the company will really care about him/her. This job is purely mercenary.
bad,"Probably the worst job I've ever had."
bad,"Over worked, management is awful and the company does not care about you, your just meat to them.  Constant unrealistic corporate daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly goals that are next to unobtainable.  They demand you meet these goals but when your day to day pharmacy upkeep tasks like inventory, regulatory and other tasks start falling behind you get yelled at for that as well.  However, you cannot work over 40 hours no matter what so your left with the choice.  Do this DEA regulatory paperwork, help these patients, work off the clock and get fired or just deal with getting constant complaints from corporate and patients about how you can't keep up.  "
bad,"A historically abusive customer abused me in public so badly that area customers nearby complained to management about his abusive behavior. CVS response?  ""Give that customer a $50 gift card to cheer him up!"""
bad,"You are to complete all task with minimal hours to even run the store. As a store manager you are scheduled 45 hours a week, it 55 to 60 hours worked to complete all task. District managers only care about the pharmacy, that is all CVS. They treat front store staff like dirt. Don't work here.."
bad,"At first I was very excited to work at CVS, but after the first 2 months, I started to realize that they are very unorganized, all the employees hate working there, the hours they give you are not enough to survive, there is so much mental abuse from the customers because nothing is ever ready (due to poor management) etc. Would not recommend."
bad,CVS do not care about their staff and management takes everything personal. If your looking for stability and a nonstressful place to work this is not it.
bad,"Retail has poor management. Overworked and underpaid employees. The employed are miserable, uninterested and not trained well. Unreliable job. In the end you do more than what they offer. It’s retail not a career! What a messy toll!"
bad,"I was very excited to work for CVS, I had plans to make this my career job. Noticed quickly although they are CVS HEALTHCARE, when they’re employees are sick, or have family emergencies, they are NOT supportive. You cannot even be one minute late, but if your one minute early there are no arguments. "
bad,This company no longer cares about it’s employees. The workload is extremely heavy with only 2 ppl to a shift to handle it. The company also allows. Wet little time to train their new hires. They are just thrown into the store and expected to keep up with the pace of the store.
bad,"A work day in the life at the Richardson office is more like a joke. If you are friends and YES person to the current manager you are in. Other wise, they talk about you to others (openly in meetings) and among themselves. No management at all. Confidentiality is a joke. I wouldn't tell them if I broke a nail...The slightest issue is pushed to HR. The management team has secret outings with certain employees. Upper management is even worse talking to them is like stalking o a brick wall issues are not addressed but just smiled upon. Don't know what the whole thing is here but it's a paycheck..."
bad,I was hired in at part time and was told I would work maybe 2-3 days a week. I informed the manager that I couldn’t work weekends due to having children and that my husband worked weekends. Started my first week looked at the schedule for the next 3 weeks and it was almost full time hours. So I just went with it. We have to take assessment tests on the tablet there well there was no time for that so the manager said just scan through it and I will give you the answers at the end. Ridiculous! After about my 3rd week there I ended up getting extremely sick with bronchitis. Now I never get sick but I did. Went to the urgent care was told take 3 days off I only took one because the 2 days after that we’re my days off anyways. I thought okay I will get better. I also had a Drs note. I ended up getting worse so I went to the Emergency Room was told I had acute bronchitis and that I wasn’t getting enough air into my lungs so I need to do breathing treatments every 4 hrs (also had Drs note). Well the manager was so mad told me that I needed to find someone to cover me because he wasn’t going to work on his day off for anyone. Needless to say I had to go in the next day and work until someone came in to cover my shift. I ended up coughing up blood and was extremely weak and couldn’t hold myself up the next day. I was so sick and he was so non compassionate that I just quit. I was told by the manager they don’t accept Drs notes too. He was So rude and I will never ever work for this company again. He also leaves before his work is done and makes everyone else cover him.The store isn’t
bad,i would never work for the or tell anybody to work for cvs the job an management was very poor i will never go back to them ever again cvs does not care about there employees
bad,"This is not a good company to work for (nothing new there). They treat you like a criminal and overwork you for little pay. Only two people in store at any given time and that's not acceptable for proper customer service. LP is there to watch the employees and customers steal left and right. Stores are outdated and are filthy. There are roaches all over the floor and bugs on food since they're to cheap to fix anything. Computers run so slow that they freeze and you have to restart the transaction with couponers! Do not expect any benefits since they don't hire full time and nobody will get 40 hours, ever. They will eventually phase out retail and become full healthcare destination. I do not see any positives for this company if they continue to treat people the way they do. Shame on CVS."
bad,"Training was incredibly insufficient and poorly organized. It's pretty much just 3 weeks of powerpoint presentations and we were only able to listen a few calls during that time with only 2 of them being an actual call, not actors. I was given an opportunity to actually sit with a CCR and listen to live calls on only 2 separate occasions. You're also put on the phone answering live calls only 1 week into training which is way too soon. There were very few opportunities to actually practice what we were learning with our classmates (role play). And no authentic member accounts that we could reference for training. After 3 weeks of classroom training, you're out on the floor taking calls on your own with trainers/supervisors available if you need assistance. Expecting new reps to be ready for the floor after reading a bunch of powerpoints is just not realistic. There's an abundance of reference materials but the search engine could be very frustrating and often wouldn't pull up the reference guide I was looking for unless I got the search terms just right. The training classes are large, 25-30 people. And people drop like flies. The turnover rate is incredible. The schedules aren't great and it's almost impossible to get two days off in a row. Another thing that is very frustrating is the fact that you only get a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks. You can not leave the property during your 15 breaks because they are paying you for your breaks. There is also no smoking permitted with 50 ft of their property. So, you can't smoke on your break, only during your 30 lunch period."
bad,Management there do not care about employees. They pretend to by having parties and special little giveaways of things. If they were to save that stuff and return it into compensation instead so people were paid more then it would be a lot better I believe.
bad,"Had to stay hours past my shift cause orders come in constantly. Difficult to take lunch breaks cause the company’s sale liaisons constantly ping your email for you to push orders out and everyone orders are more important then the others. Leadership be as lost as entry level employees, HR does not direct you to fill out i9. They send u pdf files to read and somewhere in there it tells u how to find where they stored their I9s in their system."
bad,"Honeslty I could say a lot, but if you really need the money work here. Dont expect a raise THEY WILL HOLD IT. Breaks are super short. One minute late and you get a point. Scattered mangement. Long working hours on a moments notice. Doing random coworkers work only to get behind in yours. DISCOUNT FOR RETAIL STORES IS GREAT THO!"
bad,Fast paced environment with competing priorities and limited chance of success. The IT portion of the company is centered around cost reduction and not long term planning or growth
bad,"They harass people to try to get them to fill more rxs. We literally have a quota of how many people who didn't fill their medication yet, we can convince to fill this medication."
bad,"I have never hated dreading going to a place more than having to go to work at CVS pharmacy. Management was not the best so i only got anywhere from 5-12 hours a week, and apart from that on the days that i was not put on the schedule employees would call off and if i didn't come in to cover for them it was seen as bad even though i am not to blame for someone else choosing to not come to work.Our pharmacy was also very understaffed so when we got rush hours we would fall behind and there would be days when costumers would even curse at us techs for not having enough help. it was an extremely competitive job position and with a hostile work environment so i had to leave as soon as i could."
bad,CVS is the worse place to work for. They are highly demanding and they don't compensate for all the hard work you do to help. The District manager is horrible at her job and all she cares for is scores. Way too demanding for the little bit of money that they offer.
bad,they do not give you enough training. the long 12 to 14 hours shifts are draining.  upper management only cares about numbers.  you will run short of help....upper management not supportive.  advice and counsel does not listen to you at all
bad,They are always cutting hours and not giving any explaination. They say they care about patients but they're putting everyone in danger with their decisions. Management is a joke. They pick favirites and leave everyone else out to dry. I need this job to pay the bills but corporate is ruining the pharmacy. I feel bad for my patients. And corporate doesn't care and neither do the managers because they're not affected by the hour cuts.
bad,"Won't be able to balance work and life. "
bad,"Always understaffed, high turnover, and unrealistic goals. Not being able to meet your goals time and time again makes you feel inadequate. There's only so much you can take."
bad,If you want to be good here you’ll need to be a favorite or have family work there to back you up. If management don’t like you your  screwed big time
bad,"Poor staffing, mandatory overtime, no work/life balance. They expect to pay you as minimum as possible to get the most work out of you. You can work hard and not advance for years while others can smooth talk their way in and not have any knowledge. Corrupt!"
bad,Definitely who you work with but overall the environment is extremely stressful and always terribly understaffed and still had hours cut to our store.
bad,"You are always on call and you are expected to answer the call whenever it comes.  I have worked on Christmas and NYE for the last 11 years, but supposedly we have these days off.  I know the senior management ALWAYS are off."
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had as a pharmacist. Long hours standing with no break. 60 hours of PTO per year which is insulting. Lower than average pay. Only heard from management if it was something bad. 8 years of experience and relegated to being a floater and driving up to 2 hours while new grads got the desirable positions. No real room for advancement but if you do advance it's at personal sacrifice. Customers are nasty, rude and disrespectful in a routine basis. I started hating humanity because if this job. ZERO JOB SECURITY"
bad,"Due to short staffing and ridiculous daily duties the environment becomes one of people attacking each other even tho they are all in it together! Sad, horrid place to work. DO NOT DO IT! Direct manager would pick up her phone when I voiced my challenges. She did not care one iota what her employees think. We are in a non union state and they know it and work us to the point of teeth grinding and bad dreams."
bad,no comments guess the stars speak for themselves there is plenty of biased outlook within the management and truly inefficient when it comes to helping team to help customers
bad,"Sub title: 20th Century Culture in the 21st Century"
bad,"Management lacks caring, nothing can be reviewed that helps employee concerns, training is sub-par, little individual care by superiors, most people there for paycheck."
bad,Great way to get experience in the pharmacy industry but not for long term career advancement. Get the exposure then transfer to another scope of practice.
bad,"Supervisor comes in and whispers to the Technicians behind the back of the Pharmacy Manager. Always focusing on the negative, no positive feedback. Hostile unprofessional work environment."
bad,"Highly stressful environment because the manager's and supervisors are incompetent. The site manager has zero trust in his shift supervisors, so everyday the supervisors, front office, and managers are in meetings for hours. The supervisors expect other people to do their job and their manager's jobs for them. You get chewed out for using company computers for training on breaks. Eventually when you make too much hourly, they find some excuse to fire you. The company does not care for its employees. The stress from doing other people's jobs is just not worth the pay. People are promoted way past their level of competency."
bad,"No work life balance, managers expect you to work on the weekend to complete your work, unless you are in their click, then you get treated better than everyone else."
bad,"Omincare (CVS) does not care about employees at all. a persons father died during billing and manager actually got mad at employee for going to funeral , told her to get over it.HR is a joke, once you contact them you have a X on you. does not matter how great a worker you are, or that you never lay out if you do not kiss management tail your out. very very high turn over.  I wouldn't go back to this job if I was homeless and starving."
bad,cvs does not often foster a supportive work environment for its employees. the almightily dollar always wins. not much room for counseling with the timer ticking all day long.
bad,"I have worked many stressful jobs in my life.  Part of the reason I took this position was the promise of a 6-week training program.  The truth is... you are on the phones with customers after 2 weeks.  Yes, there are people walking around to help you for the remaining 4 weeks and they are wonderful, but the stress of not being able to figure out what to do is unbearable.  It isn't that I can't handle stress.  I have been a police officer, a TSA screener, in the Army and so on (I moved a lot as an Army wife.)  The program is not user-friendly, so most of the Customer Care Representatives get it wrong.  They just learn little tricks to get the ratings they need to survive and keep the customers from calling back within the time they'd get dinged.  By then, the customer is angry because they are out of and in desperate need of their medications.  The companies they work for change their prescription plan.  They don't read their new plan and are furious when they call CVS Caremark about high deductibles, etc.  It's emotionally draining to hear these poor people go through this.  Forget drinking enough water to survive, you won't get enough bathroom breaks to go without a doctor's notice.  Direct supervisors seem to try, but it's awful there. There is a high turnover.  I heard crying and IBS sounds in the bathroom daily.  Once one call is over, it rings into you as soon as the customer hangs up.  There is no time to type in what you need to type or to take a deep breath to recover emotionally from the last call."
bad,"All in all, this was a terrible company to work for."
bad,"These people try to portray a public persona that they care about people when in reality they do not. Everyone is disposable and if you do get to advance they are quick to remind you that you are disposable. Horrible company, horrible people and upper management is the worst."
bad,"CVS is all talk and no show. The benefits are substandard. The management is not at all concerned with the happiness of the employees. There is a lot of discrimination going on, and even trying to get HR involved does not help.  The metrics are horrible and stressful and no one is happy. We do our best for the patients but the metrics don't show that. Hours are cut based on stock price, not actual business. The hiring process is horrible and the promotions are almost non-existent, especially with the deletion of certain positions."
bad,"CVS was a very different place to work for five years ago. Now, they allow only two workers per shift -- supervisor and cashier, yet still expect the same workload of five to be completed. I've seen four managers come and go. This is the worst place to work for, managers don't know how to hire/fire and freak out if you ever have to call in sick. There is zero potential increase in wage and they start you at or $1 above minimum wage. When minimum wage increases you will not be compensated. Don't work here long term if you must."
bad,My store was run by a 26 year old who only got the position because his brothers are Store managers there. Immature and racist who asks more from you than time allowed. Nit picker and super micro manager.
bad,Always hectic and under staffed and under paid make it nearly impossible to collect benefits.  Must work 11 months before you can even be considered for full time and then must maintain an average of over 30 hours a week which is next to impossible with the hours they allow the managers for staffing.
bad,"Hostile.Work.Environment. I hated it. A few supervisors were decent, but the fellow employee associates mostly sucked and were/are not on my level. The best thing I can say is that it was a steady bi-weekly paycheck."
bad,It does not matter how hard you fight or try you will not have the resources to provide a happy environment management is hostile to say the least and if numbers are donw it's never there fault it's yours and your constantly on eggshells
bad,"I have never seen so many unorganized people that were in charge of something a day in my life. The employees that already work there are rude and no one is welcoming. I honestly don't see how they're still in business. Management only cares that there are bodies present and not about the petty, childish, things that go on. The only reason I gave 1 star is because I had to."
bad,"typical day work disorganized and no communication. learned nothing I did not know . management does not care about employees. workplace culture terrible, employees talk behind each others back. hardest part of job was training communication, there was none. best part job health benefits"
bad,"The company prioritizes computerized scheduling, increases workload with unnessasary calls to customers while cutting full time employees to part time hours; it creates an unbearable work enviroment. I work hard for every company but I will not slack on my attention to detail in order to meet call quotas or push prescriptions thru without proper inspection due to time constraints."
bad,"My daily job in the pharmacy always offered a challenging, fulfilling day. There aren’t really any opportunities to advance here. Unless you have a pharmacy degree you are stuck in the position."
bad,Every thing revolves around the word favoritism if they like you you can get away with a lot of things.  I wouldn't recommend this job to even my enemy.
bad,"CVS continually cuts the weekly hours available to technicians, while the workload and company demands increase. The pay is low considering the amount of work expected. There is little time to actually spend with each patient, which is what this business should be all about. Unfortunately, it is all about the bottom line.  It is the classic story of a large, greedy company that does not compensate it's employees appropriately.  CVS continues to acquire other businesses, and the CEO is one of the highest paid in the country."
bad,There's a lot of stir that techs might be losing their jobs..due to budget cuts. I think they played favoritism too much. We never knew when we would be able to leave for the day. I would be there for hours extra and not get compensated or even thanked for staying late. It was always passing it off to the next person in command.
bad,"Really biased environment to work"
bad,"There was little to no training on anything.  Just forced you to get thru the 'required' agenda."
bad,"At the time I was there, I worked in a poor location so the customers made the environment unsafe and stressful on a daily basis.  The worst part of the job was manager verbally harassed me when I was trying to assist a deaf customer at closing time because he was ready to leave."
bad,"I would never work for CVS again in my life! I've worked at alot of jobs, and I've been management for the last 15 years, and I've NEVER seen such disregard for the human race as I found working for this establishment."
bad,"I honestly have no idea how I continued to work at CVS for almost a year, given the working conditions. My first day working at CVS Pharmacy was absolute chaos and training was terrible; if you even want to call it training. It was a fairly busy day, apparently too much for them to handle, so they literally threw me on the cash register and told me to, ""just figure it out."" Every time I would ask anybody a question, I was made to feel like I was wasting their time and I should know what I was doing after an hour of working there. The line of customers behind the register grew longer and longer and they only grew angrier. Seeing as I was selling people their medications and it could be highly dangerous if given the wrong prescription, training should be so much better than what was given! Everyone who worked there was SO rude and it was agonizing to get through an entire shift with my coworkers. I'd had enough when one of them had become very creepy towards me and absolutely NOTHING was done about it. Poor management, rude or creepy coworkers, close to no hours, and horrible training were what made me call it quits, I'd have to say..."
bad,"Working for Caremark after 8 years just gets worse. You get 30 cent raises to take on the most difficult calls. One screaming customer after another. The culture is horrible and management tries to embarrass you at meetings. People are not allowed to go to the bathroom at only 3 scheduled times even if they know you have a medical condition. Turn over rate is huge. I started getting panic attacks and dreaming of customer screaming at me. I had to quit for my health. You are a cog to management. No one tells you if you do good only when you do bad, which is every evaluation."
bad,It used to be a beautiful store and full of happy employees.. now it's empty and barely anyone works there now. The new manager doesn't care about anything. He's always mad and snapping
bad,"CVS does not pay at a rate to keep quality employees, which this job requires. Even if they did, pharmacies are not budgeted enough hours to stay fully staffed throughout the days."
bad,My supervisor was extremely rude and loud. She yelled at me for asking a question and did not allow me to explain anything. She yelled at me on the floor where everybody could hear and listen to what was said.
bad,"CVS only cares about numbers & statistics. Because of this, we are constantly understaffed. You are given goals & deadlines with no tools to meet them with. Extremely stressful environment with very little incentive to work, would never recommend."
bad,"ALWAYS short staffed, very strict on hours allowed to be scheduled for the whole store. They never care that there isn't enough staff to handle the demands of the customers. They don't give a lick about their employees AT ALL."
bad,"Zero trust is instilled in the pharmacy technicians, likely for good reason but as a pharmacy student it left a lot to be desired. Pay was low compared to equivalent jobs at neighboring pharmacies and hospitals. While working here, my prescriptions were always filled on time and I never had a problem. After working here, the staff was suddenly encountering all sorts of issues with my prescription and on occasion made me wait 3+ days for things that could have been filled and I knew from experience were always in stock. I have completely switched pharmacies due to the poor behavior exhibited from the people I previously called coworkers. The teams are not based on merit, and it is much more a popularity contest with arbitrary MyCustomer (or whatever they're called now) reports which measure things that do not define a quality technician. CVS is all about pumping out as many Rx's as possible and ""hoping"" the patient knows how to take them, because the pharmacists sure as heck don't. Stay far, far away from this place - it's a medical emergency waiting to happen."
bad,"couple problems with my pharmacy manger she wasnt understand and lacked in human resource. Didn't care but about the employee, A stressful environment to customer, to other employees"
bad,"-not enough help/techs on to get the work day done"
bad,"-  Great prescription benefits"
bad,"To be put on a cash register with zero training and is  expected to learn the self service photo center on your own is pathetic!!!!Hrs that were promised to me were completely ignored by the store manager.Time off request handed directly to the manager were lost and misplaced intentionally!!!! District manager was concerned about the way his store manager mistreated myself,favorite personal were given more hrs based on their age and looks, Age Discrimination Is a major issue at a certain Danbury location,"
bad,Just don't do it. It sounds all so good at first but once you get out of training the petty stuff starts. Don't believe me? Apply. The supervisors will tell you one thing and then throw you under the bus.
bad,The current leadership team at CVS only cares aboiut profits and not its customers or employees. Sales goes up while payroll hours go down and wages remain stagnant.
bad,"This place isn't somewhere you wanna work at. Management sucks, they make the workplace seem like you're working in a prison. it is very hot or very cold  no in-between. They are just looking for ways to fire you."
bad,This is by far the worse job ever. The management is horrible. They do not care about their employees and they target certain people. They treat you like kids and they bully you. I had a anxiety attack everyday I went to work. This is a place I wouldn't recommend to my worse enemy!!
bad,"Employees have no voice to improve workflow, management lack communications, and there are no recognition.  A typical day at work is investigating errors and why medications were not delivered as promised.  The hardest part of the day is having to apologize to our customers and explaining why their residents are not receiving their medications."
bad,"CVS was the worst job I ever had. It started out great but after awhile, there are no breaks, no lunches, working off the clock because there is no room for overtime in the budget but yet there are loads of people waiting on their prescriptions staring at you"
bad,"Working here you think when they hire you, you are going to be full time however it is a temp job. The work place is very unprofessional and unorganized, it is a very demanding job and high stress leveled job. My best thing about working here is helping the members"
bad,"My pharmacy managers were amazing and I loved working for them.  The district manager was AWFUL and did way more harm than good. She refused to allow the stores to be staffed properly, so we ALWAYS had overtime and were written up for it regularly.  When we all stopped putting in overtime, then we were written up for not getting everything filled during our normal work hours even though it was physically impossible to keep up with the volume demands with the little staff we had and the hours available."
bad,"A very unorganized company. Huge lack of communication between employees and managers. Given wrong directions multiple times to do specific jobs, office closed in West Chester"
bad,"There is not much to like when the company doesn't care about their own employees. The are numerous reviews of this on Indeed, Glassdoor, Yelp, etc. Just save your time and work somewhere else. Money comes and goes. There are 8 Billion human beings, guess how many companies? Find people in a company that actually value your work. "
bad,"Cameras watching every move. Do not leave your desk unless you"
bad,"I do not know where to begin to tell you about this very negative place. There is NO training, Management is Absurd, And You constantly get sick here!"
bad,"Horrible place to put in all the hours that they demand.  Your store is under staffed, down to a manager on duty and a cashier every day.  They only care about customer survey, yet you don't have the tools to take care of the customers.  Blind eye to all struggles by supervisors as they preach service and reprimand their managers for poor scores.  Supervision has become a joke and they only role play the impossible and ignore the real problems in the stores.  Too many good managers wasting away in this company."
bad,"Pharmacists who drive Mercedes' to work expect the most from parttimers who are barely able to afford groceries with the wages they pay. The customers always yell. No chance for overtime or even making 30 hours. Pharmacists reschedule you without telling you ahead of time. Bad work environment, just stay in school."
bad,Insanity in fast forward speed. Run away. Run like you are on fire. It will make you nuts. Retail is the devil. Overworked is an understatement. They play favorites.
bad,at cvs you are beyond overworked and underpayed. I was there for years and corporate kept telling us they would hire new employees to help with the workload and never did.
bad,working for the company cvs was very hard and tiring. their wasnt enough techs for the day and the mangers were very horrible when it came to listening to the team and our concerns. they didnt care about our outside lives it was all about cvs and what we can do to make the company great
bad,"This experience was one of the worst of my life.  It was stressful, cruel, and I was treated horribly, as was everyone else, by my boss, the HR Manager."
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work here. Management is the worse they hold you back to keep from having to advance you when it's deserved. Don't waste your talent.
bad,"Poor management. The supervisor does not know how to be a "
bad,At CVS the job is mostly very stressful. Help is always very limited. Supervisors are mostly very arrogant. Efforts are usually not appreciated that's why nearly all employees are either leaving or strongly looking for other openings elsewhere
bad,"Payscale is very low, cheap and stingy. I'd remember I asked my manager when you guys going to raise my pay and, she said I tried but they don't want to take any      "
bad,before cvs bought omniare it was understaffed but they worked on hiring people to get the job done. once cvs bought omnicare they cut he work force to make it more like their retail pharmacies. now people with no training from other departments are having to work in environments that they do not know what to do just to keep their jobs.
bad,"I believe working for CVS/Pharmacy was the most stressful time in my whole life, the company does not respect their employees. It was not equal as well as unfair in many situations."
bad,"This company is unloyal, unfair and flat out a horrible place to work at. They do not give out raises2, they want you to come in and pay you little to nothing, while the manger, sit around and look silly have the time."
bad,"Cvs is a great place to get your foot in the door and some experience, but after working there for 3 years and getting certified, i realized there is only so far they will go for their employees. very upsetting, they promise a lot in the interview and cannot deliver"
bad,easy job but management is bad. High call volume. If you enjoy helping people this is the job for you. You may take over 80 calls a day while others take 30.
bad,If there wasn't a shortage of pharmacist jobs very few pharmacists would choose to work here. No matter how fast you work you can rarely complete all the work the company wants you to do.  It is frightening to have to do such critical work as such a pace.
bad,"Every store is different, but most are constantly under pressure to Meet customer expectation and that pressure falls on the lower level employees who are already under paid and work long hours on their feet often without so much as a 30 minute break."
bad,"I personally hate my job. I am a clinical assistant. I take inbound and outbound calls for FEP members who are insured through BCBS. Every single call is the same exact verbiage every single call. The calls that go out are automated. Majority of the people these calls are geared toward are retired FEP members. Now we send out automated calls inviting member to a complimentary consultation program to speak to one of our RPH about their medications. 98% the patient doesn't know why they're being called, they get calls from an 800 number that either 4 different possible numbers, they think it is a scam or they have no idea whats going on. This job is very frustrating. The department supplies you with more work then you could imagine.  The people on the team are very ""clique"" like. Management does not have any care or concerns for any personal outside problems (experienced on multiple occasions). Once in this position you feel like you might have found something good, but all good things must come to an end. If you are to find management in this building that actually cares about their employees let me know. Until then its job hunting time. FYI I've only been here 5 months."
bad,Worked here for four year and was terrible on my health. My physician recommended to find another job. Unappreciated by management and supervisor's sexually harass you.
bad,typical day consisted of answering phone calls and setting up patient medication to be delivered. i have learned on this job billing codes and a lot of different specialty drugs. management could be better. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the supervisor/ manager.
bad,Do not treat employees fairly. Sick leave is a joke because sick days are counted against you even with a note. Staff is not treated equally. Not good
bad,"Sink or swim with no direction or mentoring."
bad,This is stupid. I don't  owe anyone a review of CVS. I still work there and have no desire to share how I feel about it on a public website and I should not be required to.
bad,"The pharmacy manager bullies the staff, talks bad about the staff, has a horrible attitude. "
bad,It was the worst job. I dont recommend this job for anyone. They expect you to come in early and stay late without overtime pay. They expect to work every weekend and they complain when you ask for time off.
bad,"I would highly not recommend working for this call center. This occupation requires weeks of detail training. However, due to large call volume and business demands you will be placed on phones immediately. However, the patients suffer the most because of improper training. Improperly trained PSR's make costly mistakes because of poor training. Management moral is low as well. Management make empty promises and make questionable promotions."
bad,"Management has no concept of work/life balance."
bad,Beyond crazy.  The work load is unbelievable.  The environment is completely stressful. Management only cares about the numbers.  Team members are not recognized for their hard work.  Poor pay...really poor pay for the work involved. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time.  No breaks....EVER.  You are almost looked down upon if you have to use the restroom.
bad,I hated working here. Management doesn't work with you at all on school or any of your personal life. Patients in the pharmacy are hateful and very few are understanding of the pharmacy laws.
bad,"Not a good company to work for as a member of management and other store personnel . Year after year. Hours keep taken away, while tasks keep getting added to your workload. upper management does not care about store employees. We are all replaceable."
bad,Learned a lot by working with many people.  Turnover rate is very high so never got to know many of the workers really well.  Anyone can easily be hired but staying at the company for a long time is very rare.
bad,not a good place to work. they overwork you. It is not to stressful both physically and mentally. You have to be on your feet throughout.
bad,"At the CVS I work at we get no 15min or lunch break, so you better hope it's not busy. We get yelled at for things that are not in our control, like insurance not covering their medication. We get a score sheet called ""Got heart""... No matter how good you do on it, you'll get nothing out of it, trust me I know."
bad,"Hallmark Specialist and Sales Associate responsibilities. Typical day at work will be working by yourself taking care of the whole sales floor. I learned a lot about this company, how things work, inventory, overnights, and many different changes. Pharmacy is another agenda but, if experienced + trust worthy can help out in register or small situations. Management teams work under a lot of pressure, so often they change management a lot of times. You don't work with co-workers unless it's the overnight shift or seasonal setup department. Hardest part of the job is when they changed from two team members to only one team member to manage whole sales floor for customer service, sales, and duties. Most enjoyable part of the job is when some management on duty trains you to do their responsibility and get to have more hours because of more work, building trust worthy relationships."
bad,This company is insane! They should be outlawed for safety violations alone! They give you worthless reports to fill out while dumping a ton of workload on you that can't be completed  within the time frame allowed.They constantly monitor you more than the KGB while writing you up for their infractions. If you want to finish your work you must work off the clock!
bad,"CVS company does not care about its employees, and ask each one to perform to many duties while helping too many customers and consistently keep each store woefully understaffed. Horrible experience."
bad,"When you report a supervisor due to him/her asking you to nearly break the law and the supposed ""Ethics"" department from this company does not forward this to upper management or the supervisor is still creating havoc within the company, then you know your voice is not heard.  The company does not care about their employees.  This created a very hostile environment for workers as supervisors abused their power and upper management did not address these issues. Very unforgiving when it came to attendance. The company counts by the minutes, if you are late, etc. No sick leave so if you called in deathly sick, it actually counted against you. Very impersonal department in the call center in San Antonio, Texas."
bad,"O trabalho consiste em estar, literalmente, o dia todo fora de casa sem tempo para descansar ou até mesmo tomar refeições. "
bad,"it is extremely very stressful working in any cvs pharmacy store, not enough help and they always cutting hours plus they do not pay enough to pharmacy technician so no one want to work for them. pharmacist stuck with these kind of situation where there is no raise in technician pay to motivate them to do better or become national certified"
bad,"The pay is horrible, weekly hours depend on the grace of a computer somewhere in Lala land. The tech support is atrocious, so you can only guess how accurate their hour calculation algorithms are. Kiss up to your DM or face scrutiny every time you sneeze. They have trained the customer base to complain and get a gift card. Then, no surprise, they find that they only hear from the people who have a complaint. Be prepared to come up with a good way of explaining to your DM that the customers are more interested in a gift card than a survey. They've earned their reputation as the bottom of the barrel honestly. I'd rather pay more and go elsewhere, but wait - even with a drastic corner on the market, they've still got insane cash prices on dirt cheap generics."
bad,Imagine being stranded on an island alone with a pack of wolves... survival only by swimming to the next island--- required to attend meetings on days off unpaid
bad,"Triage phone calls as a pharmacy technician, data entry, and that's pretty much it.  Casual dress code, so jeans and boots are fine.  But casual mind set too.  The people there are like they dress, not professional. You couldn't say anything negative about the management, the walls have eyes and ears regularly and the management is very petty. I wouldn't work here, be warned.  Beware of dog sign at the door."
bad,"A typical day for me at work is very busy helping customers and making sure they're satisfied when they leave."
bad,No advancement in trying to move up everything is at a standstill everyday.  You do the same thing everyday mgmt has a clique its all about who u know in order to get a raise and sometimes not even that.
bad,I worked there for 2yrs the atmosphere was not great there is alot of favoritism and ppl who have cliques team work doesn't even exist there and no one has your back they  want to work you like a hebrew slave and give you pennies for a raise literally pennies and to show how much they appreciate you they give you some funky cvs bucks to buy there stuff but still no real money they don't let you advance they try to keep you in one area so they can suck you dry like the blood sacking vampires that they are. Fair warning I wish someone would have warned me...
bad,"Mind as well call the company Omni ""dont"" care. Cause they simply don't care about you. Forget about your life outside of work. Supervisors will threaten you with termination if u don't work when they want you to work. That's the culture there. Don't expect managers to help with the overwhelming work, it's your duty to stay and work, not the supervisors."
bad,"This is the worst company that a human being could consider working for.  Any positive reviews above have to be fake.  You are required to practically give blood, sweat and tears yet receive nothing but a hard time, negative feedback, not nearly enough help, in return.  Nothing you do is ever enough.  I stayed 6 years, I was moved around to suit them because I was always able to contribute to improving a stores metrics and make it one of their top scorers but still never received one encouraging word. In other words HORRIBLE management.  This is their MO.  Everyone treated as expendable.  I can not express enough how horrible it was to deal with management at every level and the corporation as a whole.  Everything from benefits to daily operations was a bad experience.  They can not keep employees for that reason. I Never met a single employee that was not looking for another job! So, TAKE NOTE OF THAT FACT MANAGEMENT!  YOU are the reason no one stays!  As others have mentioned as well, metrics priority over patient safety.  I do not recommend this company for any reason!"
bad,They will treat you like garbage and act like children and don't own up to their own errors. They will just try to cover  their butts every way possible even if it means running you over in the process.
bad,"Learned about an array of diseases and their treatments processed within the Specialty Pharmacy."
bad,"So many bad things to say about this company. The hourly rate is horrible, job security doesn't exist and management is a joke. I became certified to open the doors to have a chance to leave."
bad,Poor work environment and culture; no trust in colleagues or management. Work-load is ridiculous and exhausting. Still huge divide between front store and pharmacy from top to bottom.
bad,"There is nothing positive I can say about this company. The management is a sheer joke, they pretend to care because that's what they're trained to do. There is no sincerity whatsoever in the management of CVS; they protect their veteran employees whom hold higher positions (i.e. managers, supervisors) new employees are not treated as fairly. The starting pay for a pharmacy technician position in Cincinnati, Ohio is $9.00, which is completely laughable considering the workload and knowledge your required to know at hand. A pharmacy tech is pretty much a mini Pharmacist whom is does NOT make nearly as much as a Pharmacist. If you like being overworked, underpaid and unappreciated as an employee then CVS Caremark is the employer for you."
bad,"I only worked at the company for about 6 weeks. I had to get out of there! Daily routine for this position would require you to show up for your shift. Put everything in your locker (pockets empty, no jackets, etc) go in and grab your tools. (box cutter, sleeve, glove) You would also have to grab a trash bin and get it to your designated location."
bad,very unpleasant work environment. The management team were never on the same accord. Shifts and schuldes were unpredictable and even when scheduled it was never guaranteed that you would work all  your hours.
bad,I regret working for this company. The employees are extremely rude and disrespectful. I have been verbally harassed by coworkers on more than one occasion. Management has done absolutely nothing.
bad,"Great job for a college student, single with no kids or you have help especially if you are going to work at 24 hour CVS.  You are hired only part time at minimum wage, and strictly retail hours not a steady schedule and no room for growth and benefits for part timers are expensive and it only overs family doctor appointments. Employee turn over is ridiculous!"
bad,"........ awful. awful. awful hours, awful starting pay. corporate only cares about themselves. techs working 50-60 hours EACH because pharmacy supervisor (not in store pharmacy manager) wouldn't hire ANYONE. long hours, one half our break EACH shift.. NOT enough help. pharmacists always stressed out. I'm glad I quit when i did, store - 913. We have asked for help so many times, corporate keeps cutting hours.... awful"
bad,"love this job overall had great experience working with the customer. fun work place with supportive management. great atmosphere, love working with my coworkers."
bad,Management is disorganized and the company lacks communication on all levels. Issues that employees are having are merely swept under the rug and not escalated to HR.
bad,"My previous employment, I was a delivery driver for a pharmacy. So, when my job closed and I saw that a position at CVS Health was available as a driver.  I decided seek a position, this was the worst decision I have ever made. "
bad,A typical day at work would be i would go in clocking in at the register and then get to work with stocking shelves and making sure that evrything that was on the floor was filled
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for. Benefits are horrible management sucks. I worked there as a shift A manager and only been with the company for a year and had worked in 5 different stores. They had me in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa stores as well. The DM don't tell you this when they hire you. DM that was in my district was not a very good one. Very condescending and cold. The pharmacy was ok if you work in the right store.
bad,"The worst company to work for, always understaffed. No breaks and taking a 30 minute lunch was a battle! PIC played favorites regularly. Low pay and lots of stress. PIC yelled every day. Don't waste your time, go to Walgreens! Very little respect for employees and customers. After 6 months I had not one review and still had not been given benefits that were promised at 3 months as a full time employee. Very unprofessional. This goes all the way to the top. Everything is on a timer so it is rare that you are allowed to give the proper customer service."
bad,"I love my job but hate corporate, they exploit you, only 15 min of break, it is ridiculous. Love the staff, medicine , people, but not worth the pay."
bad,Horrible place to work.  They get you to become a technician but then low-ball your wage.  Its better to USE CVS as a stepping stone.
bad,"I worked at CVS over five years, and I was continuously denied opportunities for advancement While being severbally mistreated. I went through all channels including HR and the corporate headquarters. Bottom line is that CVS does not care about your health or well being."
bad,"Management is BAD! They have no idea what their employees accomplish. They have their favorites that gets away with everything and anything while others get questioned on everything."
bad,"CVS/pharmacy, and every other chain drugstore for that matter are horrible places to work if you are able to think for yourself and enjoy settling for being treated like a piece of trash on the street. Not only are customers unappreciative of the work you do to help them with THEIR problems, but they go so far as to blame you for issues out of your control (i.e., insurance, backordered medication). Despite the work you are able to do, higher management in the regional and corporate levels push each store to cut hours and encourage understaffed work days. This causes stress for the entire crew working as such stores are incredibly busy. The money offered to the regular employee is not worth the stress of the job. It's not an incredibly hard job, but when the work of many is left to few, it can become harder than it's supposed to be. All in all, it's not a place to work unless you're content with being no more than a worker bee who likes to be talked to like a piece of filth."
bad,The hours are very long; meaning you can't leave until everything for the day is done despite 10+ hours per day. If you have lazy coworkers then you get to your work plus theirs!  Not to mention horrendous favoritism for the males that work for them despite a complete lack or education and experience in the field. The management will do whatever it takes to make their days easier even if that means sacrificing the quality of life for employees below them. Prepare yourself for major dissatisfaction because it is doled out in heaping helpings at this company.
bad,This company unfortunately doesn't have their stuff together. Tell you one thing do another. Management is horrible can't ever get a response unless you hound them. Was given wrong information from management. They give favoritism to the ones they like. It's a buddy system so if you're not in the click you'll be on your own. Have a couple that states when they are leaving work early unapproved while some in management decides to leave half day on extremely busy days to go have fun. Was lied to when hired that no weekends would be worked when every weekend is worked. Pick and choose who they allow to have off for PTO time. Cant have any OT if you work it they make you take other days off so you dont get paid for it. Expect you to work late to get the job finished. All around a horrible place to work for.
bad,"management is horrible....nobody cares. too much stress for little appreciation/pay"
bad,cvs cares about numbers only! This company does not value its employees at all!  High turnover tech rate due to sucky pay and a lot of work to do for it therefore good techs leave and Then replaced w dummies so u have to work harder
bad,:( Terrible!!!!!! Hate this job with every particle of my soul!!!!
bad,"The company itself is ok to work for, however it doesn't come without its issues. Your experiences will vary depending upon your department. From my experience there is high turnover rate and the leadership does not seem to care about the needs of their staff. In addition the benefits are not what I expected for major pharmaceutical company to have. There is a 90 day waiting period to receive medical benefits., etc. The premiums are expensive as well. The work life balance is nonexistent during open enrollment season. Not the best place to work for individuals with families."
bad,"Good for short term, allows employees to take up other pursuits like education"
bad,This place has management issues.They switch so many managers and pharmacist its not funny
bad,"I worked here and was promised full-time hours and only worked maybe 16- 28 hours a week, depending on volume. I was always the first they let o when volume was low. Management was good, just not consistent with work or directions."
bad,Such a shame on a huge corporate. They don't value their employees.
bad,Very stressful work conditions and extremely demanding. I really didn't like being employed  by this company
bad,"This company does not care about its people.  They will work you to death 80-90 hours a week and spit you out to die,"
bad,"Poor management, long work hours and rotating weekend (both Saturday and Sunday) sucks so you basically have not life. Management call you in on your day off. People who work get used and abused vs the person who slacks off get to do whatever they want. They say theyre gonna do this and that but never go through with their promises, pay sucks even when you're certified. The management himself is not even certified."
bad,This place has always had problems but our one person who helped us with those issues and was for the employees our HR Manager they decided to lay off. Now we can't trust anyone. This place is horrible.
bad,"First off, the management is horrible. I have many problems with my joints and my back (which I have been diagnosed with scoliosis, spina bifida colta, and hyper mobile joints from my doctor) and my manager would say, ""it's all in your head. You're too young for those problems"". CVS does not care about their employees AT ALL. I would work almost 12 hour days when someone called in sick and would even help out other stores. My first raise (which I didn't get until a year and 3 months) was 27 cents. After working hard for over a year I only got 27 cents. And corporate wants to make sure everyone is trying to get the customer to purchase more items. Because if you can get the customer to buy something extra, they end up with 50 million more dollars. But don't worry, they won't be sharing any of that with you! They never hire people to help so you're always drowning, they never listen to their employees, they only care about themselves! I'm surprised I lasted the 2 years there. I don't know how some people can stay there any longer than that."
bad,"I challenge myself here I find work to do to keep moving, I have sharpened my management skills by watching the mistakes of others. We have a strong crew that works hard at getting the job done. Not being able to move through the store as much as I would like to clean and attend customers."
bad,I do not recommend this company.  Very unstable from a sales position and do not pay out bonuses as goals are achieved.
bad,"If you are totally desperate, then go work for this company. If you have any pride at all you will not like it there and that is an understatement. The management has no clue..at least the ones at the Lincoln facility..I think is was Lincoln..do not care at this point...Go donate your time at your local charity instead."
bad,Not ideal pharmacy technician job. It is a factory under surveillance.
bad,"The Orlando market is very disappointing. Their is no structure in management or in training due to the fact its all about who you know, or who you are friends with in the Orlando market.  Very little work life balance offered to any non-store manager employee.  Not a place to start a new career with."
bad,Cvs caremark worst company to work for as a customer service rep. you spend 8 hrs on the phone and every other callyour getting cursed out by a customer.No advancement opps. This is the first company that I've worked for that does mandatory overtime depending on there needs but when they dont need you they FTO ( forced time off) . u start off working 40 hrs but when fto kicks in you will average 20-30 hr per week. Hate this company would rather file unemployment then work for this company.
bad,"I have been a pharmacy technician with CVS for 4 years, and was a photo tech for a year before that. The only thing I like about my job is the actual counting out of medications. This company is absolutely horrible to their store level employees. I am constantly bullied and mistreated by co-workers, with no one to turn to. If I didn't have bills to pay, I would have quit a very long time ago."
bad,"CVS is a terriblle company to work for. In the pharmacy you pretty much make the same amount of money as someone who works for the front store and you do 3 times more work. If you want to be underappreciated, underpaid, and overwroked then this is the place for you. The only good thing I can say is that CVS is a good place to start to get your foot in the door if your looking for a long term career in the pharmacy. I dont have any major complaints about my coworkers. CVS clearly doesnt care for their employees or at least the ones that are at the bottom of the totem pole. All the hire ups, district managers, and store managers get bonuses. While the rest get hours cut and more responsibilities. Its a joke! Not to mention if you work in the inner city you can forget about having operational registers or printers that dont constantly have issues on a regular basis's. My customer is another thing that blows about this company they want you to provide exceptional customer service with a smile and yet they have cut hours, can you imagin dealing with problem customers in a very busy store and not enough support. CVS also wants you to push flu shots on every customer can you imagine CVS make 32.99 on everyu shot, and you the employee get a pat on the back for selling x amount of flu shots per a day. But no compensation for all your hard word work. CVS has a very high turn over rate when it comes to the pharmacy. But what can one expect when CVS pays you the bottom of the barrel and gives you a 2% raise every year. Ya the is an award winning company. My advice dont get sucked into the"
bad,"When it comes to collecting workers comp., it brings out the worst in them."
bad,"After working for this company for 5 years, I left with a pay rate of $8.86/hr in 2013!...Sad, I know. I'm grateful that CVS gave me a start as a Technician but I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. As a whole, the company does not care about their employees' well being. Little training is provided for incumbents. The work environment is very stressful!"
bad,"Very strict company if you make one mistake you were fired. you had managers waling around a hovering over you all day, and its hard to do your job with someone breathing down your neck."
bad,"i left feeling violated of my privacy an not having any job security at all, had a sense of releif when i left"
bad,"I loved this job for some of the fun and very nice people but there were a lot of very negative people who talked about others behind there backs. The management is minimal they really don't do or say much, they may be called managers but they don't manage anything. The hours are long and unfair. There is no set time you will be out if you are scheduled to close most nights you are there midnight or later. The pay is not worth the hard work you do."
bad,"This is a really bad place to work. They dangle incentives but make it impossible to achieve them. If you truely care about helping people (especially elderly) then you will not like working here. They do things like switch medications without their notice and it will cost the patient plenty to change it back. I have had many calls with people crying on the phone because they can't afford there pills after what caremark has done to them (auto debit their acct). Now they want to be open on Saturday and Sunday and only pay their 25 cent per hour on the 8 hours you are at work on Sunday?? Also it is well known by management that ""certain Pharmacist and Pharmacy Techs have parking lot rendevous"" at lunch, but they just turn their head.Forget it! I advise to look around for a reputable company and not apply here unless you are very hard up for a penny or two."
bad,"Job is stressful with not many options of advancement. Managers, at some stores are unfair and the company as a whole looks at you by number and always says that you are replaceable. "
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever seen. There was nepotism all over...husband/wife, father/daughter, father/son, etc. I found this to be very strange.  Also, I witnessed favoritism to certain pharmacists and techs which was very obvious. If you don't fit into their mold, you will be treated like a red-headed step-child and you will be driven out. if you do quit, they will fight your unemployment benefits until you are denied. Take it from someone who knows. They did it to me. they will give you an ultimatum to work graveyard shift and train for it for 2 weeks without compensation. This company and it's management is run by satan."
bad,Everyone is terrible. There is no moral and everything is about who you know.
bad,"Decent, experienced techs need not apply. Omnicare ONLY and I can't stress enough ONLY cares about the bottom line. The patients are just a means to an end. If you are good at your job and care about patients do NOT work here. The management is more clique like than high school could hope to be. The focus on management is to tear down the employees and then expect them to work hard."
bad,"Just like being in High School. Supervisors play favorites. If you're not with the in crowd forget it. You work like a dog and no one ever says thank you, not even you supervisors. Other employees steal from your desk and the company could care less. They hire too many people at the start of the new policy season, then they fire people that have worked there for over a year. Stay away!!! They are cruel and heartless people."
bad,The management do not treat employees well. They fire people unjustly and bully their employees.
bad,"I enjoyed solving customer problems and answered questions as to why they owed on statement. Helping them understand insurances questions. Hardest part was when statements went out you got a high volume of phone calls due to our statement were hard to read and understand for elderly people. I had a good group of people to work with very knowledgeable. Management was very poor and uncaring, usually didn't bother to show up at all. Pay raises were pitful it was hard to be paid so little and have to a high work load."
bad,The Hildebrand location was amazing to work at. However the Mt. View location was not. Poor management and uncaring staff. Love pharmacy work just not in a hostile enviroment.
bad,"I left this company after their repeated emphasis on the bottom line""$$$"" over patient care quality. The management sucks. They have too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Everyone wants to be the boss and when things go wrong everyone blames each other. No one stands up and accepts responsibility. They manage by the ""fer of losing your job"" philosophy, which did not work on me, thus my departure."
bad,"Poor values, poor communication, lack of leadership and vision."
bad,"CVS is one of the largest pharmaceutical companys in the world, so you'd think that they would care about the employees that made that possible. Unfortunately, I had a terrible experience with this company. I worked for them for 9 years and had to fight for what I believed in on a daily basis. They do not care about your values or ethical beliefs. Their main concern was the numbers and profit of the company. They were willing to do whatever it took to reach that, even if it meant you were asked to do something you were uncomfortable with. I strongly suggest to anyone who is looking for a job with CVS to look elsewhere. There are plenty of other companies that will treat you right."
bad,"Management is terrible. Company overall is a terrible company to work for! All they do is take and never give anything to their employees! Nothing is done fairly around there! Hours are not good. They have no consideration for their people, only if you work in the corporate offices!!!!! Just expect too much out of people. Don't ave enough employees for the amount of work we have, although they seem to think we do. Very disorganized work place. Too many chiefs and not enough indians!!!! And last but not least the pay is terrible!!! I only stay there for a paycheck even tho it just barely helps!!!!! Also you have nobody to go to when you need to get some help with things! HR is terrible, you can tell they are only there for the company not the employees!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I'll start off with the only good thing about this company: the people I worked with were great.
bad,"The hardest part is the sheer nature of the job. You have to put up with a lot of stupidity from customers and management. The people who you work with immediately will always be fun that's where the fun ends. You do get to meet lots of people in the community. It's what I needed when I had it, however I'm thrilled to have moved on."
bad,CVS lacks the values necessary to make its work environment a rewarding experience. A company that lacks respect for even the best of
bad,Little to no training. Constant overtime and usually on short notice. Poor treatment by management. High pressure to perform to high expectations and reprimand if not able to achieve. Not a well managed company.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working here, there’s no growth in the customer service dept..lacks skills employees are under paid very stressful environment..."
bad,They treat employees like garbage and are in the business for the $$$ not the patients.  They value business metrics over patient care and satisfaction and have unrealistic expectations that set the stage for unsafe work environments.
bad,Cvs Health is probably the worst retail u can work for they pay u good to come on board then after that the pay sucks and they will work u to death. B
bad,"Cvs is insensitive to individuals with mental illness and health emergencies. Even though I have mandated sick time, it has not been approved by management because they did not consider my situation an emergency to tend to. They don't give proper breaks and they don't give raises. They are severely understaffed and overwork their employees. There's better work out there."
bad,"Years and years invested in this company with no recognition, decreasing pay, increasing expectations, and shallow, greedy, unethical management. No ability to truly care for your patients or yourself. Recent hours cuts have completely gutted service, safety, and morale. Operates under the guise of “patient care” while truly only pushing numbers and squeezing pharmacists for the most possible output with the least possible compensation."
bad,The company doesn’t have empathy towards the employees and has a lack of humanity towards the way they go about dealing with certain situations. This is the worst company for you to work for and I wouldn’t recommend anyone working there.
bad,I worked 12 day stretches. No raises. They say they’re going to hire techs and they never do. Pharmacists have bad reputation. Mental health nightmare
bad,"I have always been a hard worker and can get along with everyone. I don't mind helping anyone. I was mislead as far as  future training for a pharmaceutical certification. I had to constantly and continually request the training I had been promised the day I was hired. I was not given the opportunity to complete the compute training portion while I was at work - it was always too busy.  I was hired 'full time' but not given the hours. I had to work every weekend (both days) many nights till midnight. I had to fight to get to work any hours in the pharmacy. There was clearly a desperate need to hire more employees but the current manager was not 'management' material, nor was he a people person. Come to find out, the training program I had been promised was actually discontinued and I was not advised by management. When you work in retail and you are constantly dealing with registers that freeze up/break/seize working continually on an on going basis week to week. That's a problem. The store had been remodeled but the registers/computers never were. We were always running out of change/money, bags, register tape, etc. Management never seemed to care about anything, nor did corporate. There is also major security/safety issues at the location I was at. Witnessed many instances of abuse directed at employees as well as customers in the store - law enforcement was called many many times. Theft alone would warrant an in-store security service on a daily basis. The store is open from 7am - midnight - lots of opportunity for wrong doers daily."
bad,Cvs corporate doesn't care about their employees....It's totally obvious from the dl .....All the way to the store managers......They all pretty much show us they have to be all about the company and not about who works for them
bad,"Move on there is very little training, high turnover and high expectations- move on either to corporate in Northbrook or another company in healthcare"
bad,"This company does not care about you. You don’t know when your shift is over until your first break. 3 hours between your start time and first break. Then 3 hours until lunch. Then you take a break an hour after lunch(as long as you’re working 10 or less hours that day). There’s no way to know what time you’ll be getting out in advance, so if you have small children, this place isn’t for you. Managment is a joke. They don’t care if you succeed or fail. If you’re having problems, you better figure it out on your own. On weeks with a holiday, you generally work 12 hour days minimum and they threaten to force you to work the weekend to try to speed up production."
bad,"Company culture is intentionally inconsistent with its own policies to avoid liability; customer service policy is not inclusive of all customers and is a job liability for customer-centered employees. Diversity and equal opportunity do not go hand in hand; it is very difficult to move up. Many in management have been grandfathered from decades old company policy because they've been with the company for so long, are often still behind in terms of remaining market competitive when compared to other employees of similar companies but still retain the operational power within the company. The company is riddled with ethical ambiguities in terms of labor laws. I do not recommend it to up and coming, ambitious, young and driven or mid life career change workers looking to make a difference and carve a decent career."
bad,This company is run by people who only think about themselves. You get little to no support and even that comes with you being talked about negatively behind your back. Very unprofessional company to work for.
bad,I worked for 18 years. All store managers I came across were all the same company never cared about there employees. Instead of working with my schedule CVS force me out made me quit. All because I needed a set schedule to do my treatments for dialysis. I am glad I left the company went to work at walgreen where Walgreens treat me alot better thanCVS.
bad,That place is a joke. Mangers there have no idea what they're doing. A lot of illegal things go on there and they're are by with because no one will report it. Stuff is so bad that supervisors and managersshould be fired for the things they are getting away withsupervisors
bad,"Management is horrible, the store is falling apart and the manager doesn't do anything about it. The manager also doesn't do their job nor help the fellow employees with tasks on the sales floor. Corporate takes forever to get back to and they do not check in randomly to see if their stores are functioning. Overall bad management."
bad,CVS thinks it only needs 2 people in front store and refuses to hire pharmacy techs so front end employees have to work in pharmacy. Nothing ever gets done the right way because there are no employees to do so. They don't want you to care about the customer. It's all about pleasing corporate which over task you. A 24 hour store is probably different but stay away from stores that close. There will never be time to complete all tasks.
bad,"BEWARE. No real benefits (sick time and vacation time basically impossible to use) no raises ... bonuses? HA. lunch breaks? what's that? Positive feedback or any ""job well done"" NOPE. all numbers driven. Upper management could care less about you. YOU ARE A NUMBER and can be replaced by someone who will work for half your pay. Never in my life have I gone home crying more than I have with this company. Techs and cashiers treated even WORSE. don't doooo it"
bad,"Toxic work environment; my shift supervisor and her pet psychic who just follows (female the store  manager) abuse and misuse their power of being given access to information on the associates;  to gossip about those very same associates to any and everyone including outside vendors, security  ...they instigate hostility by slandering associates and destroying reputation."
bad,"Tough Job would not recommend to anyone. They do not give you enough time to complete your work, yet expect you to meet very hard and unrealistic targets"
bad,"In my few years working for CVS I encountered racist managers, inappropriate co worker behavior, awful customer experiences, and terrible scheduling for everyone."
bad,"Everything was great for the first 7&1/2 years, then slowly it became apparent that their (CORPORATE) decisions and priorities were geared toward money (specifically showing the shareholders a profit) instead of the customers and their employees.  I can’t give specific details of what they did, but basically were things that cut money and increase profit like award meetings, combining positions, and eliminating high salaries. Within a period 4 months, I was written up 4 times, 2 in one day and the 3rd 21 days later in which I was fired. I had top scores in customer service metrics for the last 4 years and a loyal customer base and was a few cents shy of being “MAXED OUT” on the salary cap of a Pharmacy Manager! THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR GIVING 9 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE TO A COMPANY WHO CARES MORE ABOUT SHOWING A PROFIT THAN THEIR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES!"
bad,I worked alot of hrs. I was the only one who was able to come in on the snow days. I was super committed. My bosses both were not there very long. The one who they promoted before me was on corrective action for attend and the other one lived in PA and was late every day yet they chose them to lead.
bad,"CVS hires quickly, but in my experience that seemed to be because of the store's high turnover rate. For compensation, expect around minimum. Breaks were begrudgingly given to me. Good place to work if you don't have anywhere else to go."
bad,"Don’t even go in as a temp. You’ll be used, abused and kicked out the door when you do your best. No appreciation at all, just unreal demands! As a company they could care less about you. Look thru their bull chips and stay clear of that company!!"
bad,"Since CVS has taken over, my job has become consistently more stressful and difficult.  A huge reduction in the budgeted hours occurred, even though our business continued to grow."
bad,"I worked at CVS for 6 years. Went in on my days off, stayed from open to close, worked overtime. I was bullied and was handled with discrimination. They even opened an HR investigation and it was like they didn’t care what was happening. They did not care how much extra you do, you can be replaced. The issues don’t get resolved, even when you report it. I loved my job and my customers. They just don’t care what is happening in the store"
bad,They will quickly change your job title anytime they wish. Not an employee loving company. The CEO needs to make as much money as possible. Does not care about the under dogs doing all the work. Very sad
bad,"The whole culture of CVS has changed. From the top down they do not care about you, you are just another body working or a number. What could be an nice job, isn't, they put too much pressure on workers. For what? to be watched like a hawk while others get away with everything. Too much favoritism! People don't last. Large turn over."
bad,worked overnight shift . filling new rx and refills enjoyed dealing with customers .learned how to order drugs from wear house and  outside vendor . enjoyed  going thru patients med history and helping them
bad,The store manager tries to be everyone's friend instead of their manager. Which has it's own set of draw backs that come along with that. The best part about the job are the customers and the people that work at the store except the manager. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the store manager. You learn briefly and then that's it either you know it or you don't at that point which it will be expected of you to know how to do everything you are told not taught so you will get in trouble for that eventually. So again like the summary its just a job.
bad,"Poor mgmnt, poor work ethic by individuals. Only two people actually work.supervisors bury cashier's, freights done by cashier only!! Shelves are empty, bathrooms dirty cleaned by cashier's only. Favoritism by mgmnt.customer complaint daily, floors are a mess."
bad,i lost my sister and nephew in a car accident while working there. I was given no consideration. They did not pay me for 3 days bereavement and fired me for being late. My manager was only a month old on the job an did not fight for me. Although i did a great job.
bad,Overall CVS was not a great company to work for.  Many of the employees are disgruntled and as a result take to their frustrations on upper management.
bad,"I worked for 3 years as a pharmacy intern, and when the time comes for pharmacist offer, they did not offered me the job, but that’s not the problem. The district leader would not return my calls or emails that I sent trying to figure out why I didn’t get the offer. Simply to me that is not professionalism. I have had 2 mangers, the first one was careless about teaching me any pharmacist role, so I asked to switch to different one, which I had good training on how to become a pharmacist but sadly, I think they based their assessment on the feedback from the first manager."
bad,"The pay is good but everything else about the job is horrible, the amount of work and slaving we do I think we should at least get paid more, we have to work 6 days a week 8 hours in a warehouse that is dirty! Dust everywhere rats running around the crates we use to pick and pack have urine and feces inside because they pick them out of a dumpster .. it’s absolute horrible.. the managers do not care about you , you’ll get into trouble over the littlest things"
bad,I’ve been with this horrible company for almost 6 years now. Long story short they ONLY care about making money. Employees are all disposable. You as a person mean nothing to them except for making their numbers better. They treat their customers better then they treat their employees
bad,They force you to work overtime and if you dont want to they make it mandatory one day before and if you get approved  to go do something you have to do let's said a doctor's appointment  and when you come back next day they give you a warning or coach  you or suspend you without paid even tho they approved for you to have the day off
bad,"I have many years of call center experience with high quality companies yet they didn't have the decency to call me back or e mail me regarding my interview. I juggled my whole schedule to make their  schedule.  Maybe a good thing as there were people coming out of there with ball hats on, pants down past the waist, grubby clothes, . I guess thats who they hire."
bad,"Reduced hours forces the store managers to work 6 or 7 day a week to get everything required completed. Work alone opening or closing, but company says not supposed to do that. District Leaders say you got to do what is necessary to get the job done. NO CONCERN FOR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR STORE MANAGERS."
bad,Pay was very low and expected a lot of employees. People would always call in sick and schedules were very unpredictable. Management was very lazy and not helpful.
bad,From the top down bad management. Embarrassing as a healthcare professional to try and serve patients at CVS. Seems like hours for the technicians always get cut and you have to do 5 things at once and the customer always suffer.
bad,"Does not take care of employees. Highly understaffed . The more you do, the more they expect. Tense working atmosphere.treated very poorly. Do not recommend"
bad,Impossible expectations.    Demanding Unrealistic    Terrible.    Goals impossible to reach.     Never enough help.    Boot on the back of ur neck     One day after another
bad,I was very stressed and unsatisfied.The turn over is extremely high because they do not want to promote from within. I earned a BSBA and they still had me waiting for a promotion. 40 cents a year is the raise no matter what. A great disappointment.
bad,"Always looking out for the next candidate to replace you. If you are not part of the in crowd you are frowned upon and micromanaged each week. Stay away,  not a place where you can grow or even for job security.  Skaays on edge and constant visit interruptions. It's a work hard face paced environment that is never fulfilling or completed. You are told to help out other departments stores however no one comes to help you unless you are on re adar for a replacepers"
bad,"This company only cares about numbers. The managers are inexperienced, the benefits suck, and the environment is toxic. Favoritism is the name of the game."
bad,"Horrible place to work. They want you to do a million jobs in 5 hours. The store manager I had did not have a backbone and allowed the workers to come in late and do what they wanted to do. Being a shift lead I was held responsible when grown people would not do their job. I was written up for other people not doing their job. My question to my then store manager was...if you called the same person in and they didn't listen to you, then why are you not being held responsible. Rules are not explained correctly so you can be suspended or fired for using phone numbers for customers who did not wish to risk there information to be put out into the world, to get the sales of what ever merchandise is on sale. NEVER SIGN ANYTHING!!!!  I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy. STAY AWAY!!!"
bad,"Management was the worst ive ever dealt with,  the amount of stress they put on their employees is dangerous to ones health both physically and mentally.  They should be sued for the way management treated their employees,  not to mention the discrimination and retaliation if you spoke up."
bad,"At the end of a 12 hour day with no breaks there were 40-50 prescriptions to fill for the next day.  Ran the cash register 2/3 of the day.  Always came in early, stayed late and came in on my days off to get the work done.  The counter tops are filthy, trash overflows, vial bins usually empty and lots of prescriptions to file.  Then they cut the tech help by 50%.  Employees are treated like slaves in a toxic corporate culture.  There is more to being an employer than providing a pay check and benefits.  Would not recommend."
bad,"CVS micromanages every aspect of your job in pharmacy and puts more emphasis on sales than anything else. As a technician, you have very few options for advancement.  At current, must work at multiple locations to obtain 40 hours per week."
bad,"If you want no family life , time off an intense stress. Then by all means this is the company for you. I worked with some amazing people an some not so amazing. Cvs has totally unrealistic views as to what a person can achieve on any shift. The manager came in on only day off to receive an work truck."
bad,"Worst company to work for. Honestly all they care about is making the company look good instead of helping employees out. A lot of favoritism in the company. No place for growth, people have been there for 5+ years and still in the same position. Wage is low for a billionaire company. People come and go in this company."
bad,Hate CVS and everything that comes with it. They don’t treat their employees right and don’t give enough help to reach expected numbers which mean more than anything to them vs being humane to the employees
bad,When I first started it was a great place. 5 years ago. We had hours and management was great. Now 5 years later. Full time is considered 30 hours. And god forbid you go over 40 If you don’t have the hours. It’s like the world will end. Not only that the that the pay that you start with is okay. But don’t get excited for a big raise. 10 cents here 5 cents there. Not worth all the work they have you doing.
bad,"CVS Health was a fun and rewarding place in the beginning.  "
bad,No real benefit to this job except money. Work is grueling daily doing the work of 5 people. No help. No hours. Company could care less about you. Again pay is high but with no time off to spend it or enjoy your life. Don't waste your time. Pick any other organization over this one.
bad,"Wow, once you step on campus you are on your own, left to navigate directionless/untrained until your assigned a project realizing the skills and resources needed come up short.  Nothing like step up for failure. Better onboarding,"
bad,Not enough hours for all the work. You are not a manager. You are a stock boy that does the schedule!! The out of date policy is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen a company do.
bad,The typical job environment where management doesnt care about its employees but acts like they do. Overtime is almost always. No life balance. Work drama is frequent and management can't solve those issues correctly either. The rate system they use is the greatest detriment to them but they use it to weed out employees.
bad,"Just back stabbing adults that acts like kids alot of favorisum "
bad,"Compared to Walgreens pharmacy it’s way behind when it comes to technology, integrity following rules and regulations or let’s say the ease of the flow of work and clinical pharmacy practice"
bad,"The pay isn't anywhere near what should've been based on my medical/healthcare experience and all the state licensures I hold, they put their customers and rating over their employees well being, and you have to be employed 13 months before you can be eligible for benefits. It wasn't worth my time there at all."
bad,Poor communication with management.  Very obvious favortism with management. Many supervisor/employee family relationships. Onsite management does not follow company policy for leave of absence requests/returns. Managers do not allow you time on the clock to log into computer systems even though you are told during training you are to not log in until after timing in. Currently a class action lawsuit is being brought against the company due to not paying employees for time worked.
bad,"CVS does NOT care about it's employees. This has to be one of the worst places I ever worked. They want everything from you and give you nothing. The raises are horrible, they work you harder than what they want to pay you for, my hours were cut drastically. Avoid working here at all costs."
bad,"I've been working at this company over 15 years. The past 2 years have been the worst ever. Very short staff, no OT avaiable, under paid all the way around. I hate this job, I do. It's just easy."
bad,"Don't waste your time, under any circumstance.  Poor management, no advancement opportunities, low wages, no benefits, no fair treatment.  Again, don't waste your time under any circumstance."
bad,"Life is hard enough, dont make it worse by working for a company that doesn't carr about you. If you aren't directly making your higher ups look better then you are useless in their eyes."
bad,Literally the worst company I have ever worked for. Do not work for this company. They do not care about their employees at all. They only care about profits
bad,"They manage through fear. They fire loyal employees to hire new ones for cheap. You will get no justice there. I feel like I've gone through a war during my time there. If you want to play the Game of Thrones then this is the place for you. If you value your health and quality of life, then run away and never look back."
bad,"I'd rather not, the scores are what they are so that alone should be telling. How can a person, an adult for that matter live off of 12hrs a week working 3 hr shifts and it be ok"
bad,"I worked in the Omnicare billing office for 8 years. I loved the work I did but the management and supervisors were horrible. If you were a hard worker you continually had more responsibility dumped on you while the slackers were given lighter workloads. Recognition, Overtime, perks, etc were distributed based on who management was friends with or related to. They talk about how its a family and how everyone is part of the family but in reality its each person for her or himself. If you make an enemy of management or one of management's 'friends' then you can expect to be treated unfairly, and don't bother to report it to HR or corporate because you WILL NOT remain anonymous even though they say you will. They also say they do not tolerate retaliation but I know for a fact that management will retaliate against you if you report them or do anything that goes against what they want. Save yourself the time, stress, and health problems by looking somewhere else for employment."
bad,"Very unprofessional. No training given, unprofessional conduct in the workplace, favoritism, and their hr department wont return your calls, not to mention unsafe work environment"
bad,If you are still in High School...or just need part time...I guess its ok. They change EVERYTHING all the time. They play favorites...some people can have their phones for example while others get written up and fired..
bad,If you want to work long hours with bad pay as a store manager then this is for you. District managers expect you to work 50+ hours a week. Anyone wanting to work here my only advice is to get into an ops manager position and stay there. It is a guaranteed 40 hours a week and you get paid hourly.
bad,"This company is all about phone calls and meeting their metrics.  Technician hours slashed to the bone and if there is no time to take a break or eat at the sink, too bad in other words no scheduled mental downtime. If you want to spend time with a patient beyond the minimum you are falling behind and now you have to check other stores work on top of your own."
bad,"Begins with a lengthy hiring process with what seems like supportive management, until you start. The trainer flew through lessons then regularly humiliated people for asking questions. Manager repeatedly came in to berate the training class for issues of a few (such as quietly chatting while system issues were resolved, using the bathroom, etc) rather than directly addressing the *perceived* issues with the offenders. Very unproffesional and even cruel to deny emplyees time for a basic human function. You are a robot, not a human. And that is just the beginning.."
bad,"High stress, low pay with tiny raises. My pay was red line (frozen) years ago. The company constantly implements new programs to increase efficiency with them being untested and often non working on release day. These include programs that were to increase efficiency by reducing wage expenses and hours on the schedule, after the program failed the hours never returned. So yay for profit, but poor treatment of employees and customers. Would never recommend to any person that I even mildly liked."
bad,"Management treats employees bad. Lost prevention are unfair, there are Cats around the warehouse eating, urinating and pooping on cases of merchandise. Only clean and follow safety procedures when corporate and OSHA announce that they are visiting the building. Management brake all the rules but blame the employees for their horrible management. They're all about numbers and don't care about the employees."
bad,You would think because this is such a big company they would have a better work/life balance schedule. They want u to work like a slave and do not care about your personal life. In order to get a day off approved you have to take 3 days off all together. You can only use the bathroom 10 MINUTES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WEEK WITHOUT GETTING WRITTEN UP. Or call Hr and get reasonable accommodations. This company is pathetic will never return
bad,Low volume-no payroll-impossible to get everything done unless you run around like a crazy person which leaves no time for customer serv./patient care
bad,"You're expected to be in ten places at once so that you can clean, stock, process photo orders, and still be at the register so that no customer ever complains about wait time. The management is hands off and unresponsive, LP focuses on internal theft instead of cracking down on customer theft, and overall it's mind numbing and tedious work. There is no upward mobility  in the front store either."
bad,"You are just a number to them, corporate doesnt care at all.. my manager is worthless, takes advantage of all employees and makes the schedule based on her life. Definitely a job for part time high schoolers."
bad,"the store manager was rude, condescending, and passive aggressive towards all employees. The customers always complained about how bad the store smelled of sewage."
bad,"You will literally get depressed working here. You work so hard and try to prove yourself. Taking on more and more responsibilities outside of my pay grade but when it comes time to promote...you'll be told to ""step up"". I know everything there is to know about how to run the pharmacy and yet I am the lowest paid person there."
bad,"Very Strict company to work for with little to no flexability with ones schedule unless going to school. More of a factory feel than a pharmacy feel. Required quaotas."
bad,lets move on there are better employers ... far better companies and employers. Management with zero vision and back bone . the future of CVS is in grave danger
bad,"The title says it all. Only work for this company if you really need money. No matter how hard you work or how well you do, there are people in positions of power at this company who use and abuse that."
bad,They do not take care of their employees. Compensation doesn’t match what cost of living is. Been there for 4+ years and have not received a decent raise since I e been there.
bad,"I’ve been working at cvs distribution center for more than 10 yrs. I bid for other positions and they Give them to new hires because they don’t want to do hard work. The health insurance is really bad, there is a family deductible of $6000 and your annual salary is around $45000."
bad,"Run, don’t walk, away from this place. They lie about hours - promise you more but that never happens unless you travel around without compensation. Management is spiteful and division leaders just give out phony customer service awards without meaning. You must act as security because Loss prevention is too busy watching employees.  Horrible environment- You're treated like s Dog. No advancement unless you’re in the in club.  They switch district managers like underwear.  They don’t follow their own employee handbook. You’re pulled all over without proper training. Bathrooms are filled with hypodermic needles.  You complain but nothing gets done."
bad,"extensive training at first. Emphasis on ""patient comes first"". Soon one realizes this is a front for absolute corporate production priority pressured by management. Pharmacists and techs are trained well then pressured, burned out and disposed of. Patients free to ""go somewhere else"" if treated poorly. Managers trained in ""two faced"" methods, pleasing customers & workers short term then disciplining or disposing of ""unwanted"" for ""petty issues"", ""adjusting"" work staff to meet corporate goals."
bad,"Administration (upper) treated the whole endeavor as a money-making scheme as opposed to a health-related pharmacy. Everything related to the bottom line, including federal and state regulatory authority. Corners were cut, services were dropped, employees intimidated, and customers coddled to the point of pharmacy rule bending and breaking."
bad,Upper management does not care about employees and there seemed to be a high turnover rate because of that. Every store that I talked to was always short staffed so there were too many extra tasks without any help. I was expected to work open to close 7 days a week. The vacation time is actually pretty generous but there no coverage so you’ll come back to a disaster.
bad,"As a salaried employee you get paid for 45 hours but are expected to work 60+ a week, with no paid overtime. The company has a grind culture, they work management as hard as possible until they quit, promote or hire from outside to fill, rinse and repeat. Low payroll hours with high expectations is the norm, expect to be doing the work of 2-3 people at all times. The discount is decent, medical is high deductible but vision is good."
bad,"The company seems to be more concerned about making the top 7 on the fortune 500 list rather than treating their employees with respect and genuinely caring about them.  They required employees to use their personal cell phones for business, but never provided reimbursement.  Also the department had to work on New Years Eve every year and did not receive any kind of incentives such as comp time of additional perks.  There was no work life balance and the software systems that the company uses is very antiquated in my opinion.  Many things could be automated, but was not because the company did not want to invest in technology to help make processes flow better.   This was a very, very stressful place to work.  The pay was way below average for the industry.  However, the company would try to justify it by bringing up the benefits package and annual bonus.  Their benefits were extremely pricey which was surprising for such a large and successful company. I would not recommend."
bad,"Employed for 25 yrs and involved in armed robbery. Would not take me back due to job restrictions by CVS doctor and private doctor>"
bad,Worst company I ever had the misfortune to work for.  They discriminate against older employees.You will be sorry if you work for them. They use their metrics as a club against you.
bad,"Worked here for around 6 months and although I made some great work relationships, my managers didn't even know my name the day I walked out the door. This job requires you to work long hours and you are not allowed to leave your desk until absolutely everything you've worked on is finished, even if it means working a 12 hour day due to management sending you too many cases one day and not enough the next. If you leave your desk for 5 minutes to use the bathroom without clocking out be prepared to get called out by a manager for why you've been away from your desk. Empty desks all the time because they can't focus on fixing up the management and over pile of work given out so no one wants to stay. Be very weary about applying hear."
bad,Supervisors typically work there 2-3 years before they leave or are replaced with new supervisors. Not much support from upper management on issues. I don not recommend working here.
bad,"Honestly I have never worked at a place that is so understaffed that they just let the bad employees run around and do whatever they would like. Employees get away with making jokes about Suicide and bringing guns into the office. I am disgusted at the lack of consequences from management. Coworkers call out whenever they want leaving all the work for others to pick up with no consequences. Stay away this place is a bad atmosphere. The job itself isn’t bad just the management, atmosphere and Colleagues"
bad,The higher ups do not do anything they put the work on you. They try to make sure you don’t get a raise. I had to quit a month before I had my baby do to the hostile work environment my supervisor was very rude and mean to me. Cvs cares more about the members than their workers they did nothing about it.
bad,"No training, Support for Operations from Sr Leadership is non existent, Processes are non existent and you are just supposed to just know, cross functional collaboration is non existent, unethical sales, unprofessional Sr Leadership. Very hostile and unprofessional work environment."
bad,"A horrible place to work , demand is unbelievable, district leaders have no clue as to how to run the front end ,  communication is extremely poor . This is not a people driven company , its all about the bottom line."
bad,"A little over 5 years ago, we had 4 techs plus many front store employees. If someone called off, if it ment for another tech to have to go into overtime, it was okay. Oh have the times changed so very quickly. I could not even name our store manager, we hear it is this person or that person, but no one EVER shows up. Pharmacy had zero training for front store duties, but we were still getting calls as to why this and that is not getting done. Cut us down to 20 hours a week for the front store, yes 1/2 of an employee for the entire week, leaving the only ONE tech and ONE pharmacist to do all the tasks in the entire store, that means drop off, pick up, drive through (2 lanes), production, data entry, daily inventory tasks, assisting customers with front store needs, and not to mention the constant phone calls. We do an average of 180-200 scripts a day. I do know there was a nation wide reduction in hours, but this is leading to insanity. I currently work for them and this is why I am on indeed every day looking for something else. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."
bad,Expectations are outrageous. Two people in the pharmacy and one in front store and still want high customer service. Don’t pay enough to expect so much.
bad,"We had training for about a month in one classroom where we learned how to input the information into different databases, then we were pushed into the real thing that was nothing like the examples, so we had to learn on our own. I say ""on our own"" because even management did not want to have to deal with you to answer your question. We could not talk or make any noise except in the breakroom where even then we were so close to the floor that we could not enjoy ourselves. This shows the workplace culture and how we had to deal with every day. The work was simple but not motivating and was very repetitive to where it caused the days to be very slow."
bad,"They preach how they care for you and families but when it comes down to schedule hrs, they force you to do split shifts which if you dont take then you miss out on valuable hrs. No one with a busy family life wants to be under the yoke of woking twice; driving back and forth, rechanging into work clothes, and finding the motivation and energy to work again after relaxing and possible planning with your family for the day. They dont have profficient training, you learn on site as you go regardless of experience and only the strong survive through blood sweat and tears. Customers are unforgivingly tenacious and take advantage if you show weakness from not knowing how to do your job or if you are a people pleaser."
bad,"The job itself I loved.. Helping people has always been my forte. But with CAREMARK, you had to worry about your numbers and presenting things to members that members did not call in about. If they are calling in about themselves and what your to present is for someone else on their plan you are to ask if they are available to speak to them. Way to strict. You can’t help the members the way you should and leaves a lot of elderly people trying to figure out how to afford their medications. Also they have favorites.. if your not in the managements or supervisors CLICK then you don’t stand a chance of ever moving up or keeping your job. I personally have heard a supervisor tell a agent not to worry about your numbers i will fix it for you. While me and everyone else bust their butts to do what they say, some can just show up to work and have awesome quality scores and numbers."
bad,"""Helping people on their path to better health"" is CVS's slogan, but it ought to be changed to ""Helping shareholders on their path to greater wealth"".  This company cares about one thing and one thing only... more money for the people at the top.  During my 5 years there I saw loyal workers of 20+ years laid off to make quarterly numbers look good.  I saw THOUSANDS of patients who didn't get the medication they needed because CVS didn't want to adequately staff their pharmacy to meet the demands of the workload.  I saw the company DELIBERATELY force patients/clients to buy the MORE EXPENSIVE drug (which is against state law here in Ohio).  I saw management conspire to remove employees who they didn't like or had disagreements with.  I watched a manager tell a mother that she wasn't going to be able to take time off to spend with her daughter, even though she'd put the request in months in advance, and the manager refused to work anything out because of ""company policy"".  I saw employees who were denied PTO because management had laid off so many workers that there were no workers left to cover any vacation days.  The general manager of my particular site was not only NOT a pharmacist, but wasn't even a TECHNICIAN.  Never had any certification or license of any kind, but was telling pharmacists how to do their jobs.  All of these things are micro examples of what this company is on a large scale.  It's a rotten, corrupt and toxic company with no regard for patient safety and certainly no respect for its employees.  No one should ever work for or buy anything from this company."
bad,A typical day at work was a basic eight hour shift performing retail tasks. I learned customer service skills. Workplace culture was dull. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers who were polite.
bad,"Every retail location differs. Not all locations follow store policies on dress code, timekeeping, salary, vacation requests, and stock/pharmacy policies. If store management dislikes you they will find a reason to let you go. This happened to front store and pharmacy employees at my home store. They do not encourage store employees to try to move up in the company. When upper management does visit they only speak to the store managers, and they never see the store in it's normal condition. It's a fine place for day to day work, but don't work here if you're looking to work somewhere forever."
bad,I worked at CVS for 7 years. I don't know why. I should've left a long time ago. They do not treat their employees properly. Overworked and underpaid!
bad,"I worked in the middle of flu season and it got to the point that only the pharmacist was scheduled. Ummm...  she cant do that, so I stayed and helped until I was no longer to work any over time. The higher up didn't care that we struggled. Because of the short staff, customers where rude and hateful."
bad,"the Workload is heinous and used as purposeful Darwinism.  If you are young and healthy and strong, you can stay with the company.  Everyone else, you better watch your back"
bad,"there is no growth and when there is growth, it's to a dead end place. work for free many times, overtime with no compensation, more responsibilities than you can realistically handle in your shift."
bad,"Management is very selective about who they like and don't like. If you are liked you will get any position you want, weather you are qualified or not."
bad,"Inter-office romances drove promotions, which in essence put underqualified individuals in the highest positions of authority.  Pharmacists are often under minded by individuals who have no pharmacy experience. Pharmacists are not treated as professionals. If you are a pharmacist looking for a job that improves the lives of your patients, this is not the place for you. The company is driven by financial gain, not by what is best for their patients. Patients have been known to go without critical medications (Oncology, transplant, and HIV related medications) for months due to corporate initiating new procedures that guarantee the company makes their money, but not that patients get their medications."
bad,Employees are just another piece of equipment. Prescription count and profits are the most important. Good reviews are more important that a good job filling prescriptions.
bad,"Extremely understaffed, always cutting pharmacist and technician hours. Preaches that the mission is to help patients/patient care but does nothing to provide the tools to do so.  Zero support from higher ups"
bad,"First off the people I work with, the majority of them are great and amazing people. The problem lies with how the store is managed in a cooperate level. Our store never has any hours for extra people to hire despite us being a busy store, as a pharmacy tech who also works at the front is a major issue because I am also a college student that needs to be in school and also in need of the money so I can't be there when I am needed it I can only go when I'm available. And mind you during my school breaks I pull 13 hour days working. (I get decent money but still) The district manager also doesnt consider our store being a store where there are many Spanish speakers in the area and hires a pharmacist who can't speak the language and is demanding her too without paying for the classes or at least giving her the resources. It's just difficult to be in that situation. Plus as a part timer I get no benefits. None. So there."
bad,"Absolutely no respect to employees, and very hostile work enviroment.  Management creates negitive attitude and stress  that spreads to work enviroment."
bad,"This company is just like every other big corporation, it's all about the $$. Nothing is ever good enough.The upper supervisors favorite thing to say is ""Well the other stores can do it. Why can't you?"" They burnout the pharmacy staff and are constantly having to hire new staff because employees quit from stress overload."
bad,"Cvs is not a great company to work for for pharmacy technicians. There's no advancement available; terrible raises; decreased hours; increased expected productivity; too many numbers to meet."
bad,"CVS is a terrible company. They do not care about their employees or about the patients. The focus on numbers and money, that's it. I can't wait to leave CVS."
bad,It is a good place to start -- as long as you're willing to bend over backwards. They will hire you with no experience and will train you down the line. Treat this company as a stepping stone because that is all it is.
bad,"This company sets individuals and store management up for failure. The corporation bases everything on data lists, not what is realistic or functionable to run a store or to improve these lists. Nor is the company willing to hear your struggles and offer an effective solution to perform tasks and operation requirements hinders your ability to provide customer service.  Have an extremely busy store with high maintenance clientele and need more employees and allocated pay hours? Too bad, not until your survey numbers goes up, despite anything graded other than a 5 is obsolete. Time waited in line is too long, yet they will only give you one cashier. This company has expectations that everyone to be in 3 places and wear 5 hats all at once. Extremely stressful environment in which you as an employee are never able to please your superiors, customers or patients. This is only a snippet of the problems with this company."
bad,If you can stay away please go elsewhere... training and what you actually do are opposites!! Under stressful situations pharmacist should never loose their cool or tell patients to take their business elsewhere. Understaffed and customers just complain not one day was smooth sailing..
bad,The company continues to restructure causing alot employees to either lose pay or their jobs. The coming up atnea Acquisition may cause and increase in jobs
bad,"Work at Omnicare-FTW it is horrible. Stay away Mgt(GM,HR, PIC,&DM) is a joke. I work in billing dept. b/c they treat other's in the dept around me is ridiculous. Honestly don't know how long I will be here either since it becomes depressing walk into the building seeing this over and over."
bad,"this is the worst call center that i have ever worked for.  it is very stressful, management is not fair to their employees.  you work a full 8 hours with little to no break in between"
bad,"The Management here is horrible they have no clue on how to operate a business.Once the Management feels threatened by your knowledge of the job they do everything to get you out. "
bad,"Cvs fails to lead their code to better customer service they fail in this by hiring techs that don’t know the structure of the work flow. They expect to much from old employees that’s have been with the company for years over new employees just because they get payed less, therefore lies the problem."
bad,Over worked and under paid. Do not let you know all of the overtime on a daily basis as well as the Saturdays included. You are promised things and they are NEVER followed through. There is no room for advancement within this company with pay advances.
bad,The are 6 weeks of training when you start but it doesn't really prepare you for the job. Very little support from supervision. High stress due to call level. The work enviroment is not conducive to your health. Close contact with co-workers who are encouraged to come to work even when they are sick.
bad,"Managers and district leaders don't care about their employees, and care only about numbers. Treat employees like pawns, whilst telling us to treat our patients with ""genuine care,"" yet have no genuine care towards the employees. The only rewarding part of the job is helping others. but it's almost not worth it because of the management and their mistreatment of their own."
bad,Manager was on his high horse. Very disrespectful to me. Had no knowledge of how to treat his employees. Called them stupid and slow. Offered no help to his employees. Said he did all the work. Made everyone feel terrible. Why doesn't cvs do something about this. I put in resignation. Could not continue working with a very rude disrespectful manager. No one had the courtesy to contact me.
bad,We try to be productive but there is not enough people on schedule at the same time so some area go lacking which allows us to fall behind.    We all try to do the we can.
bad,"My time as a Pharmacist Scheduler was primarily spent calling pharmacists and begging them to do extra work when they should be off. I was part of the Target team that was taken over by CVS and the culture could not have been more different. CVS cares about exactly one thing: the bottom line. Therefore, staffing levels are inconsistent in order to increase profits. Technicians are not given sufficient hours, and pharmacists are overworked. This job would come home with me at night, as I would get calls from district managers saying that a pharmacist was not coming in or had quit, and I needed to find coverage. My stress level was very high and I found that this type of work environment was commonplace for those who had worked for CVS in the past."
bad,"I was hired as a SYNON developer to work on the RX Claim adjudication system.  I spent 2 months looking at spreadsheets and not once did I get to do what I was hired for.  The culture is 90% Indians who barely speak English. Advice to anyone starting a job there:  You must never offer any sort of personality or sense of humour.  They have none!"
bad,CVS is the unhappiest place on earth. The pharmacists are angry. Managers are angry. Photo lab is angry. Cashiers are angry. The company will not give you a raise and they will work you to death. Don't do it.
bad,work was great but my manager was a big part of the reason why i could not work there any longer. when you manage anything you need to treat your employees with respect.
bad,"I had a really bad experience working for my local CVS, the management was demeaning and absolutely despicable. I am all for constructive criticism but I was just put down regularly and talked down upon. You get horrible hours, and when you get to go in it's for only four-hour shifts. The pay isn't worth the amount of stress and responsibilities that are put on you. Corporate is always on our butts about the getting enough refills and whatnot, it shows they don't truly care about their customers but the profit they bring in."
bad,"Working a my homestore did not happen as was stated during training, which stated that positions were switched every two hrs so that one became familiar with functions of all positions. When confronted with the inequity, being that I was always at check out and not able to learn any other positions, I was basically told to sit down and shut up by the crew leader, to the point that they refused to help customers *even when they were available to do so.*"
bad,Their is no management there and no structure. No way to advance. they are not consistent in rules or values. nothing is consistent in how it is done. Depending who you are is how you get treated
bad,"Cvs is a terrible pharmacy to work for. In their defense, any retail pharmacy is. It’s all about numbers and money, they could give two craps about the employees. The hours are constantly getting cut and you can never have a steady schedule. They make you do more than you’re paid for and the favoritism is insane. The customers are crazy too so good luck with that."
bad,Mostly all female employees no men should work there at all married or single they will run u and ur name in the dirt women will hit on and u then report u to get there way. They will sleep around with men and some men there or management will sleep with other employees for favoritism. The pay is ok but no room to move up they will pick there favorites. But u do have some great supervisors and leads pending on the time of day and the moods there in.
bad,"i hated working for cvs. very unorganized company. didnt fall through with commitment of guaranteed 40 hrs a week, very inconsiderate to pregnant employees"
bad,CVS is a horrible company to work for. They do not care one bit about their employees and expect them to perform duties not related to their job title. It is very difficult to move up in this company. I do not recommend working for CVS.
bad,"CVS is a potentially a great company, but the management and leadership is poor.  CVS really needs to invest in leadership and management training.  Poor management is at the heart of everything that is wrong with CVS.  Management has no idea what their employees do.  I have never work for a company where management is so clueless about the work employees perform.   "
bad,No room for individual imitative -- it was seen as a disciplinary problem -- although the company had innovation as a core value.  No room for advancement.  Much worse was the shocking substandard health benefits from the largest healthcare company in the United States.  They provided healthcare below the minimum required government standards and chose to pay fines and penalties instead.  Paid lower than other companies for the same work.
bad,"There are some good people working at Caremark however, there is not a lot of opportunities available to move around in the company.  The bonuses, pay raises are not good at all and health benefits are expensive."
bad,Never enough coverage. Customers are given whatever they want regardless of their attitude. It's a harsh corporate environment.. not for the thin-skinned. Extremely busy all the time and we are not compensated personally or financially for our hard work. Definitely underpaid. I learned a lot albeit the hard way. There is not enough training going in and I still learn things I should have learned years ago. The culture of retail pharmacy is so hard to deal with. After 4 years I am ready to move on. New hires are paid the same as I am. That's a slap in the face.
bad,"Management is good, however there is very little room for growth. I have been in the same position for five years with little to slow changes in my role."
bad,Employees are expected to be available 24x7 even when on vacation.   Management will call you any time of day or night or weekends.  It is a culture of fear.
bad,"Needs to get a pharmacy manager who is more professional, not to  be flirting with new female employees. He degrades you when he talks to you, complains to other techs about certain techs."
bad,"In all honest, i love my job, but i hate the management style. They feel they need to have complete control of their workers 100 percent of the time, and if you step outside of the boundaries in an effort to be a little more productive, you can get pulled into the office for it. Theres little to no chance for any type of promotion, and there is little to no job security. The turnover rate is sickening, and the supervisors there are extremely pety and take things on a personal level and people have gotten fired just because the supervisor had some type of negative feeling towards the person, having little to do with anything work related. Micromanagment, hypocrisy, and unprofessionalism are the three main things i feel are wrong with this place and the workers often get blamed for the place being as bad as it is, when in reality, its the leaders who are at fault. Workers, no matter what management says, have little to no voice or say in a matter.. Sure you can voice your opinions, but it doesn't go anywhere, and if you are fortunate enough to find yourself in a leader role, you can kiss you opinions out the door, because anything you say or do that goes against anything management says is correct, you'll find yourself out the door, looking for a different job."
bad,"Since CVS has purchased Omnicare, things have went downhill. Long story short, it helps pay the bills while I look for something else. Once upon a time I enjoyed working here, now, it's all about margins and profits. No longer do I feel we are fulfilling patient needs, rather we are filling corporate needs."
bad,Too many indians with no chief! The attendance policy is a joke. A co worker can just not show up with no call and not get in trouble. Schedule constantly changing!
bad,I wouldnt recommend working for this company. Workload increases everyday. No hours to complete tasks and your constantly having staffing issues. I would never want any friends or family memebers working for this company.
bad,Corporate is bad because they expect workers to work like zombies and don't care for their workers. Upper management are elitist and don't care for store workers at all. Company doesn't allow for more hours and people to work to accomplish tasks in pharmacy. Very stressful when customers argue about their drugs and co payments when laws change and corporate does nothing to help alleviate the stress that workers receive. Pharmacy workers get little to no breaks because work load is too much to handle while corporate management get to take 1 hr long breaks and don't deal with customer complaints logged to offices
bad,"afofoas dont work there if have the options"
bad,"CVS as a whole is a good company that cares about the needs of their customers. However, there is little to no concern about the employees and the security of their jobs and or well being. The managment team is absolutely horrific. The only way a person can advance in this company is by way of ""who you know"" not ""what you know and your credentials."
bad,High clinical department turn over due to corporate and local management and working conditions causing low morale. Corporate office has scrooge/penny-pinching mentality. Office managers do not treat staff as professionals.
bad,over worked and underpaid they run you ragged and pay you trinkets . a horrible company to work for . empty promises lazy manager that expect underpaid hourly employees to pick up their slack
bad,"Organization going through political change. Focus on getting more from mergers and acquistions deal and less on employee development and driving change in a collaborative manner. People not very skilled at what they are doing and leading to politics , lack of trust and direction. Very poor at technology and slow to move forward positive change."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, poor management, lack of follow-thru, no support from management. Poor working environment / culture. No  motivation or incentives."
bad,"I tried to give the benefit of the doubt, but the management just wasn't up to par. Apparently there is a lot of movement in the company within management and this never works for the benefit of the regular staff."
bad,"Management encourages ""discriminatory"" behavior."
bad,Extremely unprofessional. Every supervisor imexpect 2 has favorites and management lacked the knowledge of the work place environment. They were so busy that when confronted about favoritism denied the allegations. Hardly investigated into concerns. They micro manage like no tomorrow I’ve never felt more like a child in a work place environment
bad,The management is very unprofessional and shows favoritism. Hardly ever give incentives. Haesly show appreciation for their employees dontttttt apply!
bad,"Poor management, very little technician help, hours are constantly being cut while demanding more programs be implemented. Management only cares about metrics.  They are not interested in growing any of their employees professionally."
bad,"Fast-paced, never recognizes employees, not paid enough for workload, very stressful job, management was not well suited for the manager, not many enjoying parts of this job. Treats employees very unfairly. A typical day is attending to customers as needed and sorting labels and counting pills. This job is very repetitive."
bad,"Every department is different, however the area in which I worked, my direct manager, as well as his direct management did not have the skills or education to lead properly. The training is non existent and for those that have the desire to learn quickly and effect change, it si extremely difficult in the culture created in the sales force."
bad,"Great management but i think their wages are unfair for the limited resources that are given to us. The annual raise , top is 20 cents...! Wow.. what a great way to show appreciation."
bad,"Do not apply to work in the call center in monroeville, pa, they give pto but good luck getting approved to use it. They are open every holiday so if you plan on working there plan on never seeing your family. Insurance is decent but again good luck getting approved for the pto to use it. You are treated like a herd of cattle, looked down upon by management who huddle in little social huddles and offer no managerial support. If you are not a minority good luck getting a promotion. They give ""intern positions""  where one does the job of a supervisor at the pay of an agent, Tons of red tape to do ANYTHING, HR is on site but any HR issues have to be called into a call center with incompetent agents answering the phone,"
bad,Managers discuss your business to other employees. If a manager is  mad at you there will kick backs. The managers are very disrespectful. They do not pay well at all.
bad,"this job is fulfilling in the healthcare aspect, I do enjoy the relationships I build with patients and the healing process for them, but this company does not treat employees well, feels unappreciated, overworked, and underpaid"
bad,"Staff is usually unhappy and stressed.  Demands are set way too high, not enough staffing.  Many mistakes made by pharmacists due to increased responsiblity. Management has an ' I don't care attitude.'"
bad,"CVS Pharmacy is a very quick pace environment. If you do not know what you are doing you will fall behind which can mean you get a pile up of customers or you get hundreds of prescriptions to fill. I had never worked in a pharmacy before, and as for training, it was not the best. Before actually working in the pharmacy you go through hours and hours of online and in person training. You do a bunch of modules, then go to a group training, and then go to one on one training with a trainer who is 9 times out of 10 not at the store you will be working at. Then once you get to your store thay expect you to know everything there is to know about pharmacy and medicine. Maybe some stores were better than the one I worked at, but there were only about 2 people who were actually willing to help me without getting an attitude. A lot of the people who worked in the pharmacy were also not very nice to work with, and it made the environment very hostile and not fun to work in."
bad,"If you are certified at the state level, other pharmacies and companies pay $14-$17. CVS does train you to get your license so that is a perk. But you will only make about 10 bucks starting off. Not worth it in the long run. They will hire you part time but work you full-time hours if your availability allows. Because if you're full-time they have amazing benefits. But they don't want to give them to you."
bad,Very High Turn Over Rate. Lots of Favoritism. Promises and expectations with not actual results. Certified and Registered Pharmacy Techs doing the jobs of Customer Service Reps. Little to no Tech duties performed during the course of the day. Lots of inconsistencies through this location in every area. Though it only been open for almost 2 years (Feb 2018} still would have expected some growth. A lot of unhappy employees there and this makes the atmosphere none conducive. I've been here since the location opened. I dread going to work everyday.
bad,"Its a horrible place to work were management has literally no integrity at all. Many collegues are faced with harrassment , demeaning management attitudes towards there workers,  even if your store is scored at the top of your district or region...."
bad,"Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible place to work, management cares nothing about you, Not enough parking, Strict, stressful, monitored calls."
bad,Trash bro over worked underpaid raises are few and far between worst company to work for in the united states start paying more and maybe people won't leave.
bad,"Honestly don't have a review, but in the beginning it was cute and now it's a slave ship with mandatory overtime and 10 minute personal breaks allowed per week so yeah nothing to say."
bad,"Management is horrible, pay is horrible. They will work you to the bone with as little help as possible. CVS would rather pay the fines and minor lawsuits than just provide enough help to get all the work done. They charge the most for their medications and pay the least. You have to work for a year before being eligible for fulltime status. Their insurance isn't very expensive but the deductibles are HIGH. It's only gotten worse the longer I've worked there. They will pay for your certification test though."
bad,"It started out as a very promising place of employment, my interviews went very well, I was told they observed major holidays, I could receive as little or as much overtime as I desired, would be able to study for Tech certificate to receive in a timely manner.. "
bad,There are no words to describe this company. I have worked here for 3 years and it is one of the worst companies i have ever worked for. They don't care about their employees at all. This company is huge yet they don't pay their employees next to nothing for what they deal with especially in the pharmacy. I can deal with stress but there's a difference between stress and being miserable.
bad,"I do Not recommend work at CVS. Due to really lack of management and very bad HR department. Also low pay with no care about their associate.It is stressful, demanding job not worthed at all."
bad,"A typical day at work is I come to work, do my job, and go home. The workplace culture is very negative and impersonal. Two personality characteristics I do not possess. Favoritism is rampant. If you are not on the good side of the managers, you will not be acknowledged whatsoever. I mean they will literally walk right by you as if you do not exist. The hardest part of the job is literally being an employee. I look forward to the day  when I leave. Long story short...look elsewhere for employment. DO NOT APPLY."
bad,This company doesn't offer work/life balance. You have to work on certain paid holidays when you should be spending time with your family. No incentives to keep you with the organization. This company does not promote education.  The average tuition reimbursement for a fortune 20 company is $5000+.  This company only offers $1500 tuition reimbursement and benefit offering is the same as their retail segment.
bad,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR!"
bad,"They constantly cut hours in order to pocket more money for themselves. Which leads to tech having to do the work of 2-3 people, which isn't possible. A busy store shouldn't have 2-3 techs in the pharmacy when there are 4 stations that need to be covered, plus a million other things to do. When you work here you're either stressed or stopped trying. Pay is pathetic, hours are ridiculous. Coperate needs to get its morals straight. This isn't fast food, its peoples health."
bad,micromanagement to its maximum. Very insensitive to family life and health & well-being of the employees. A culture based on favoritism and not based on merit and education or experience.
bad,"CVS is one the most horrible place to work at. There is no humanity. "
bad,Unbelievably stressful work environment dictated by an unreliable system. Their never ending list of Daily/Weekly/Monthly tasks are impossible to complete.
bad,"The amount of work they require of you is absurd. Running from station to station and customers always complain but theres never enough workers, the line is to long, why isn't my meds filled already, why isn't anyone picking up the phone. the company always comes down on the staff but fails to see that there system for scheduling is horrible and that they can't keep employees because of the low pay and high demand they have for perfection in a unprotect flawed system they give us to work with."
bad,"I've heard other branches are not like this one so I have to cite management for how this one is run. The morale is awful and good people are leaving out of frustration. No communication, no advancement, extreme favoritism, overtime given to the favorites and denied to those who are buried in work. The raises are a disgrace for the type of work we do plus the volume is overwhelming."
bad,"poor management"
bad,"if you are an un experienced tech go ahead and apply, but if you have experience dont bother working here. they work you like crazy and the pay is very very low"
bad,"I worked for Coram many years ago so it might have changed, although I doubt it!  Coram is a large beaurocratic organization that seems to churn out many reps and clinicians.  Many of the reps that I have connected with over the years have left to move onto other opportunities or different roles."
bad,"Poor management issues with not treating people the same. Also, it can be extremely stressful at times dealing with rude patients due to things that are not the techs or interns doing."
bad,This company will never correct it's self...employees leave on a regular...don't waste your time!! Managers don't even know the busy...you will never have time for family... very childish behavior!
bad,"Low pay. Bad management. "
bad,Not a job for me. I didn't like the people or the work that i did. i dreaded going to work every day. They were always looking over my shoulder to make sure i was doing what i needed to be doing .
bad,boring  no advancement     upper management only cares about themselves  no training  very difficult to get answers from anyone   a billion dollar company that still relies on the 80;s technology
bad,"Career advancement is sparse, pay is dismal, work environment is often understaffed and stressful. New employees are compensated at higher rates than employees that have worked for the organization for 10 or more years."
bad,It is a hard compnay to work for if you have a family.  with this company they need to have people who make it their number one in life and i was not able to commit to that!  I have children and am a single mom.  I love working and i especially love working in a pharmacy. I loved who i worked for in the pharmacy and even in the store. however district made it really hard to do my job and love it after they informed me i had to make it my number 1 priority.
bad,"very poor leadership, minimal training and the work environment can be very stressful due to the lack of communication and boundaries set for employees"
bad,very stressful working environment. Slave driven workplace. TOO much expectation and big load and ridiculous amount of work on pharmacist's shoulders. People have to work off the clock to finish the daily work tasks.
bad,I didn't last 6 months! The worst job I have ever had. Cold (had to wear gloves in the summer) no support from management & verbally abusive patients.
bad,Always expect more with less and ties your hands at every pass.  Management does not support worker efforts.  All resources are very stressed.
bad,"they have been paying me the wrong amount for half a year and don't wanna pay me back for all they owe me, the just always have perfect reason and excuses. every pharmacist and technician is miserable every location I've worked or substituted hate their jobs and life."
bad,"Don't get enough hours "
bad,"After 6 months of employment myself and 1100 other employees found ourselves without jobs. The story told to the public was not the real story... Our jobs are being outsourced to India to save a buck, meanwhile our CEO banks over $12,000,000 a year."
bad,"Certain Pharmacists were great to work with, while others were quick to leave the store for better advancement. None of the new Pharmacists wanted to help the techs."
bad,If you want a job that acts like they care but really don't great place to work good money but very very poor management and not much room to advance unless you play there game and only care about yourself.
bad,I had several employees that were not very professional with me showing very poor communication skills. Too many duties were assigned to me. I attempted to transfer but the manager turned my request down. I ended up leaving.
bad,Not a good company to work for. The only thing managers are concerned about is numbers. they dont care about their employees at all. Benefits are okay management suck. Abusive.
bad,"Enjoy working in a busy company. Needs some improvement in management."
bad,Every day employees would be harassed by Pharmacy Manager. Employees would come and leave daily. When employees would try to talk to store manager they got the run around. Bad management.
bad,"I will summarize it in a very simple term, the top do not know or care about what the bottom is doing. That could also mean that the left do not know or care about what the right is doing when it comes to their employees. They over work their employees with no help. All they care for is money."
bad,"the pharmacist run you around like a chicken and a tell u what to do and they just stand there and watch, no team work in the place at all and the corporate office has a budget that have been cut and all hours have been cut. All full time employees don;t get 32 plus hours. The CEO of CVS gets all bonuses and nothing for the employees. Employees are to get a 2% raise every and I have only received 3 for all of the hard work that i have done. I have learned everything there is to know and i feel like i cant grow with this company and i used to love my job, but now its like just get up and go to work and do your shift and go home, My co- workers are lazy and don;t do as much work as I do, and  the management do help as well, where i work is S.E. dc and the people are so rude, call u out your name and  want to fight you. They will wait for you when you get off and fight, this is a high crime area and they steal everyday and shoot people. Working at this location I have to be on my pins and needles because you never know what is going to happen, I don;t recommend anyone to work for CVS."
bad,"Upper management does not care about their employees, and often is manipulating and secretive if it benefits them. Employee morale is not a consideration, neither is work/life balance. Employees are used up and burned out."
bad,"I was given the opportunity to train as a pharmacy technician. I went to work everyday focused and ready to learn what I needed to succeed. What I did not know was that I was working with  very unprofessional and extremely pathetic individuals, which in turn made it a huge waste of my time and money. I was not recieving proper training from my pharmacist and was then accused of not being able to perform the job. On top of that, you have coworkers who want to argue and make a fuss all day rather than working as a team to get work done. Now, Ive worked around some hard headed people, but wow.. I must say this is the first time working with a bunch of monkeys. Even the store manager could not step up and resolve issues, but instead, sides with the pharmacist instead of figuring things out for himself. So you have someone who is ready to do the work and take on the challenges, but you have little children running the place."
bad,"WARNING: if a cvs is opening in your area, DO NOT APPLY. maybe it was just the one i worked for, but I was used to set up the store and pull in new customers and then kicked to the curb. I was blinded by higher pay than what i was used to, which led to me being used and thrown away like trash. I mean what store manager cuts hours and turns around to hire two new techs. After not being scheduled for a couple of weeks and returning to an all white staff in the pharmacy when other people of color were let go....HMMM..... Before I was let go they tried to transfer me to a store in a bad neighbor, which had been robbed twice within 2 weeks of opening.....i hardly go to that neighborhood to shop why would i want to work there. I guess it takes being scheduled 3 hours every other week to know your days are extremely numbered and you're going to be cut soon."
bad,"Working for CVS was the most frustrating, exhausting experiences of my life. And had they not been so stingy with hours (making it easy to work around my school schedule) I would not have stayed nearly as long as I did. "
bad,"I typical workday consist of a moderate workflow with a good amount of customer interaction. In this job you will have to learn how to deal with the public. Most employees have no sense of time management, urgency, no sense of priority, poor attendance,no dependability, and lack of care and knowledge. The hardest part of the job is having to pick up the slack of others that have been allowed to slack off or choose to hand off work that they do not want to do."
bad,"en mi opinion muy particular considero que no es la compania que uno se imagina, pues las horas no llegan a las 40, cada dia exigen mas y la paga es bien mala, ademas la mayoria de los lideres y DM manager se tapan entre si para despues ser ellos los veneficiarios en las calificasiones, bonos, y buenas recompensas cuando al final los cajeros y supervisores son los que en realidad hacemos el servicio al cliente."
bad,during my time here i realized all the categories of people from the ones who just hang around to the ones who took there job very serious as they should have been there should have been no reason your workers does not come to work to the fact you putting all the intern who was barely use to the environment themselves
bad,"Where do I start?  On my first day out of training a manager tried to get me to write an email to human resources because an employee (employee X) said she was too loud in too close proximity to him. This manager (mgr. Z) told me, “I’m a manager and I should be respected like a manager.”   Mgr. Z also told me, “I don’t want you asking employee X any questions because employee X is not on our team.” Meanwhile, employee X is constantly belittling mgr. Z saying she is ghetto and how bad her wig looks.  Employee X even has a cup with a hand drawn picture of woman with a messy wig and asking for donations for the bad wig cause. Flash forward in the days ahead and mgr. Z was threatening other employees with write ups if she sees them talking to employee Z.  All the while, I am forced to sit between these two individuals. There were constant instant messages & emails floating around the room between individuals who are either trying to get you in trouble or get you fired.  One such message floating around suggested that I didn’t know how to pronounce the names of medications, yet this multi-million dollar company does not have the phonetic pronunciation of drugs embedded in the reading materials or the disclaimers and no one there seems to know what a call flow or a workflow is.  Customer complaints are abound regarding the service and calls are not monitored. They will pull a call from time to time when there is a discrepancy, but calls are not monitored regularly which is desperately needed as I overheard people using four letter words on the phone.  The demeanor of employees is"
bad,"This job was one in which I did not plan on making a career of, but I enjoyed it while I was there.  No job is perfect, but many of my managerial skills were utilized."
bad,Enables a lot of knowledge but is a lot of work as well. Overall good company. Good benefits. good WFH benefits as well. Mostly very helpful coworkers. Always a lot of work to keep busy.
bad,"laziest employees rule the work place, hardest working employees always get blamed and are assigned double the work to make up for the work other are not doing."
bad,"Worked at this company for 1 year with promises of getting benifits after  being lead around the full time it turns out 5 months prior the ""system changed"" and neither my pharmacy manager or her boss knew about the changes packed my stuff and left after that."
bad,"I love the profession but the way para staff  kiss PIC's you know where  , very annoying. Learned with a company like this just do the bare minimum  and just try get along with the coworkers , so at least you get to enjoy your lunch breaks , forget about mandates breaks, the scheduled para help is not enough and customers are mostly spoiled.  You complain to customer line , they shut you up with a gift card."
bad,Beware when you reach a certain age and salary despite outstanding performance you will get tossed aside. The culture of caring for the employees and engaging them is reflected in the high turnover.
bad,"Typical day at work consists 1 or 2 techs doing a 5 tech job; Pick-up, Drop-Off, Production, and Drive Thru. Their always understaffed and techs are overworked. Customers are not pleasant and the Pharmacist is not required to help do tech responsibilities and depending on what pharmacist is available one can guarantee that the pharmacist will not help. "
bad,The co-workers and the customers even the Pharmacy manager was the worst part of the job. I was treated like I was no body and like I was a little girl.
bad,"Chaotic and stressful atmosphere. Customers who call are either caregivers or patients themselves. In the enteral division most these patients are terminal. As if the job were not stressful enough, the management staff was terrible. Extremely demeaning and demanding. All they cared about was the bottom line over everything, patients and employees."
bad,"No real training program. Too much office politics. The wrong folks in the wrong positions. Management should use bi-directional communication. Extremely high turnover. Do not get to know your co-workers, they will not be there long. "
bad,"I like meeting appreciative customers, joking around with co-workers, and learning about pharmacy procedures and the different types of medications. I do not like the fact that CVS encourages its workers to do nearly everything for the customer that the customer can do for his/herself. Some customers can be rude as is to be expected in the realm of customer service. It can be a stressful working environment. At my store there isn't a lot of help. There's not one task that any tech is assigned to do. Everyone does a little bit of everything whether it be filling prescriptions, typing them in, calling insurance companies, or ringing up customers. Be prepared for days where the phone is ringing off the hook, customers are flying in like locusts, and things that can go wrong do go wrong!!!! The pay isn't great and at times, I feel as though I am being taken advantage of. Management makes things even more difficult by cutting your hours. This is a part-time job which means no benefits :("
bad,"The Troy Michigan specialty branch is a terrible place to work, however it's not the work that makes it that way. The management is terrible, unless u happen to be in their good graces. It's very cliquey and childish, extremely unprofessional and they are very condescending. There were times when I said Hello and the manager would turn and walk in the other direction.  So disrespectful. Management team once both took Christmas Eve off and made all the hourly employees work until close.  AVOID WORKING HERE."
bad,"no room to advance in the company, management didnt know anything or how to do anything, nobody is happy there. everyone was happy when they got laidoff even tho management promises you that you will have a job"
bad,"Horrible, cheap company to work for, poor management, favoritism, "
bad,"I was in a, what cvs calls, ""challenged store"". We were always understaffed and extremely busy. Everyone including myself was always stressed out because of how busy it was and on top of that we had duties to complete every day. The DM would come atleast 3 times/month to see how things were going and obviously would see things weren't great there so his only answer to the mess was ""ya'll need to follow kpm"" ...how are we supposed to do that with only 3-4 techs during flu season?! The only thing I loved about my job was my co-workers, they made the day go by fast."
bad,"It was a month before I even started ""training"". Training consisted of classes that were 4-8 hours long where I  would fill out workbooks at a store that was not my home store. The rest of my training was completed through modules online or at another store where i felt I was just a warm body to hold a place. After a month I still had not actually completed my training. "
bad,Never have any hours really. Maybe 10 15 a week. Then you do wayyyy to much for 8/hr your the janitor the cart attendent change signs security etc worst company to ever work for
bad,Not every enjoyable experience. Had me changing locations every 2 months and spent an ridiculous amount of gas.Overall I did not enjoy he experience and would not recommend working there. Not enough payroll to do the workload.
bad,"Very stressful, Little to no support help from other pharmacists or techs.  previous employee. Not recommend it.  It was difficult to get all your work completed with No help from other pharmacists or techs.  I would highly advise not to work for CVS.  Only pro was your 20% discount, but their prices are, so high. It barely off sets this"
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy and was under paid for the work we do. Raises are terrible and even if you're certified the pay still stinks! You get a half hour lunch with no breaks and on weekends you work a 10 hour shift with no breaks or lunch!!! They expect you to do to many things at once, and this is how mistakes are made. They DO NOT care about their customers or employees. They are cheap and won't hire additional help. Look elsewhere for employment, take my word!"
bad,I've learned the basics in Pharmacy Technician. When I first applied I loved my job. I enjoyed working with some of my coworkers. Besides my experience being there it was ok on certain days and other days it was a mad house.
bad,"""Revolving door"" Not supportive or patient. They talk about team work, but there really isn't any. Was hopeful and excited, but they managed to kill that in a matter of months. "
bad,"The hours are scare, a lot of favortism, the pay isn't that great compared to other pharmacies. Feel like I can do better somewhere else."
bad,"Worst place ever. Management sucks not just at the work place but corporate also. They don't care about you at all. A lot of favoritism there. Also Managers rather sit in the office to gossip and ask each other what to have for lunch rather than to help their employees. Never seen such a bad work environment like omnicare before. It's supposed to so call  ""be a team effort"" but there not one team effort working there. Plus they over work you but don't even pay you enough. If you're desparate try it out but if your not look somewhere. This place is really bad."
bad,"Tried hard to get a job here thinking it was a fortune 500 company, but I would advise to look elsewhere. There is an atmosphere of fear and intimidation from manager. I spoke to a company HR person on the phone and then went into work only to be confronted about it by my manager in a private room. Retaliation is the name of the game here.  I was supposed to be enrolled in benefits the first of the month following hire, but they still have not corrected this more than a month in...no benefits. I was told I was 2nd shift, but have worked all times of day and night averaging over 50 hours a week and the schedule changes often at the whim of the manager, so good luck trying to have any personal life. I have already given my 2 weeks notice after only a few weeks. Absolutely horrible."
bad,"I'd never been more glad to quit a job. After working at 4 separate stores it was clear that there were systemic issues originating above the managements. Severe lack of hours for staff, poor pay, constant hounding to get more CVS card members, and a general feeling of being behind the times (consistent bugs in the  registers, registers being incredibly slow, archaic inventory management, etc)."
bad,"This job experience has not been the best one.  I was hired as a Pharmacy Tech and took all the required classes and training.  Its been over 2 years and I am still listed as a front store employee but I work as a Pharmacy Tech.  "
bad,lack of training and direction makes it hard to perform job in the fashion they are requesting.
bad,Not investing in technology for the whole company.  They'll go the way of Kmart
bad,"The CVS 'culture' is more unprofessional than you can possibly imagine. I use the analogy of military training, where they break you down to build you back up. The difference is, at CVS, they don't build you back up. It is their plan not to. It is their plan it break down the pharmacist mentally and undervalue and under mind their professionalism because after all, CVS doesn't view their pharmacists as an asset, but an unwanted expense. Changing their name to CVS HEALTH is a huge front for something that couldn't be more non-health oriented. If they wanted their pharmacist to take on more of a health-professional role, they would staff the pharmacy to accommodate. They can afford it, have you seen the stock lately. Pharmacists are constantly drilled to achieve daily script counts that are impossible because we cant MAKE UP scripts. We are constantly told that we 'CANT AFFORD TO LOOSE A SINGLE SCRIPT'  One of the most unmotivating things corporate can do to its leaders is to set goals that are consistently unrealistic and unobtainable. Therefore the CVS culture became inventing new ways to cheat the system and make your numbers look good. We are told to check with other stores that have good numbers, but low and behold they have all been fired due to illegal activity no doubt. The supervisors never would have let someone go who was making them look good with good numbers. "
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone, either on the store level or Corporate level. Store level employees are extremely underpaid with a slim chance for advancement. The stores have a revolving door.  People come, people go.  They don't stay long.  On the corporate level, the Management is so poor and self centered that they don't recognize the employees below them.  The people that I have had the experience with working with are great, all of the management has been weak.  If you are one of the unfortunate ones that come in as a temp employee, don't expect to be hired permanently.  CVS doesn't hire temp employees.  They don't want to pay for the benefits."
bad,"Omnicare is a terrible place to work! To many chiefs and not enough Indians. The supervisors are power struck, there is no work balance. A typical day is coming to work to be criticized about what you do and don't do. They NEVER have favorable comments about the great job you do. They will threaten your job and tell you to look for another job if you can't get the work done. They have a point system meaning if your not at work on time no matter what the circumstance is you will receive a point!  7 points and your FIRED! They will pile work on top of work and expect you to get it done no questions asked. Save yourself and continue your job search. There are jobs that do appreciate you as an employee."
bad,"I am currently working at Omnicare, In the Order Entry Department. I type hundreds of prescriptions a day and help fill medications in the warehouse when help is needed. After a couple of months working there they had hired all new management and a lot of co-workers were leaving due to the lack of staff and the heavy case load that was given. I am leaving due to my work schedule. I work till 12 at night in a very unsafe environment and being scheduled to work 7 days in a row most times. I am looking to start new with a company and start my career path for  a great company."
bad,"CVS is not customer service friendly. only wants staff to make a certain number of telephone calls, and is unreasonable in the expectations of time completed and sold of waiting prescriptions"
bad,Customers are disrespectful and so are the coworkers. Not a good place to work if you are a nice person.
bad,i work here since June 2014 they never tell you that your on 12 hour days 5 days a week and 6 hours on Saturday. there rate system is a joke am a picker. I have been in martial arts since i was 8 years old am 49 now and cannot make rate on a 8 hour shift. i start of at a 105 rate and end up at a 70 for the nights out. i have seen 12 people get fired within 3 weeks because of rate issues and they where for the most good workers. this company needs to have a union know D ought in my mind. now i know why at orientation they tell you straight out when they hire you we want no union here REALLY? WHYS THAT? because the place IS NO GOOD. if you get hired here don't aspect to make it they will fire you after 90 days. whats funny the supervisors cant even make the rate themselves what a joke. they told me 90 days of training i had to sign a paper after 2 weeks because i was not making rate yet really? don't waste your time here find a better job. trust me AM leaving soon and cant wait to leave. and yes i run my BUTT off here also i grew up on a farm so i know what hard work is all about trust me you will not make it at chemung NY as a picker.
bad,"The pay is not good for all that you have to do there. They are some great pharmacist and techs and they are some horrible ones, just hope you get lucky and you get to work with the great ones like me. Management is to controlling"
bad,This place is absolutely worthless to work for unless you have excellent oral communications skills and don't mind working in the call center. I was only there for 3 days working under an agency. They are very strict with their expectations and guidelines. They had no decency to tell me to my face that they are letting me go. They called my agency to let them know. Good luck to those looking to work there because I do not recommend it.
bad,"The staff as far as supervisors and other ccrs are great but, there is little job security not much loyalty at all. They patronize you with coloring sheets and cheap gifts and snacks for your hard work. I love the concept f the business but the delivery is horrible. Helping elderly people on a regular basis can get tedious and the stress levels at work dont help. The constant reminder of stats and rules and regulations that can change at a moments notice can be a thing to deal with especially when you aren't being compensated for your work."
bad,The hardest part of the Job is dealing with non-English speakers costumers. but I still try my best to help them understand.
bad,Supervisors are constantly scolding the employees for better score and percentages.
bad,"CVS/Caremark was initially a great place to work but when you realize that the company is so big that no one really cares or knows you exist, it doesn't really make you feel good. Money is decent but that's honestly only because this pharmacy benefit manager is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in the country and they have enough money to pay. Unfortunately, you're going to be in this position for as long as you're a number to them."
bad,Retail drugstore chain. The Rx dept is really where the company shines. Otherwise the front end's primary focus is less on customer service and more on sales figures and customer data collection.
bad,"One of the worst decisions of my life was staying with this Company for more than 6 months.  I was underpaid from the beginning and promised raises that never came.  I worked my way from being a Cashier up to Pharmacy Technician.  I completed 20 hours of on the job training at other stores and another 30 hours of online modules to become a Certified Pharmacy Tech.  I was supposed to be paid as I completed the training. Most of the payments came weeks later and some never came at all.  One member of management promised me a wage raise to a specific dollar amount once I completed my training, but that never came either.  I was then promised that my one-year review would bring a large raise to compensate me for my promotion and patience.  The raise was supposed to be $1.25 and was actually only 59 cents.  Even after all that, I stayed another month. It was only when I was asked to help new co-workers that I had enough and quit.  Because they started as Pharmacy Technicians (not cashiers that worked their way up), they were getting paid more on day one of employment than I was 13 months into employment. I had been in the Pharmacy for 7 months getting paid as a cashier.  I never missed work, constantly picked up shifts when asked, got along with all of my co-workers and yet was paid less than brand new members of the Pharmacy team.  Makes sense right?"
bad,"The managers don't care about their employees, only the mighty dollar.  You are busy all day and aren't given much technician help. You always work a 12-14 hour shift."
bad,"There are/were peopled employed within the company who had certain health reasons that would require them to miss a significant amount of time at work. All had followed the process to getting their FMLA paperwork submitted, but it always seem like Caremark was saying dr. didnt submit all required information and documentation needed for approval. The requested information would then be submitted but they always came up with a reason why something has had to be done again. Due to this I know a few people who have resigned from the company or was terminated."
bad,"a typical day there is non stop answer the phone, push , shove, stuck off in the corner. "
bad,"I worked at Omnicare for about 6 months in the IV Dept. The manager is a very nice guy, but should never have been a manager. He was recently through a divorce and tells everyone this, even during their interview. I found this very unprofessional. The rotating schedule in the department was horrible. One week you will be working 7-3, the next 10:30-7, 11:30-8 all the way down to 3-11:30. It makes planning things or having a good work/life balance nearly impossible. The department is always short handed. The manager gives some employees free rein to come and goes as they please, yet rights others up for attendance. From the time I started here until I left, there were 4-5 people that had come and gone in 6 months. It’s like that with the whole company. They don’t pay people enough, expect people to work over time all the time, and the place is just poorly managed all together. The Narcotics Pharmacy Manager and District Manager were both let go in the time I worked for the company. I would not recommend the place to anyone, unless you really need a job and could use the over time. On a positive note, I learned all about IV pumps, IV medications and patient charting. Personalities here range from lazy, I don’t care attitudes to the hard working attitude... the place is so stressful I saw another employee start crying more than once."
bad,"As a Pharmacist I ring more register than prescription. ridiculous paperwork and worthless metrics you are measured by. Not enough tech hours and no support from clueless managers looking to cut help to pad there bonus, motto is we don't CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER stressful"
bad,"Omnicare is a joke! I'm not even beating around the bush here, I don't know how they are a company that has lasted this long. First of all, they offer false promises. They advertise a rotating schedule with overtime and working every 2rd weekend, but when they schedule you, they work you a mix of every shift and every other weekend, if not every! By the way, don't plan to get your schedule in advance, they post it a day before it's due to start, yeah, nice. Second, make sure you are perfect and know everything about pharmacy order entry, because if you don't, or you don't catch on right away 100%, you get yelled at every day, multiple times during the day. Not too mention, the RPh's won't help you if you ask for it and they will make a huge deal like you're a burden to them. Third, there is no work/life balance. Even when you're not at work, you are at work because that's all you think about. You NEVER receive ANY feedback on your performance at all. You practically have to beg them to tell you how you are doing at all, and you're a burden when you do. Or, they will wait to tell you a million things that are wrong at once after you've done them like a month ago. Another thing, don't expect to make friends at work. All the employees give you the cold shoulder and make NO effort to be nice to a new hire. You can feel the darkness when you go in for an interview. On the flip side, they do pay decent and offer good benefits, and that's about the only thing worth working there, besides the experience on your resume."
bad,"It was a great company to work for 5 years ago and earlier.  Now the upper management is terrible.  The worst I've seen in 20 years of service.  All they want is high target numbers, so they get the big bonuses.  They have no regard for the hard working employees.  We don't stop all day long, hardly have time to choke down a meal.  Yet managers want more and more.  They should work a week in our shoes.  They do not express any sincere appreciation to the employees.  Got to get out of this company as soon as possible!"
bad,"Horrible management, employees back stab in seconds. Micro managers, zero appreciation. Raises suck, oh they are a couple dimes really. Cheaper than cheap company, executives make the cash."
bad,"Having worked for a previous chain, before a CVS buyout, I found CVS to be far less employee friendly environment, with an archaic pharmacy database system. The company itself is more interested in getting more work out of less employees, than getting quality work from content employees."
bad,"It all depends on where you are but in general, CVS treats pharmacists like dirt. There is zero respect for your knowledge and professional opinion. They want you to spend your time calling people and begging them to fill prescriptions they do not need or want. You do not get breaks for meals and if you dare try take them, then you do not get your *waiter* prescriptions done in time, thus lowering your scores. This causes your DM to cuss you out a little more and threaten your job. Every day you receive hate email and faxes from your DM and Pharmacy Supervisor. When you are actually in the top for something, rest assured you will never hear anything good about it. You never have time to actually take care of the customers that are there. They do not provide nearly enough tech hours and when you want a vacation, they tell you that week is full. You would be better off working for much less money at a hospital or independent pharmacy than to reduce yourself to the lowly status of a CVS pharmacist. I remember in pharmacy school, the professors always said if all else fails, you can work for CVS for a while. I now know what they meant."
bad,a typical day at work was just talking on the phones. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help the customer.
bad,DON verbally abusive to staff. Upon quitting me and other employees have not gotten last pay checks.
bad,"Management is offensive and rude. Was denied basic civil rights of bathroom use, due to management not wanting to cover cash register. Demanded to see a copy of transcript from school to prove time requested off was not for ""playing hooky."""
bad,"This company management style has baffled employees time and time again. They have no clue, and they promote based on Favoritism and not on qualifications or skills. The morale of staff is very very low, and there is no one to go to, to address concerns of staff. payroll calculations are too often miscalculated, and you dare not question it or you will become a target for dismissal. The rate of staff turnover is very high. Complains to corporate falls on deaf ears, so you are pretty much on your own...take it or leave it. And some managers and pharmacist sleep on the job all the time, while pharmacy technicians are on their feet for their entire shift ! You dare not sit down !!!"
bad,Needs better Business Leaders!!! Its Monkey Work. And No ONE knows what the --- to do!! My every man for their self! If your looking for something short term this is perfect. Please do not make this your career. Its a joke! The most enjoyable part is when I clock out!
bad,If you need a job. It 's good. The employees are great but the pay is not.
bad,CVS? CareMark Dismiss employees as if the do not care about them. They consider themselves above the law. They certainly advise against filing unemployment. they tell you it's useless to file due to the fact they have the best Lawyers to fight claims.
bad,"If you have children and family, wrong place to work."
bad,"pharmacy managers have no respect for employees.do whatever it takes to cover their own behinds.irrational when it comes to decision making.excellent at terminating employees.Helping employees in need with back up support,forget it.will hire somebody else.if you dont believe me,ask around."
bad,I did 200 hours of my intern hours at a CVS/Pharmacy. Working with very friendly people made it a bit more at ease to learn and becoming multitask at all the responsibilities that need to be done. learning to input information into the system and also filling the prescriptions. I enjoyed interacting with the patients and helping them answer and resolve questions and problems with insurance and/or their medications.
bad,"Be prepared to pay attention your work, poor management, there is big talk about the culture and values, but these are all words."
bad,company does not support it's managers or their pharmacist. Only cares about the dollars they can make. Loves to work professionals many 12 hour days.
bad,"I never knew which store I would be working at. I would drive to the location I thought to be scheduled for the shift that day, only to find out I was supposed to be at a different location two districts over. It was frustrating because I applied as a pharmacy tech and was told to have been hired as a pharmacy tech, but when I started the job, I was hired on as a cashier. This meant I could not do the things my license allowed me to do because my job title was not up to the required pay-rate. Part of the reason they switched me from store to store so often was because of the promise of a promotion to pharmacy tech with each new store. That never happened."
bad,"no help, yet thet give no hours, cranky pharmacists, no ethics would not reccomend this place at all !"
bad,"The work was fullfilling, Helping people get there bills straightened out was great satifaction, dealing with insurance's was a challenge. I learned great time management and self satifaction of a job well done. Management was very poor and we never had meetings of any kind. Took months to get a review. My co-workers within the 7 person office for the most part were wonderful. The hardest part of my position there was dealing with a very disfunctional Manager. And last but least, I enjoyed knowing what I was doing was helping the elderly as that is my passion to help others and be a team player."
bad,Hardcore evil pharmacy chain
bad,"My short time with Caremark (Scottsdale, AZ) was by far the worst job I have ever had the misfortune of being in. I was Clinical Services in the Prior Authorization group for approximately two months, and in that time was on my 3rd manager. Decisions were made in silos, without inclusion of key stakeholders. Over promises were the norm. There is a reason that they are a 1 star rating with CMS. While I was there I saw people doing things that they were in no way trained for. I saw a 6 sigma black belt doing data entry on drug pre-approval requests. I saw people APPROVING these request that were not a RX or a certified assistant. If you have ANY OTHER CHOICE, I suggest taking it."
bad,"Having worked very deligently as a Temp, hoping to be a permanent hire (as was told temp-to-hire work), I was to be disgarded after 22 months."
bad,"We spend a large amount of time at our workplace, so it's a necessity to enjoy the time spent there. Unfortunately, this is not the case with me. I drive to work with tears in my eyes. I silently cry all day."
bad,"I have worked for this company twice and both times have been awful. This company just does not pay no matter what position you are working at. I worked as a clerk, photo lab associate, and a certified pharmacy technician. They all paid the same $8.00 per hour wage. This is pathetic considering how much schooling a pharmacy technician has to go through and then becoming certified and state licensed. Avoid this company!"
bad,Always understaffed because they cut hours and putting team under a lot of scrub out because they expect team to meet MANY goals with no staff and no hours
bad,"Pharmacist call the Board of Pharmacy on each other creating a toxic work environment.  You are not allowed to use any professional judgement, unless in falls within the policy.  Pay is good and they will have golden handcuffs on you.  Don't do it."
bad,"No work life balance, task are not obtainable unless you work 60hrs a week. All store are understaffed and in need of more payroll hours. CVS roster guidelines make it hard to hire to your business needs as you end up scheduling people 4-12 hrs per wk."
bad,"Management is a joke they dont listen to your problems, the new red head boss thinks she is the bomb, supervisor kaela harrassed her employees so many people have quit cause of her."
bad,"I worked for CVS for many years. Worked my way up from shift manager to Store Manager. I loved my employees. However, upper management has unrealistic expectations. We work with minimal payroll hours, often times working completely alone and the expectation of what you are supposed to accomplish is ridiculous on top of ringing the cash register and helping customers, and checking in vendors all at the same time. I am a hard worker, I took pride in the appearance and performance of my store, and I wanted to happily help my customers.  I just simply could not get everything done without working extra long hours and cutting into my time with my family. I stopped being in control of my schedule, who was working for me, and how I ran my store. Everything became micro-managed and I eventually got fed up and put in my notice. After over a decade at that company, no one even asked me why. There was no exit interview. No feedback required. Just ""leave your keys on the desk""  I would not recommend this company to anyone. They do not value their employees, they only care about bottom dollar."
bad,"Depending on who the manager is, this may not be the job for you, because there is a high turn over rate and you will be over worked and rarely given a raise. Favoritism is shown throughout the store and you’re penalized if you receive an SRA, in regards to resolving an issue with a customer’s coupon or if you override too many coupons, even if they have met every criteria and the system still rejects it."
bad,"Company does not offer advancement. Yearly raising are. Very poor. No HR office at local offices.  Company excerpts people to drive to work in very bad weather, they do.not close for hazard weather. No place close to go to eat and get back in a half hour lunch. They have nounch service."
bad,"CVS is a company, from my experience, that feels like they have thier own interest in mind.  They offer opportunities but do not really support the pharmacist in reaching said opportunity."
bad,There is a lack of communication and a lack of responsibility at my store. The store manager should be someone you go to for help or suggestions but ours is lazy and doesn't care.
bad,"13 hours a day as the only pharmacist—no breaks, no lunch, and in many stores not even a restroom inside the pharmacy. This is the bottom of the barrel of retail pharmacy—at least after working here you will gain appreciation for ANY other job you take with another company. CVS is singlehandedly destroying the profession of retail pharmacist."
bad,"This company does everything they can to show you that you don't matter. If you like having your hours constantly cut, doing the work of four people in one shift by yourself, being written up for customers not buying Carepass, nasty stores that corporate refuses to put money back into, mold and mildew, leaky roofs, carpet covered in various bodily fluids, and constant micro management from corporate, then CVS is the place for you!"
bad,"You are a cog in the machine ,,once they are done wearing you out they replace you. The entire machine is a ""good ole boys club"" if you don't buy into their politics and kiss the upper management tails then you will go nowhere. Many solid managers over the years who constantly hit their numbers and ran great stores were dismissed because the college boys in their cubicles knew they could find someone cheaper to do the job"
bad,No work life balance...has gotten progressively worse in the 20 years I have with the company....front store hours have been cut back so much some store managers are the only front store employee in the store for 20 hours a week yet they are expected to get all company tasks completed...average store manager works 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day...no support from upper management and now they are going to be cutting hours again
bad,"All is good at first, in the interview process it was all like we really care about work-life balance. Then when you are working 75-90 hours a week. Then if you try to take time off for a family event you get raked over the coals because, OMGoodness, something wasn't perfect while you were gone. And if the shaft district lead can be unethical and also have calls to the Ethics Line about his issues and nothing ever done. Two faced."
bad,It’s okay if you really need a job but you can’t trust anyone working for this company . Management will hype you up for advancement and then fill the position to get you to work harder where they need you to
bad,"My time at CVS was not happy. I loved the customers, and the majority of my co-workers. But the management was never kind, the pharmacy staff was not a part of the workplace culture and was often cruel and rude, not only to other employee's but to customers. I was threatened when i got sick and could not come in, and I heard from others that they came in sick, throwing up in the office because 'that was what was expected of them'. For a company that promises care and compassion, they don't give that to their employee's in my experience."
bad,"Under staffed, numbers driven, management has no power, customers have been spoilt and are now rudely demanding, unrealistic goals, continuing education is impossible, constant modules sent our way with no chance of doing them, untrusting senior management, LP guy has more power than necessary, tardiness is an issue but no records are kept unless they want to get rid of you, bullying is an issue that is not corrected"
bad,"Extreme multitasking of drop-off, production, pick up, drive thru, phones, consults, doctors, patients, immunizations, corporate executables managment with more things coming down the pipeline."
bad,"I worked here for less than a year overnight, and it was the worst experience of my life. We were robbed more times than I can count, and we were always blamed for the robberies. But perhaps the worst thing was when I expressed to my manager that I couldn’t continue working overnight due to medical reasons, I even had a doctors note  expressing why. He said he’d move me to days soon, but two weeks later I was still working overnight, which wasn’t the worst part, the worst part was that I found out my manager had told everyone my private reason as to why I couldn’t work overnight. I found out when they started asking me about it. it was completely humiliating. They also didn’t train me on all the store policies, and I eventually ended up getting let go for not following a policy I wasn’t aware of. "
bad,"What a dishonest company. First, they lied about the job ad(s); secondly, they bait and switch you by luring you in to apply and when it was time to start work, all of sudden, your position/role is something else and the hours are far from ANYTHING close to part-time - more like part/part-time. I had to walk out of the job and drove home without saying anything. It was rather discouraging, dishonest and devaluing of one's self."
bad,sink or swim type environment and I mean this. Many classes start w/approx.. 40 pp. and once the class room training of I believe 6 weeks is done and pp. are moved on to the floor they leave fast. The supervisors always find reason to not promote and they get away with even if you complain. A terrible place to work
bad,"Poor management, lack of communication, understaffed as turn over  is high. "
bad,Never was offered help from pharmacy manager to further my ability and knowledge of the working policies. Instant disliked from the other pharmacist due to the accusations of intruding
bad,"A typical day at work you will do everything by your self, you would not have help, pharmacist sometimes work by them self and tech have to do every thing else the job of 2 people"
bad,This place is horrible  I don’t understand how a business can be run the way that this company is run. Always understand and overwhelmed with work. It’s ridiculous.
bad,"I have worked as a Supervisor for over 4 years.  CVS seems to always look for ways to save on budget but, yet they continue to open new locations."
bad,"I worked there for 5 years and was a shift supervisor for 4 of them. The only reason I got promoted to shift was because someone got fired. That's literally the only way to move up in this company. My manager stole $200 cash money out of the safe, on camera and nothing was done. I turned it in to our district manager, the internal snitch line and called the loss prevention guy directly. Nothing was ever done and she is still with CVS in a managerial position. This is NOT a place you want to spend more than a couple of years at, at most. Like if you're a college student or just need work experience to pad your resume`. I was a front-end shift so my time may have been different than the pharmacy techs but they were always complaining about generally the same things as us. Everyone was apathetic and no one wanted to do more than the bare minimum. Oh and about 6-7 out of every 10 customers were complete jerks who just want to hear themselves complain or were just too dumb to understand a rewards program (extracare card, anyone)."
bad,"CVS is a very fast paced, stressful place to work with mostly poor management and the work expected out of each employee is much more than most retail establishments and for salaries that are a little less than competitive."
bad,Extremely high stress job with very little help to the point where it is dangerous for both my own sanity and the safety of the customers. Management cut back  on tech help but added more responsibilities on the workers.
bad,"Was let go so district manager could bring in his friends, and more so of my race and I called hr and no one would help me. Now the store that I was at my ex coworkers are now being let go. It’s just sad how u could work for a company and get no help from the company higher ups,  if your not an butt kisser or a friend of someone the things that go on. I just wish I was helped and not ignored, I went from providing for my family to struggling to put food in my kids mouth"
bad,"Every paycheck will be missing hours here and there and when brought to the attention of store management ( there is no hr) they will blame system glitches, very high stress, pharmacy managers have no management training, if your store is running good the district manager will relocate that manager to another location that’s struggling. This will then cause your store to struggle when they bring in an inexperienced intern / new grad to replace them."
bad,"Must love the taste of cheeks to succeed here. You will not only be treated better than the rest but you’ll be able to get away with anything your heart desires.  You want to stand around and talk all day, that’s fine. You can even be as loud as you wish."
bad,"no support"
bad,Long hours . No work/life balance. Bad management. Disorganized. Rules perpetually changing. So much frustration. Bad/no raises.management will not actually do anything about workplace problems and if they are even brought up you are accused of being a troublemaker.
bad,"Constantly told we fail and we fail because the company fails us. The tools are not provided to do the job we need to do. Unless we as pharmacists find a way to stop the company’s treatment of us, we are doomed."
bad,"Work ANYWHERE else. "
bad,CVS acquired this company..avoid it at all cost.  Don't answer your phone for this company...its all a scam for insurance money and to get you medical information....
bad,"Omnicare was the best job I ever had. When collecting Medicare funds from SNF's that they received from Medicare, I learned that they would not let me or my staff collect from hundreds of facilities. Omnicare Mgmnt was allowing the Facilities to keep the Medicare Funds to retain the business because they made so much money off of Medicaid from those Facilities. Obviously this is Fraud and when I brought it to there attention I was told to keep my mouth shut if I wanted to keep my job. I brought it up again as I did not want to be involved in that Fraud and I was terminated. Senior Management received bonuses off of sales not collections. It is called unjust enrichment. Horrible Management and lots of Fraud."
bad,Double standards they will let you sink before they tell you that you're not performing at level. You get easily through under the bus and when you make complaints it backfire. Lots of favoritism they don't favor minorities unless you kiss butt.
bad,"This company expects its pharmacy to run on one pharmacist and one tech in many stores. The hours are never consistent, some weeks would be 40 hours, other weeks only 8 hours. Corporate treats it’s employees as numbers and not human beings. This company doesn’t care about its employees or its customers. It’s an awful place to work"
bad,"very stress place need more hrs to run these stores"
bad,Forget about dealing with human resources they are located in the Philippines and all they do is give you a run around. That is ridiculous human resources should be in the United States &c VS should have a company to go to in each state. But it's non existent and bad shift managers. Not trained well.
bad,"I worked graves. A typical day, (night), may include 'load night' where the products come in and we have to distribute them all to the proper aisle. This is being done while another employee is primary cashier, helping any and all customers that come through the store. Straightening of the store is being done throughout the entire shift. I learned a fair amount about money and the scams that can be done to obtain it. I learned about how to spot when someone is stealing. The workplace was high strung and stressful; co-workers on edge due to thieves. One of the hardest parts of the job centered on the homeless and addicts that would frequent the store. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was when one could have a positive connection with a customer."
bad,This company has been sued for not paying its employees correctly for overtime. They are on the low end with pay. High turnover rate. Very messy environment for the call center
bad,"Initially I enjoyed working at CVS as an overnight retail employee because the pace was steady, I enjoyed my coworkers, and the pay was good. However it became clear that one of the managers had a habit of mistreating the staff in the store. This included berating myself and my work, assigning work that was meant for her to myself, being excessively rude to customers, accusing me of things I hadn’t done, and not to mention showing up 1+ hours late to her shifts. This continued for months until I finally approached my store manger with my concerns. The store manger then patronized me suggesting that professional immaturity was the reason for me to believe that her actions were inappropriate despite multiple complaints from other employees and managers. Following that discussion I decided to terminate my employment there because it became clear that CVS was more interested in keeping a manager who was able to work overnight shifts than the actual environment and wellbeing of those employed there."
bad,"My particular store was poorly managed and never dealt with the in-store issues that was ongoing. Lied about my hours in the interview process and once hired in and few months passed, hours changed to the worse. Co-workers had bad attitudes, racism, gender bashing, and back biting. Management never dealt with ALL these issues and so I took it upon myself to just give my notice. Highly stressful job upfront and in the Pharmacy too. Unorganized, unprofessional, and management played favorites. I loved my regular customers but became a war zone in that particular store."
bad,CVS is awful to their employees and expects too much of them without offering better pay. Always understaffed with too much work. Pharmacy is even worse. Don't bother with them.
bad,CV$ is about money not about positive workplace culture.  A typical day normally entailed processing 500-600 scripts with limited staff. Corporate is completely out of touch with the 'little people'.
bad,"If you like being blocked from moving up because nobody else in your store is reliable and your District Manager is an idiot who will berate you and your team for calling the cops on a customer who threatens to kill you and your coworkers , then CVS is the place for  you."
bad,"Terrible place to work. They work you until you can’t take it anymore and do stress leave. They don’t care about employees, very cut throat. Managers are catty and talk about employees."
bad,"CVS is all about the bottom line. They do not care about safety at all. I am a moderately busy store. In the summer they cut our tech hours down to less than the store hours. It is nuts to work that hard for you patients. There should be laws and regulations against this practice. They also MAKE you do stupid busy work...like action plans and huddle with your team. Also, if you have a meeting FOR CVS and you have to miss a day you work, they make you make those hours up. So you work double and do not get paid.  This is the same for holidays. If a holiday falls on a day you work and your store is closed, you have to make that day up. Even if they consider it a paid holiday."
bad,I didn’t handle it well but I should of went to corporate for the lead pharmacist at the time was a bully and I just left I should of fought back through proper channels
bad,Pharmacy says you are aloud breaks but works to not give you them. Must give up your whole life in order to get full time status. Which means never knowing when you'll be off or working week to week. Always changes to suit them. Even when you have full time status you are not guaranteed full time hours. So good luck if you pay rent or have other bills to keep up with on a regular basis. Managers are pharmacists that have not only no interest in being managers but also don't get proper training. The result is poorly run pharmacy. Pharmacy techs trying to manage themselves and others with no authority. Complete chaos in almost every store.
bad,"CVS does not care for their employees and there’s always shortage, benefits aren’t there. Hours are trash, and the training isn’t good. No one knows how much you know so it’s hard for improvement."
bad,You will not get 40hrs a week even as a manager.The yearly raise is split between The store so it will never be a great raise. CVS will routinely cut hours while increasing workload
bad,"lots of hours cut, corporate demands still raise, even though they cut hours drastically. The company seems like they will replace techs and pharmacists in a few years."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working there. Management staff is a mess and don’t believe in a system. They treat you horrible and still expect you to have a smile on your face FOR THE CUSTOMERS. It’s an stressful environment.
bad,"Management is not the best, disorganized, chaotic environment.  Training is minimal at best, you take inbound calls from members.  You are micromanaged, constantly, time off is very difficult to get, there is mandatory overtime during open season, but none the rest of the year.  In consistent information it given to you because what was the case today is not the case tomorrow.  Work culture feels like you are constantly being set up to fail.  Tons of favoritism.  Changing of supervisors is a constance issues and each one supervises in their own way no set rules to follow really. One will write you up for something but the next one does not even care about that issue."
bad,"Awful workplace setting!  Not enough resources/help to get work done.  You go home tired every night so no healthy work/life balance.  The management is awful!  However, pay is good.  Nothing positive about CVS."
bad,"If the manager you are working with gets along with you, you should be okay. If it is a manager you cannot get along with, you need to leave or transfer to another CVS location."
bad,Poor upper management. Company acts like they care about employees but they do not. Employees are expected to juggle way too many tasks at once and shifts are constantly understaffed because corporate would prefer to cut costs by cutting labor. They also try to keep employees under a certain amount of hours to prevent them from receiving full time benefits and pay raise and then employee is disciplined if they go over hours in attempt to finish all assignments and tasks and also disciplined if they failed to complete all the unrealistically work load.
bad,"I worked there after graduation because there weren’t a lot of options. I was hired in 2007 and became Staff Pharmacist in 2013. If you don’t get in the good graces of upper management ASAP, CVS can break you down. I had 6 supervisors in my 6 years as pharmacist - none of them knew me personally - I was just an employee ID number and whatever was written down in my employee file. Patient safety was severely compromised and continues to decline as budget cuts result in skeleton staffing and poor morale"
bad,"I first worked for CVS in Texas and it was stressful.  No life/work balance, raises were pennies if any.  They expected you to stay late off the clock to help.  Transferred to a Lansing Target/CVS and the situation was better but not the company.  They offer awful benefits and only if they give you enough hours to keep them.  And when you do get them, you dont get enough hours to afford them.  You have to go a whole year to find out if you keep or get your full time status.  And the vacation policy is a joke. If you dont keep your full time status (which you dont find out for a year) then you lose at least half of your vacation."
bad,"The job of a pharmacist with CVS Health entails nothing clinical at all. The job is purely predicated upon metric-driven success, as CVS operates under the unofficial motto ""accomplish more with less"". Year after year, the company decreases the hours you have available for staff, while they perpetually expect you to exceed your previous year metrics and performance. Expect countless patients to complain of how they despise the constant, nagging phone calls from the system and your staff, and don't plan on having an opportunity to eat anything during a shift ever unless it's just a simple protein bar."
bad,"The manager is pretty good with accommodating schedules and they are made 2 weeks in advance but if you have open availability you will be taken advantage of. They cut hours a lot, pay isn't great for the amount of work you do there. Maybe get a 10-30 cent raise after 1 yr. Very stressful work environment especially during flu season. Demanding customers low pay"
bad,Long hours. Thankless job. High targets to reach. Hours budget was a joke each week. Way to much inventory coming in each week. Mice issues in stockroom. High turn over in Front and Pharmacy. Poor morale. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"I worked there for over 7 years. Run like heck before you apply here. Supervisor and employee turn over rate is very high and for good reasons. "
bad,"to sum it up briefly, no training, poor work conditions, understaffed and overworked. job titles don't mean anything. I was a supervisor but, realistically I was a cashier , a stocker, a janitor, customer service agent, stockroom Clerk, operations manager, a beauty agent, a pharmacy tech, and 10 other jobs."
bad,"Upper management drives results in a punitive manner. Extremely stressful with minimal support staff creating patient safety concerns. An extreme number of tasks are assigned to be completed daily but then in a personal review was told to ""be less task driven"". Company policies and promises of open door reporting are a farce and only upheld when beneficial to the companies agenda."
bad,Being a store manager is a nightmare. Hours are terrible and are cut consistently. As the leader of the store you are considered an exempt employee but ring register and stock for 90% of the time you work. You have to mix in the management for the other 10%. Pay is decent over 70k a yr but the stress and bs are not worth it.
bad,"Salaried Manager.   70-80 hours a week when they continually cut payroll.   Techs made more than management -Front Store  open 365 days a years 8 am-10 pm "
bad,"Higher up management does not care about their employees, just the numbers. CVS continues to buy and pay for new programs while not paying their employees what they deserve. They give you the run around with higher up positions. Keep you guessing. If you rely on this job for your living, good luck. Struggle city."
bad,Management treats their workers unfairly and doesn't appreciate the hard work they do everyday. Always made unrealistic goals and pushed us too hard. Played favorites and trashed the new hires and pressured most of us to quit do to poor management.
bad,"I worked at the call center in Nashville. They are totally prejudice against caucasian. They were alway listening in the phone line to try to catch you in a mistake so they could write you up!! Plus give them a little authority, oh boy look out! Dirty, stinks whoo especially on hot days.Very Very poor management."
bad,"Worst job i ever had. Incompetent management, scheduling sucks. If you call out for good reasons or just call out in general. They take it personal and give you dirty looks the next day you go in."
bad,What you are hired at is what you will make in 10 years. The only way to get a raise at this company is to make them notice your presence and then leave. At that point they will contact you with a raise.
bad,"If you’re looking to be depressed, overworked, understaffed and payed next to nothing, this job is perfect for you. Worked with the company for 7 years and loyalty means nothing to them. I was a shift manager and I was constantly doing the store managers job so she could sit in the office and do absolutely nothing. I was the one who did her payroll, scheduling, the only person who did resets and every other odd job that she didn’t want to do, while she always strolled in late, left early and didn’t do her required 45 hours and leaving everyone else to pick up her slack. CVS as a whole, is just as bad. The company is so cheap even though it’s a multi billion dollar company that they don’t give the stores enough hours to properly run a store but expect so much done and to meet a certain standard that’s unrealistic. I was lucky to have 2 people on a shift with me at a time and a lot of times if there was a call out, I would be by myself for a few hours until someone could show up. I was expected to do a large reset while being a back up cashier, having to scan in vendors and take care of any other thing that comes up during the day. I worked almost every lunch shift because of all the stuff I was required to do, even on my days off, I was constantly being harassed by text messages and calls from my store manager. There’s no work/home balance at all.  There’s no resources available for stores and when asking the DM for anything, we just always got the same answer, to figure it out. At one point all the managers in the region made only 50 cents more than a cashier but had 1000 times"
bad,"The employees are for the most part, ok to work with. In order to advance, you must pass the pre-sit class. But you can still be passed up by someone who hasn’t taken the required class needed for advancement. As long as that person is well liked by their superior and they’re already being groomed for the next step up. The pre-sit is a waste of time and energy. Also, full time employees work part time hours. Some come in at 6am and only work 5-6 hours a day. Depending on how the volume is for that day. Same goes for 7am people. There have been many times employees are told not to take a lunch because of the amount of work. Also, THERE’S NOT ENOUGH WORK! But there’s a constant revolving door of people coming and going. The pay for the amount of work you’re expected to do is unjust. Management wants you to multitask and learn more and strive for more but will not pay more for all the things you’ve gained knowledge of. The job is discouraging, stressful, and the employees are for the most part, unhappy. But hey, it’s a job, right?"
bad,CVS used to be a good company to work for.  The company has grown and now is too big.  It's too big because everything revolves around the stock price.  CVS only cares about the bottom line and not the people that are the face of the company.  Payroll budgets have to decreased to an amount that it is unsafe to work in a retail setting.
bad,They hired me as s shift supervisor. They kept me on cashier the whole time. They lied about training me and management took all the overtime. They were trying to find ways to fire me and won.
bad,This is not a good company to work for. Management in particular is the worst. Pay isn't great and they treat the workers as if they are not the ones doing the work.
bad,My biggest regret ever was choosing to work for CVS. Without leaving to much detail into my specifics I can just say violations were occurring and management knew. They did nothing. Poor ethics. Poor service. Poor values.
bad,"Over work you! No hours ! Too many patients for being 2 techs!!!! No overtime, company doesn't care about their employees. Nor for their patients....."
bad,"we are filling 300 + RX with just 4 techs over a 12 hour period. The phone never stops, the drive thru never stops the people never stop coming up to the counter. You have to go pea?  Good luck"
bad,"Not a good company to work for"
bad,"Greedy company that doesn't care for its employees, not a good place to work. They treat you like a machine and not a human make you work without bathroom or food break."
bad,"During my 3 year tenure here, I was written up for being off by 5 minutes on a prescription promise time, getting a store test done late (because I don't have time to do it at work), and for being late due to construction spots on three different routes I tried to take to get there.  Managers here are awful for the most part, and will take the corporate's stringent rules over what's logical in most cases."
bad,"Management only seems concerned with how fast a pharmacist can work. Putting patients on a path to better health is simple a slogan. If you are a CVS pharmacist and suffer from a medical condition, good luck! CVS also is in no way concerned with abiding by MN’s state mandated lunch break policy for pharmacists working 6 hr shifts or longer being allowed to take an uninterrupted 30 minute lunch break. They get away with this (with the MN Board of Pharmacy looking the other way) by simply having a written policy in place; which the corporation has no intention of honoring. CVS also has no real intention of trying to meet their customer’s needs. They just continue to cut tech hours and make excuses; meanwhile their customers suffer. It reminds me of that kid in that movie “The Christmas Story” when he realizes “it’s just a crummy commercial."
bad,Laws and regulations as well as company policies are only  guidelines enforced when upper management needs to validate a Pharmacist termination. No concern for Pharmacist -Technician Ratio (or Certified Technicians) and not enough support help to comply wish Patient counseling laws. Toxic for pharmacists who value performing their job as taught in school. Be prepared to multitask like you never have seen before. Very exhausting and very little PROFESSIONAL SATISFACTION.
bad,The most weird place I've ever worked.  As a new hire I was making $3 more than employees that had been there for years. The employees begged me not to mention that they asked about my pay because they can be punished for asking. No one in the office speaks to each other because emails go out specifically stating not to do so. My manager was rarely available.  The company only issues 30 min lunches for all employees. The assignment are not clearly explained. I was trained by one lead and others would help me when they could on assignments that I hadn't been trained to do.  Literally 9/10 current employees warned me to find another job because they don't approve of the company or higher management.
bad,"A typical day starts before the pharmacy opens for most pharmacists and can easily extend to after hours.  Due to the constant cutting technician hours and an increase in responsibilities, there is never enough time/resources to finish daily responsibilities.  Due to the lack or lowering of hours, technician turnover is increasing.  And the process to hire and train a new employee is very long, so very hard to get new employees into the store."
bad,CVS does not care about their employees. They think we have no value and easy to replace.  We have to work very hard and they always pushing more work on you.
bad,"This company has very little value for its employees. Technician hours are cut drastically leaving the pharmacy short staffed and employees overworked. It is a metrics and numbers driven business, rather than a setting designed to provide quality healthcare. Upper management could care less how the work gets done, as long as its being done. You will be burned out, under appreciated, and stressed in this working environment."
bad,I was constantly harrassed by a coworker to the point I dreaded going to work. Catty environment also. One pharmacist said I could go home early because there wasn't anthing to do. I was written up for that.
bad,Love to work with a good team and good management. I don' t like it that everyone is not on the same page especially if you are new to the location even when you have worked with CVS for a long time. The seniority will leave you out and not explained things to you about that long history of them and the customers. It makes me feel dumb and out of place but I do what I can and follow the training that I have been taught so if they have issues they can solve it themselves. What I also notice is that they hate training new employees how to run their system and how to navigate so the job can be shared through out.
bad,"I really enjoyed the management team I worked with as a cashier. They pay was decent, and I made several friends who were great references later on. This was a good part-time job while I was in college, but I would not recommend it to anyone. I don't appreciate the way corporate runs things, they don't consider the ones who work tireless hours to keep their company going. When I worked there, corporate would make infrequent visits to the individual stores, telling anyone and  everyone what we were doing wrong. They would fail to praise the accomplishments we had made, or ask what they themselves improve on. Also, terminations were frequent. In the two years I worked there, five girls were fired without warning by people outside of our store. Some for simple things like using a coupon wrong, there was no warnings and our actual boss usually had no say in the matter, it was seriously ridiculous. One of the women had worked there ten years and was fired in front of everyone at the end of her shift because they had no one to cover for her. If you're looking for a company who overall cares about and appreciates their workers, I would not suggest working at CVS."
bad,I discovered that I never want to work in a retail pharmacy again. The facility was new but we often had problems with the bathrooms. They do provide training but it is incredibly disorganized and hit or miss.
bad,"Working for CVS-Omnicare was just plain horrible. No clear communication within the company let alone with the homes serviced by the company. Depending on which department you work in you may work as few as 32ish hours a week to over 50 hours a week, and management wouldn't blink an eye at telling you that its mandatory. If you work in a department where you answer phones your expected to keep a professional demeanor but the nurses and homes you speak with can get away with talking to you like your a dog yet half of them can't even do basic math. Due to loss of business I was actually called while on maternity leave and told that I wouldn't have a job to return to because they lost business and my position is being terminated. You get under paid, they cut benefits to basically nothing; I mean you work for a pharmacy but have no pharmacy benefits, management walks all over employees, and there is really no balance between work and home life. No one should have to choose between going home to have dinner with their family and working."
bad,Skeleton staffing and too many time-consuming tasks tied to unachievable metrics breed poor morale. I find it unacceptable that it is expected the professional staff must work without pay to make sure our customers' needs are met and to attend to conference calls and training after hours.
bad,"One of the most controlling, unstructured & unprofessional places to work at. The verbal abuse & disrespect from customers & coworkers was unfathomble."
bad,Stay away from this place completely the management is terrible upper management doesn’t know how to run a warehouse at all they do not take criticism well. And also they never can hold enough employees to keep you at overtime or consistently lie and try to trick you into believing that you will work just 40 hours a week when you will not work 40 hours a week and in stores without adding people it’s a terrible culture management doesn’t care about you they do no work whatsoever. If you walk in at 6 o’clock in one second later you’ll get a half a point every time if you’re one second late from lunch or any break you will get a half a point and they will point you even if you need to be out sick with a doctors note
bad,"Endless promises of hours yet none ever given "
bad,Management is a joke.  They are a terribly run company.  It is no wonder they are in the top 12 WORST places to work.  Never felt more mistreated in my professional career.  So much that I left the profession.
bad,"It's an Okay company, You work most holidays and cannot really take time off. They take a long time to get the payment settled. The company is just unorganized."
bad,"They dont care about their employees, its about money, not people. They do not value employee opinion or hard work. Willing to lose great staff to save a buck."
bad,If you are desperate work here if you have other options follow them. Never ever allow a manager to grab or touch you at any job it is called assault but at CVS the victim gets fired
bad,it is a very fast paced company. you will be told on your first day that if you think you won't be able to handle this job then you need to leave now. you are all replaceable.
bad,"I really enjoyed working at CVS for the most part. Scheduling became a bit of a problem towards to end of my employment. The atmosphere overall was very tense and unhappy, resulting in an unhealthy work environment."
bad,"Coram CVS Health needs better working systems to keep up with the overwhelming health care demands, especially with all of the expectations of management.  Employees just aren't able to be efficient in their jobs and the customer/patient suffers. Management should consider hiring more staff for extremely overworked employees simply because the work flow has doubled or tripled and not base hiring new employees only because of the branch size....makes no sense and patients do suffer...due to errors from overworked staff. Management is not great. Too much dictating and not enough ACTIVE LISTENING to the ideas of employees that actually do the job daily."
bad,"I have never worked at a place where diligence and excellence are more unappreciated.  If you are good at ""working the system"" and manipulating people, you will probably do well for yourself here at the expense of your co-workers.  If you are Innovative, Collaborative, Caring, Accountable, and committed to your Integrity, you will get trampled on.  The ""Core Values"" that CVS Specialty Monroeville management parrots lip-service to are a joke; the exact opposite of what I experienced here.  If you are the type of person who gives 100% in everything you do, you will be chewed up and spit out.  "
bad,Working for cvs and trying to have a social life is a little complicated. but overall cvs is a good place to make extra money if you are a college student.
bad,You start off as a Selector. You are on a timed system. The time is constantly manipulated so it gets difficult to maintain your weekly average. Management is very shady. Lots of nepotism in that facility. I wouldnt recommend that place to an enemy!
bad,Too many managers and none of them communicated with each other. No one was on the same page and we were told different things by the hour. The job itself is not difficult.
bad,Cvs health is interested in one thing and that’s the bottom line.  Cvs reported $181.4 billion in revenues last year.  Cvs payed employees $10 billion in wages and $1 billion in benefits.  Cvs’s  charitable donations last year where only 100 million.  Low pay and understaffing are a constant problem for every cvs location.  Members of management are expected to be on call during all operationing hours.
bad,"This company will hire for one position then demand that you work far away from your home, then cut your pay and hours. Terrible culture.Management is unsupportive- work/life balance is non-existent."
bad,"Since we worked as a team, we gave support to each other when we felt as if they need help to achieve the store's goal. It was like a family working together, because we care for one another."
bad,The amount of work forced onto people is too high.  People don't feel like they can take any time off due to the amount of work and inability to have people cover while they are out.
bad,This company treats it's employees horrible and doesn't care one bit about them. They don't know how to run a pharmacy or take care of their customers. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work here.
bad,prejudiced and horrible abusive false organization fire American after doing a heritage background with discriminatory racial profiling and horrible invasive and violation of privacy.
bad,"Great that they help with obtaining licensing however I started part time and had to quit, overworked and underpaid. Crazy hours and non understanding managment"
bad,"The position was great at first. During training you are not allowed to miss any days except for emergencies.  Learning materials were inconsistent with what we were taught, trainers had a ""I know more than you about this job so that means I have all the answers and you better pay attention"" attitude. They would talk bad about  trainees during training class  and ""warn their supervisors before they hit the floor making them look bad in front of their superiors. They lie to you about promotions and career advantages, low moral,  favortism,  control, they are constantly watching and looking over your shoulder for potential mistakes, if you are hard up for money then go for it, if not run, dont just walk away, the experience will scar you for life if you let it They will fire you when open enrollment is over then they will not need you. Users and abusers!"
bad,"I hated this job. My manager treated me like I was an idiot and only promoted me to supervisor because nobody else wanted the job and were all quitting. Most everyone is given either too much work to do and not enough time or given tasks without being trained sufficiently to do said tasks ahead of time. Raises are at the very minimum with employee reviews being so strict that it is nearly impossible to get good scores unless your manager plays favorites. I felt completely underappreciated and not a part of any team. The only positive thing I can say is that I was able to acquire additional training for the pharmacy which gave me more experience and job flexibility, and also allowed me to leave this company in order to get a better job."
bad,"Company policy and practices do not support their mission statement due to the company's business model. CVS's business model requires it patient's to use their services,therefore,customer service/care is not a necessity. Overworked,over-stressed teams work tirelessly to achieve unattainable goals."
bad,I think cvs is a bad company to work for!! Managers don't listen.  I bent over backwards to help out and never really recognize for it.  Hr is the absolute worst!  Not very accommodating to there employees at all!! I worked many crazy hours.  They expect you to devote your life to them and nor very concerned about you're home life. Like if your kids are sick or you are sick. Have to come in anyway.
bad,A typical day at work is frustrating and I am usually feeling as though we desperately need a store meeting but that never happens. Everyone has their own way of doing things and we don't function very well as a team. I feel as though cvs corporate cares very little about the employee or the customer.
bad,Don't work here. I feel that I was able to move forward in my career but at a cost that nobody should endure. The stress is unbearable and schedule is unfair. You work too hard and you don't reap the benefits.
bad,"As a pharmacy technician, you are in teams of 100+ with no room for advancement. Promotions come up VERY rarely and most of the time a candidate is hand chosen by management and asked personally to apply (as I was). Not a good way to foster talent. Mandatory overtime is required on a regular basis as scheduling and workflow is very poorly managed. There is NO reward for going above and beyond the basic job requirements. Pay raises are annual and paltry at best (3%). Company loves to advertise that they give quarterly bonuses, but these amount to maybe 4 hours of compensation at best. You will be more highly and diversely trained than your superiors, though this will not help you to advance."
bad,"CVS as a company is very shrewd and knows how to leverage money and invest. That said, they have no idea how to treat their employees, the face and backbone of their business. I currently work in the pharmacy and it is without question the worst job I've ever had. Constant, unrealistic metrics, deplorable work conditions, and being understaffed are common pitfalls in most CVS stores. Turnover rate is high because employees become frustrated from lack of support from management and constantly being made to work much harder than necessary rather than smarter. You may notice on job boards and job sites that there seem to be many positions available for employment with CVS, but that is because workers are getting fed up and are quitting by the droves. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this company."
bad,"My interview was a sham. They mentioned nothing about it being an ""open shift"" which means you may or may not get 8 hours a day. It all depends on how long it takes to get all the orders completed. Also, I was told the job was to be an order picker, BUT they expected me to stack full totes on pallets 8 high (some could weigh 50+ lbs) even though I have 2 herniated discs in my back. The only way I could get out of the assignment was to bring a doctor's note to them. The front door should be replaced by one that revolves. The turnover is unbelievable and if CVS really cared about people, they would fully disclose some of their expectations to potential employees. Of course, if they did this... nobody would be likely to want to work there."
bad,"When you interview for CVS/Caremark, they tout a lot of possible promotions and lots of movement in the company itself. It sounds nice, but once you start working there you realize that there are few if any opportunities for movement. Even when other positions or departments open up, it's all about who you know and who you've cozied up to in the management rather than actual ability. This leads to a lot of incompetence in the upper echelons, as well as very skilled people stuck at the bottom of the ladder and very dissatisfied with the experience working there and it causes them to eventually move on to better things."
bad,"THE pay is terrible, the leads and supervisor are cut-throat, lie and cheat their way through a day of work, there is no cross training, the same people do the easy jobs while the other people get assigned the hard jobs all the time, to many family members of upper management standing around watching other people work and getting paid more."
bad,"Employees are not valued.   Not a healthy place to work,  Moral among team members is very low.  The way the company rates goals and accomplishments are too numbers based which does not reflect an accurate picture."
bad,"Cvs is a cut throat place to work, part time is okay but not paid well for it and expected to do lots of work on minimal staffing. Management knows of problems and does not care"
bad,"Management does not deliver support and has no clue what the employees go through everyday. Goals are set that are impossible to meet. Overworked, overwhelmed, and stressed out is how I spend my time at work."
bad,"I have worked with over 10+ managers over a span of 17 years, and only 2 of those managers were hard working and appreciated their staff.  All other management was lazy, collected undeserved bonuses, and treated their employees very poorly.  CVS can be a great place to work; it all depends on the store management."
bad,"Although I loved what I did, dealing with poor management and constant change in work hours.  There is a high turnover and never ending change in expectation of work.  You will be responsible for constantly having to cover other positions and will be required to work extra hours.  "
bad,"As a pharmacy technician at CVS you are put in a highly stressful position of constantly having to do the work of more than one person. The customers are always angry at you due to the cost of their medication and the fact that many of them do not feel well. There are also many customers trying to run scams to get medication they aren't supposed to have."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the comaraderie. I will miss the incredibly loyal people I worked with.  CVS management has to understand you cannot expect a pharmaceutical company to function like a retail store."
bad,Once again I do not want to write these stupid reviews because I am just trying to find a new job and I don't care about the other jobs I once had.... work here if u want
bad,"poor management structure.  Not a pleasant work environment.  Helping customers was the only good part of the job.  I learned about compounding, and health insurance claims"
bad,"Hours get cut in pharmacies all the time, but they would cut us down to near nothing. I worked 12 hour shifts by myself in the pharmacy with phone calls, patients walking up, e-scribes rolling in, emails and other notifications to check and prescriptions to be filled. All by myself for 12 hours."
bad,"Hostile work environment.  "
bad,Not really fond of this company obviously. If you are a pharmacy tech in general unless you are the lead they do not know how to talk to you correctly. The pay is not enough for the stress.
bad,"CVS only allows about 210 hours a week per store, at least that's how it was at my store. I was never given more than 36 hours a week to work and I was in management. You are expected to do the work of every other title other than your own. By the time you are finished with that work, your own work has not been finished. Management is terrible. They are stressed and very unprofessional. They use profanity towards employees and in front of customers. There is only ever one cashier and one floating cashier. The floating cashier is usually stocking the store or breaking down merchandise. The floating cashier may be another cashier or a member of management. HR does not take calls or emails seriously and are very rude. They talk big of promotions but do not like to give raises. You will find yourself doing the job of 4 different positions for little pay and little reward. Since everyone understands the company they are unmotivated and do the bare minimum. This leads to a terrible looking store and terrible customer service."
bad,One of the hardest places to work when it comes to having a Work-Life balance. Management does not care about employees.  It is very cut throat. Salary based pay for 40 hours per week but you work up to 60 hours a week (20 hours unpaid) just to finish daily duties. Understaffed and very stressful environment
bad,"Although I loved my actual job, I was very disheartened about how this company is managed.  I can see why some of the customers were frustrated with the services they received."
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work at Omnicare/CVS due to under-staffing and poor management.  I enjoyed my job very much, but just felt ill-prepared to tackle everything."
bad,"Stressful, demeaning, negative, ""daycare"" like."
bad,"Manager did not have a grasp on how to be professional in the work place and when under pressure, she would take her anger out on employees as well as vendors."
bad,The culture at CVS/Caremark call center was difficult to deal with. The hardest part of the job was coming in every weekend to do payroll. The most enjoyable were the events that they held.
bad,I always did my work plus the work of any boys who would never do theirs. management was fine until they felt you crossed them in some kind of way. I did not like anything about this job really.
bad,I worked for CVS for a month and a half. The pay is not worth what they expect you to do and the 1st shift DPS supervisor had a I don't care attitude.
bad,"Benefits extremely expensive making my salary more like $10 a hour. Greedy corporation. Company made $84 billion dollars last year, and they still increased cost of benefits and cut services. Managers micro-manage all day long Work culture is non stop. If you stop suddenly, they immediately come over and ask what is going on.. Hardest part of job is that the medications are extremely expensive and any error could cost the company a lot of money or jeopardize a persons health. Most enjoyable was the ability to help people."
bad,Other techs constantly calling out...super stressful doing all the tasks yourself...the pharmacist it legit running around like a chicken with no head..very unsafe...mistakes can happen
bad,Don't do it...unless you like not being appreciated and worked in unsafe conditions with high expectations of achieving unrealistic goals and targets.  They do not value people and that is why they lose good pharmacists who care.
bad,Poor management horrible company bad supervisor worked for ten years and never received the pay i earned doing everyones job and the pharmacist job then
bad,"I worked in the mail order facility. Only open 8-6 monday-friday, no holidays, no weekends. Still asked to transferred after a year. Most hostile job environment I have ever experienced. No schedule is worth the toxicity that existed there. I asked to float and to have only closing shifts, a scheduler's dream. After 1 month they placed me permanently in a store that no one else would take, without asking me.  I was there 3 months and we were robbed 5 times. I found employment elsewhere."
bad,"typical day at work would be stocking and cashiering"
bad,"Had many red flags during initial interview, but took the job anyway. They are understaffed due to ridiculous on-call shifts. Lots of turnover and poor management all the way up the ladder."
bad,Culture is hard wired to be competitive and the department I worked in was very cut throat.  The back stabbing culture has not changed since I left and hard to trust management nor colleagues.
bad,Expect to work the work of 2-3 people at all times. You then get paid well under the national average even if you are nationally certified. Hours week to week can vary and some weeks you can hardly get 30 hours at fulltime. The expectations that corporate holds are rarely obtainable and the things they focus on actually require you to take attention from the customers right in front of you.
bad,"Since the buyout by CVS, this company has gone downhill.  There is a large turnover of staff and corporate doesn't seem to notice or care.  Lack of proper training throughout the pharmacy is a huge problem.  Medications are not processed properly or in a timely manner, therefore, their contracts are not happy.  You can ask the same question to any number of management staff and get a different answer from each one.  Some managers have the idea that staff should just figure things out themselves and give no direction whatsoever.  Pay is poor and the health insurance is a catastrophic plan only.  There is no sense of job security as CVS is implementing many changes. This company has zero respect or regard for their employees."
bad,"Most unorganized workplace to work in. There is no cutoff time for compounding orders, so a closing schedule is 8:30 and you clock out 10-11pm. To many outside sources control the facility."
bad,"I have not had a great experience here. I've stuck it out and worked hard. I love the job, but the management and corporation in whole are a huge disappointment. They intentionally keep you off-balance with scheduling. We've lost 9 people in a year and a half, I don't need to say anything else about it."
bad,"I HATED working for CVS. They pinch pennies and do NOT take care of their employees or customers. Mainly high stress, no breaks, its easy to get behind during the day but its inevitable because they barely give training before they throw you out to the sharks. You also rarely will ever get a salary raise (back to CVS pinching pennies). It sucks for employees here."
bad,"If you like to get verbally abused 98 % of the day this job is for you. When needing help the supervisors are either at a lunch in or flirting with other supervisors. Even though this is a fortune 500 company with good intentions, in order to advance you must know someone personally to get you in or they will find some reason not to promote you. They time you in getting bathroom breaks, giving you 10 minutes. If you go over you get wrote up. If you have a mental condition they treat you very unprofessionally. The only good thing is about this job is sitting while getting paid but that also takes a toll on your body since your inactive for the most part. In conclusion unless you are desperate for a job do not work here, look somewhere else."
bad,Since CVS has taken over Target it has all gone downhill. We are lacking staff and hours. Cant even go to other stores to make up hours because no one has hours to give.
bad,"Don't do it. Sucks here.  Work long hours, they play favorites. Management sucks. Did I say that management sucks? No one has a clue in management. Don't work here."
bad,It's ok if you need money.  Very easy job to do.  I live what I do.  The management just isn't fair.  They show favoritism and don't listen to lower level employees.
bad,You will never know what time you get out they will always change the rules. Lots of people will tell you to watch your self around management. Their very big about diversity and they start firing people around February an March
bad,The staff was typically older people who were stuck working there the rest of their lives.  With that being said they were always mad about something and always had attitudes.  They were all childish and filled with negativity.
bad,"This company has rightfully earned its place on the top 10 worst companies to work for - currently ranked #7. "
bad,"I've never worked in such chaos in all my life.  The place is too small, stock all over the place, can't easily locate merchandise, not enough staff. Very stressful environment."
bad,I had a terrible experience here. I was constantly overworked and was payed the same amount as when I was 16 years old. Spending time helping people is what I do and this company forced me to not care about that.
bad,My typical day consisted of the process of filling prescriptions as well as supervising other employees. I learned the the corporate aspect of the company doesn't care about the customers they serve or their employees. Management wasn't held to typical or proper procedures. My co-workers were hard working. The hardest part of my job was providing the best customer service given the procedures the company wanted me to follow. The best part of my job was me leaving.
bad,"needs improvement treating empolyees, paid unfairly, excepted more than time given. There  are no chance for advancements unless knowing someone in company."
bad,"but they're not. no on the job training, you are expected to know your job within 2 weeks which is impossible. The RPh's need to work together in a coherent fashion. Management is incompetent, no one who knows anything is running the ship.  If you complain about management, there is retaliation.  Workload is too large for amount of people working. Job description is always changing.  They need to get it together before everyone quits."
bad,"No breaks, overworked and under appreciated. Poor management, a lot of favoritism. They're not flexible with scheduling and your forced to work holidays. I would not recommend that anyone work for this company"
bad,"I was hired by CVS to be a distribution clerk, The people that contacted me e-mailed me the wrong information right off. I was scheduled to start on a Monday at 7:45, I showed up at 7:30 and NO ONE was aware I was supposed to start. I waited 45 mins for someone to show up so I could get access into the building. After a day of paperwork, Having it drilled into us that mistakes ARE NOT tolerated, Speaking to anyone while in the workplace is not allowed And being even a minute late is grounds for a written warning, We were taken to the floor so one of the workers could show us what to do. We were forced to stay an hour late on or 1st day, And not paid overtime since we were not to clock in our 1st week as they had already submitted our 40 hours for the week to payroll... Needless to say, My 1st day, WAS MY LAST....."
bad,"The review title about sums it up. Fast paced, under staffed, low pay. CVS was a company where you distinctly got the feeling that you were being milked for every last ounce of work you could be, while being compensated as little as possible. Extremely stressful, myself along with ALL of the other techs and Pharmacists I worked with have all moved on from the company citing the extreme amounts of stress."
bad,A typical day is stressful. We usually do not have enough help to get everything finished on time. I enjoy working with all my co-workers.
bad,"typical work day"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers and dealing with multiple cultures. I got an opportunity to be immersed in Spanish and learned how crucial it is for the customers to feel inclusion.
bad,"Worked as a Pharmacy Tech for 2 years.  Pharmacy was incredibly busy, and we never had enough techs to handle the workload (drive thru!!) Upper management kept cutting hours, manager was uncommunicative. Customers for the most part were nice. Left to work for a competitor  - so much better."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid and understaffed! This company is constantly changing management and processes knowing that we get busy every new year until about June but do little or nothing to be prepared but how can a person be prepared when they are changing constantly."
bad,"Con job.  "
bad,data entry is setting for 8 hrs you and the computer only just typing away scripts. co workers are nice. if you are late more than 5 min you get written up. low pay
bad,no direction. pay is horrible. i would totally quit if i didn't need the money! its too much work & not enough pay! you deal with a lot of stress & they don't compensate enough.
bad,"I've never seen upper management be so toxic and give new meaning to the words Micro-manage.  When they brought in this new set of upper management, they must not have looked at the skill sets because it is now being run like a call center.  We had to live via the emails a lot and it something wasn't answered in about 5 minutes, we were getting asked why.  Um...cause you have us doing all this other stuff -- oh yea, you must have forgotten about all those assignments.  "
bad,"I worked there for 8yrs and last 2yrs that distribution center went down. The director blames everyone else if her ""new ideas"" fail. She talkes down to ppl. She has to like you and you have to always agree with her and be willing to do as she says or she will demote or fire you on the spot. Her daughter in law a supervisor there does what she wants as well. If the director and daughter in law doesn't like you then they will make a way to fire you or make you quit. You never know what time you are getting off. If machines break down and you don't make rate it's still your fault for not making rate. I only recommend this job if your single or in desperate need of a job. Oh and HR is not on your side either."
bad,I was hired due to relevant experience i had. but the store was way worse than they let on. there was never enough hours on the schedule to properly staff the store. Leaving what should be a standard retail job and making it into a headache and stress machine!
bad,"The local store level did its best to care for its employees, but it is very obvious this company could not care less on a corporate stand point.  You are meat to be ground till they have no use for you."
bad,"Upper management was not up front with the acquisition of the company and kept communication to a minimum. Completed all requirements they asked and still laid off 120 people,"
bad,"Terrible management, they show extreme favoritism. If you are not the pet, they will not like you. I do not recommend anyone to work here!"
bad,"Working with the management that i worked with was a nightmare, the employees are what made the days go by faster along with engaging the customers but the supervisors made you feel like quitting i will never work at another cvs again in my life. Just the thought of shopping at cvs disgusts me"
bad,you work 8 to 10 hours a day. Found out some stuff I didn't know about pharmaceuticals. Needs new local management. I've met some good coworkers and some lazy coworkers.
bad,"I have worked with this company for a little over a year and there hasn't been a month that went by that they weren't cutting hours for one reason or another. This week for example I only got FOUR hours!! I am fortunate to have a good supervisor at THIS store but I came from other stores and they were rude, phony or unprofessional.  I wouldn't really recommend this company based on those cirucumstances sorry."
bad,"this company did not in away take care of their employees. i rarely every saw my supervisor, i did work late night shifts but when i would try to contact him he would never answer me calls or texts unless he needed me to so something for him. this company is always losin employees. while i worked there they went through 2 PICs an HR manager and about 12 employees within a year"
bad,"Even with previous pharmacy background, you will be lost in the sea of Omnicare.  Once hired staff usually, with help of management spend the day putting out fires.  No one can complete a work assignment because of constantly being moved to a different area to put out a fire.  New people are not trained.  They are just thrown in the mix and expected to perform like someone who has work for a year.  The culture there is your a body, do this, now do that, now do this.  Yet, they will not show you how to do anything, or explain anything.  They want no talking, fast work, and be willing to live at the place if the need arises.  Which is everyday, since it's so mismanaged nothing get done on time.  Then when the dust settles down, they will have a meeting about all the mistakes made.  Long hours, no communication, management just makes appearances to put out fires and ramrod the crew to where the nearest fire is burning.  Total disrespect for new people.  A new person will be on their own to learn what they can, and if your lucky someone might answer a question, which totally depends on their mood.  Low morale, long hours when mandated.  Crazy start times, for most everyone.  They don't even tell the new hires they get two breaks or a lunch.  Keep them working until they figure it out.  Turn over is high, and the stress is higher.  Don't work for them unless you absolutely need a paycheck.  Oh, and did I mention the standing all day, bad lighting and crazy cold conditions.  But they do have free coffee, and provide plates, silverware, water, etc., provided you have figured out you"
bad,Worst job ever!! Stay away!!! I wish I read these reviews before I decided to accept this job. The reviews are accurate and true. There is no point in repeating all the negative comments so I would suggest you read them and see for yourself.  The weird part about the reviews is that it shows how Omnicare is in various states throughout the country. One would think it would be limited to that state but NO!! these experiences are the same no matter what state one works in.  Do temp work if you must! This company is in trouble and most employees are looking for work elsewhere. If they are not they have their heads in the sand!
bad,Everything is about numbers. You are not adequately compensated for the work done. They can not be pleased. Everything is suppose to be about the customer but they don't make the effort to improve work conditions to allow for better customer service.
bad,"If you don't have a job, ok this will work.  If you have a job stay where you are.  Example, I had one employee who had over 10,000 unread email.  Yes I wrote ten-thousand.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire 25 year career.  It's text book crisis management."
bad,"I have worked at 3 separate CVS stores and every employee at every store hates their job. In short they are understaffed, underpaid, and overworked. unrealistic goals are set in an effort to squeeze every ounce of energy and potential from every employee. because of this they have an extremely high turnover rate. few people last more than a year in either the pharmacy or front store. I am a licensed tech. I personally pay to keep my license current and only make $9.00/hr. I was promised a pay raise after 2 months but the district manager conveniently forgot about that promise. I have a job that requires a license and knowledge about insurance and medicine, but don't make much more than a person who folds shirts at American Eagle."
bad,it's a very busy store at high volume of scripts a day. there is not enough staff there. most difficult party of the job can be billing some of the customers insurance.
bad,"This is an awful company to work for. All kinds of drama, all one sided, and management does not care they let it continue. It is a very harrassing, hostile work environment and if you want to advance with Omnicare do not work here cause they only let their favorites move up. Looking for another job. No work/family life balance, hours keep changing, and procedures change daily. RUN, RUN, RUN from this place. You have been warned."
bad,It is large national company with a poor customer service and customer satisfaction review
bad,"CVS has a lot to learn when it comes to employee relations, in my 8 years with the company I have felt taken advantage of as well as unappreciated. The company does not pay its employees well. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Interact with customers thru the drive-thru or inside the store.  Place filled scripts into correct bins.  Scan in products from warehouse and McKesson. Place inventory on shelves.  Fill new and current scripts.  Enter new scripts from dive-thru or drop-off area.  Contact insurance companies when needed.
bad,Constant turn-over. Reason so many job listings for CVS. No long term security. Management difficult. HR non existing.
bad,"I worked in the St. Louis location and it was a nightmare. Constantly wanting you to key orders faster and more and more but would pull you to do other jobs.  Then they complained about errors. it's a revolving door as far as employees go and they are always short handed... ALWAYS.  I was there a year and they were never fully staffed.  Training is horrible, it is basically on the job and do it yourself.  No advancement offered and favoritism when it comes to applying and getting other jobs with in the company.  Pay raises are a joke and pay in general is a joke you will make the same with or with out experience.  If you have worked in a pharmacy for 20 years you will make the same amount as Joe blow off the street with no license or experience."
bad,"Continued to learn and educate with training with unfulfilled promises of advancements. Had to continuously prove myself, just one more time to get the promotion."
bad,they make it sound like a great place to work...it is NOT...it's horrible and you have no job security..there is no consistency with anything...run far away from this company
bad,This was an office that I went to because I am now in school to obtain a degree in Health Care Administration. Thinking this could be a way for me to start in my field I excepted the job. This doctors office was a cashed based office as well as Medicare and Peoples Health. The patients that had appointments with insurance they made them wait all day. They took patients that did not have insurance who were cash paying patient and did not have appointmentst. The person that was running the office the manager would charge patients extra money to get in and out. The hardest part of my job was watching what was happen to the elderly patients that came in the office and waited all day. sometimes not getting seen because the doctor would leave. I did enjoy meeting new people and learning new process related to my field of study.
bad,"I have over 15 years of experience yet I was treated as though this was my first pharmacy job. Management is awful, favoritism is the norm....we had no human resources rep so they pretty much did whatever they wanted. There was never enough help to get the orders out, they were hemmoraging business, the more accounts they lost the worse the staff was treated....place was an absolute nightmare"
bad,"I was employed as a Billing/Customer Service Representative in the Allentown, PA Central Billing Center. It was constant stress. Huge volumes of work with unreasonable deadlines. The Billing Center is a revolving door of employees. They put the word multi-task to shame, needing to do 3 or 4 things all at the same time otherwise no one could keep up. Many do not, who can? What is a shame is the lack of good management who looks upon any employee as so very indispensable, there is a forever new hires training class. Very difficult to advance, depends on who you make friends with or to whom you are related."
bad,"This company tends to pull people from drug stores like cvs and Walgreens with little to no experience in long term health care. You're trained for maybe a day or two and have no real ""leader"" to turn to when faced with difficult situations. The management is horrible in the front office and they aren't even taken seriously by their bottom feeder employees. They're constantly under employed and basically work their workers to death. But don't go over 40 hours or you'll be in trouble with the regional manager!  Just do work 90x faster! It's kinda sad how disrespected the management is. But clearly the employees know more about whats going on than the top guy. Nurses get horrible customer service and are often transferred 4-6 times before someone can help.  When calling the raleigh location it is obvious these people aren't happy and don't actually care about their patients. Unhappy workers = not a good business. I hope they realize they it's the employees that keep a business alive before it is too late. Oh and new management never hurt a business...however if you have no higher education and have a pharmacy experience, it's a job which is hard to come by these days. Just be prepared..."
bad,"I worked here from Savon to Albertsons to now CVS, it is horrible environment, it would be ideal but the way the management works it makes it harder on the worker. They expect more done with less pay."
bad,"Company promotes only from outside, District mangers are unhelpful and generally unaware of the day to day operations of the stores they supervise. Recognition is non existent and you never hear from supervisors unless you are being scolded for not hitting a metric that makes them look bad. No feedback, No development just scoldings and threats as though you are completely replaceable and they will make sure you know it."
bad,"There expectation of what needs to be done in a day are unrealistic. They have consistently taken away support person hours, they have taken away pharmacist hours to such an extent that you can no longer effectively help the patients. The bottom line is all that is important.. They treat employees with no respect. I am disappointed with myself for not leaving the company sooner. I would not recommend CVS to a fellow pharmacist"
bad,"I worked at cvs for 13 years as a lead pharmacy technician,I hate it they don't care about their employees at all ,I so happy now working in a pharmacy tthat I get 4 bonus through the year and a piece of mind,"
bad,clean and stock shelves i learned never to work in a place like that again.management kept changing.most of my co workerswhere always late or called in sick.if you where a drinking partner of management there where no consiquences
bad,CVS does not have many hours for part time staff. This could have also been because of the fact that I was a full-time high school student. The pay is about minimum wage but the work is not that hard.
bad,"You basically will be reviewing rejected claims for resolution whether that be for prior authorization, suggesting an alternative or performing a quick fix to the online claim. The problem being that you are reacting to claims submitted by the pharmacies in which 80-90% of the billers have little experience with pharmacy billing. For example, you will see a lot of rejected claims for Advair being submitted for a 2 day supply. Sounds easy but when you see them in the volume that occurs and when you have legitimate claims to review, it gets quite old. There is no mechanism of accountability for these folks."
bad,"bad company, expectations can not be met, management does not"
bad,"Poor management, they overworked their employees and don't even care about workplace culture. And no one knows who's in charge in any position or operation."
bad,"Just save yourself the hassle and keep looking for a different job... CVS has NO appreciation for their employees. Average pay, for A LOT of work if you’re in the management position. Store Managers don’t communicate with you about availability and when they do, they disregard it and schedule you anyway. They don’t care about their employees like they claim. They’ll promise you a bunch and give you nothing"
bad,I am frustrated because when I do a really good job my store manager still finds a way to yell at me and makes me feel worthless. Just an all around bad experiance for me.
bad,The store I was hired to work at cannot keep employees due the extreme stress and unrealistic expectations that all staff is placed under. There was never adequate staffing to take care of the patients.
bad,"Corporate sets excessive expectations for what is possible for one pharmacy. Technicians are grossly underpaid and corporate refuses to increase their hourly rate thus the talent of the technicians is lacking. They consistently cut technician and pharmacist hours leading to a culture of ""do more with less"" all so they can maximize shareholder value."
bad,Poorly structured company. Managment was unprofessional and did not create a great environment for pharm techs to succeed in. One boss exhibited very unethical behavior was a simply moved to another location instead of being fired.
bad,It is hard to attain goals based on expectations. This is a very simplified system where it's hard to maintain clinical knowledge. My management does not support me and only cares about on paper results. I am working 10-15 hours unpaid.
bad,"The ENGINEERING at CVS in Patterson, Ca. Is all bad. That is why downtime will be the only way you will make your %. One more thing if you feel that someone is messing with %. Management is , W.M.S. Warehouse MANAGEMENT System. The most enjoyable part about working there was when it was Long Drugs. Sorry I am just being honest."
bad,That the district manager is a liar l! He always said he wants to help but when they did go to him for help he didn’t help at all! Team leader right! No! I’ve seen what he does with my own eyes! Should seriously have the ceo go undercover and see what happens! Then the manager leveled someone up and he expressed that he was going through a lot so the manager said this employee could go home and have the rest of the night off! That employee was his car when the manager called the cops on this employee! Then the next day he got fired because the manager called the cops! Seriously!
bad,"I was a cashier wanting to move up so I went for pharmacy tech trainee. They promised to help me become certified, hand me books, give me classes, teach me. Nothing came true I became a forgotten project quick! and contacting anyone who would help me was a joke from the pharmacy Trainor never answering phone for months and constant managers leaving. This place is a joke"
bad,"The expectations vs the tools we are given are on the opposite end of the spectrum. They consistently cut hours but expect more. There are very few decent applicants that are willing to deal with it so there aren't much staff, not that there are hours to give anyway. Its all about corporate greed."
bad,Job started out okay... summer hours were AMAZING. Even the hours received during school. It just gets tiring at point. Where you start to dislike going to work. Due to the management MOSTLY. Overall it’s a good experience i guess go into the customer service lane. Really shows you the difficulties of what other retail employees have to deal with.
bad,Great to start then as you grew older cvs became very biased . They find any reason to get rid of you. I love cvs and proud of my accomplishment but management sucks
bad,"As a pharmacist, I would arrive to a job with a respectable work force of technicians who cared about their work and me. The problem with the job was the District Manager. I was taken out of a regular store and changed to a floater because another pharmacist wanted to be where I was. I had no real choice as to what days and hours I preferred, as I was expected to be at their beckon call. When the economy had a recession in 2008 I was pulled out of a store and accused of being impaired. The district office told me I had to place myself on Family Medical Leave and go to a treatment center or get terminated. While at the treatment center, all drug and alcohol tests were negative. When the center allowed me to return to work, CVS terminated me, and I was on Family Medical Leave at the time. I worked in a non-union state, but I learned that CVS has a bad relationship with the Teamsters Union in Illinois. I can't trust CVS."
bad,I worked there one year manager hardly ever there  never a pat on the back for anything  the most unappreciated place I have ever worked my last day manager said nothing to me
bad,"I worked for CVS for 6 years in 6 different positions as I went from cashier to Store Manager. There’s a lot of room for advancement and the pay is decent once you get to Assistant store manager but once you become salaried they really take advantage. I got paid for 45 hours but was consistently working 65+ because of call outs, cut hours, and management expectations. They constantly cut hours which makes it difficult to hire anyone full time."
bad,"Cvs is a horrible co.to work for.I am a former overnight Rph who worked there for 23 yrs.They work you to death with no help.They don’t care about their employees nor patients,only care about metrics, making money,et alia. They will find reasons to write you up and fire you if you have a higher salary due to seniority ."
bad,"Work until the job is done mentality, during big seasonal times that means 7 days a week and as many hours as it requires. As a (front) store manager you have 100 tasks to get done every day and will be held accountable to them but if the pharmacy pages for help you have to drop everything and help them no matter what, but that doesn’t act as justification as to why your tasks didn’t get done in the first place"
bad,I love the job and what they do. But management is the WORSE ‼️No flexible schedule. Management messy and does not treat everyone the same . Vacation sucks
bad,CVS has a huge management issues especially in communication. Team members don't communicate with each other causing drama and different issues at the store that affects revenue.
bad,Absolutely THE most horrible experience... save your time and go somewhere else!! Management doesn't care about employees and they are abusive! Would stay away.
bad,"Loved all the interactions with my customers, Corporate seemed unaware of how the days actually worked and put high demands,The work environment is where my main issues were."
bad,"Been with the company over a dozen years. It just gets worse and worse. Cutting tech hours puts stress on everyone on the team. Constantly feel like we're at least 1 person short. Basically set up to fail from the get go. Unrealistic expectations. If you have a choice of where to work, DO NOT CHOOSE CVS!"
bad,"You have to do Alot in little time. They expect you to get alot done and if you don't you better believe the next day you're going to get yelled at for it. But you also have to be a cashier,  help in the pharmacy,  put stock away, count drawers,  do deposit,  clean the backroom, clean the bathrooms and give the cashier her break or lunch."
bad,"Management lies every day. The warehouse is short staffed, but they give us unrealistic Goals, daily, as if we're fully staffed. Because we're short staffed, we can't reach those high goals which causes us to be in over time, Constantly. I started working at CVS in January and I finally left in October. I wanted to be there for a year but MONEY TALKS and working for a company that Cares about their employees is essential."
bad,The store I worked at was a mess. We had no pharmacy manager for months and only 1 staff pharmacist. Even the floater pharmacists hated coming to our store.
bad,"It was an okay job , there was nothing really to do in this position it was extremely boring you can’t do makeup, you just help people find beauty products and try to sell products that they didn’t want to buy especially the college kids they had no money to really spend."
bad,Siempre ponen a un cajero y un mananger en todo el turno ahy q limpiar y organizar toda l tienda sin descuidar la caja además de tomar fotos de pasaport colocad mercancía y cargar. Cajas todo en tiempo límite solo avanzas si le caes bien al mananger . Nunca tienen horas . Es una explotación haces más de 10 trabajos ahy y aún exigen más
bad,No communication among the management team on-site or with corporate. Discrimination by managers allowed. Managers allowed to play favorites. Management does not allow you to follow the policy's you are given during training.
bad,It was not a place to get properly trained to advance. The pharmacist makes you feel totally incompetent. You were talked to like you were stupid if you asked questions. I did not enjoy my time there.
bad,"If you are going to work at any cvs location study and obtain your p.t.c.b. or e.x.c.p.t test first, they hire new people off the street and overload them, then 6 months later they will fire you if you have not been certified. I was thank goodness. At certain times of the year you have mandatory overtime.. like January you have to have 10-15 hours each week. It is good for someone young who does not yet have children or a family to tend to."
bad,"employees are not valued at all"
bad,"Working in the pharmacy department at CVS does not feel like a healthcare job, it's more like being a salesman,  instead of cars we are constantly calling and telling patients to fill prescription. Many are as needed and do not need monthly refills. Also we are mostly understaffed, can not properly train new people, state law 10 min break can not be taken due to no staff"
bad,"I have had tremendous professional growth , and truly loved every part of my job , sadly due t blatant dishonestly from upper management , my career has come to an end"
bad,"This company has no compassion for their employees . Unless you work in Pharmacy where the money is made , you are second class . Hours get cut weekly and you are always required to do more with less . It is not family friendly and the district manager had favorites . And if you weren’t on his side your fate was already set ."
bad,CVS Health is purely profit driven and will kill you to get to target. It does not care about employees or patients. It is a filthy company and hope everyone will soon see this. Bottom of the barrel.
bad,"My experience as a clerk for CVS was terrible. The management always tried to belittle me. I was extremely unhappy here. I am thankful I am no longer apart of this business. The job itself, was easy and doable. The coupon system and price system was always organized. The management made me leave."
bad,"At this company, you are less than your actual utility. The more capable are given extreme responsibility, then cast aside. My boss was unfairly fired and I was promoted. His warning came true. I have never worked for a more dehumanizing company."
bad,"A typical day at work involved running (sometimes literally) from registers in the store front to registers in pharmacy to attempt to appease the many customers patronizing the business. I learned quickly how to converse with customers and patience frustrated about a lack of personal attention and wait times regarding prescriptions. The culture could best be defined as ""high stress"" as the staffing policies essentially ensured there was no time to take breaks in a day if you wanted to complete all the expected tasks while keeping customer frustration to a minimum."
bad,"Stressful, unorganized, underpaid, no training, no one plans! Cut throat management! 50-100lb boxes daily/OT expected! 1 break if you are lucky! Sucks"
bad,"This company does not respect workers in their pay or time. They try to get people to work off the clock (unwritten rule, part of the company culture) by having high workload demands. Stay away if you want a respectful environment"
bad,"Cvs has zero concern for patient safety or accuracy. Management scolds you for spending time counselling patients and that it should just be a ""quick check"" that the pills look right. Pharmacy is so much more than that and patients deserve better quality care. My staff and I would go entire shifts without using the bathroom, sometimes 10 hour days, because CVS wanted to save on payroll and cut"
bad,The pay is ok. Hours include 9-10 hour shifts with no breaks. The optimization is crazy. A lot of equipment needs to be replaced. Job can be very stressful.
bad,"CVS has poor job satisfaction. You are running to "" beat the clock"" as timed on EVERYTHING, including quickness to phone, opening drive thru window( sensors), and "" promised time"", but can have 40 to 90 + rx's due in 15 minutes!One second late is as bad as 2 days late. CVS culture,rules are all about not trusting employee. Have to leave work jacket in rx to go to bathroom! Pat downs, pocket and bag checks on camera ,etc whenever leave store"
bad,"I enjoyed almost every day i worked there. great clientele, easy enough fast paced job. u must be able to multi task. The environment is good. The chance for advancement is slim to none and no benefits whatsoever. except for time and a half on Sundays. company cvs brand 30% discount. All other items are 20% off. Lots of youngsters working who like drama."
bad,"Policies are worst. "
bad,"The pay rate for Pharmacy Techs is the lowest of the low at CVS. The company does not care about their employees health! The don't care about loyalty. They treat their employees badly and with no respect. No bonuses! Yearly raises or low it is barely worth it. I wouldn't recommend CVS for a job unless they paid me a whole lot of money to lie! My management score is high only because of my manager personally. He went out on a limb for us every time! Unfortunately, other managers do not compare."
bad,"CVS is a frantic paced job with the manager doing all the work. You are lucky to have a,cashier and often so not. Everything is about the almighty buck with this company"
bad,"The manager that ran the store was the reason why I left.  She didn't help me to devolp or grow in anyway with the company.  I only worked nights and the graveyard shift.  Plus, I almost got robbed one night working at the store.  That night was one of the scariest nights of my life.  I did love my co-workers and still miss them."
bad,"This is the worst company I have EVER worked for. They are so consistently understaffed which means things rarely get done when they are supposed to. This leads to most customers being upset when their medications are not ready and the techs have to bear the burden of that. On top of that, they cut the hours to a ridiculous level. And then they complain about their employees quitting; when they are barely making ends meet with the hours they give"
bad,Unless it is unavoidable and you are financially unstable I would avoid employment with this company there is no reasonable work life balance and the stress level is very high.
bad,"CVS treats employees poorly, forcing you to slave long hours w/ no breaks while trying to meet impossible metric goals.  MTM is borderline unethical & certainly not in the best interest of the patient. The atmosphere is stressful as they will only allow you to run on a less than skeleton crew. Their reward system is a joke; after 19 yrs I had enough points for an Echo Dot, $39.99 value. Thank you and good riddance!"
bad,"A new day in healthcare? Sure, if you think that entails gross understaffing, unattainable metric driven goals and overwhelming workloads. If your career goal involves bleeding ulcers, exhaustion, mental fatigue and burnout, then this is the company for you."
bad,"Management was extremely rude and self centered. Higher ups did not care when management was rude to customers and employees. I had opened an ethics case and nothing was recovered, even called the district manager and still nothing. No sympathy at all."
bad,"Working at this particular CVS Pharmacy was quite awful. First off, the pharmacy manager does not know what he is doing and is very disrespectful towards the pharmacy staff...like to the point where he made an employee cry. Working with him was a nightmare. I could never talk to him or ask him to do something for a customer that was waiting because he would always ignore me for some reason. Part of the problem is that he is always on the phone during his shifts. Other employees said he was on conference calls, but the fact that he was laughing while speaking another language truly says different. Overall, he is just very unprofessional and quite rude. Unfortunately, the store manager is not much different. There have been multiple instances in which I would text my pharmacy manager and/or the store manager for reasons that were pretty serious, and both of them would ignore me. I honestly don't know what was up with these guys and ignoring  me and my messages. Some of the employees were nice, while others were very rude and biased. Even though I am a CERTIFIED pharmacy technician, 9 out 10 times I would only be allowed to work the register at the pickup or drive thru. I was never allowed to really do much in production or in the triage. Yet, when one of the former associate store managers decided she wanted to work back in the pharmacy, they let her work the different sections and didn't make her stick to just doing the register...even though she does not yet have her pharmacy technician certification. There is blatant favoritism at this store and it is just sad. They have people"
bad,"if you dont want a social/personal life and want to be abuse physically and mentally, then this is the place. This company does not care for the patients well being nor for their employees well being."
bad,Stressful as a retail pharmacy technician and employess dont get recognized. You're expected to do so much more with all the hours being cut on top of your job.
bad,"Started working here because I was in desperate need of a job. Worst job I've ever worked. Management left a bit to be desired, the store was so dirty that there were mice running around on the sales floor at times and the amount of people I've seen get fired or quit made me feel like my job was always in jeopardy. It's not very fulfilling either. Overall, I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone, even if it's a last resort."
bad,"The only thing good about this job is the health insurance. You get great discounts on meds and many with no copays. You also get covered on drugs that most would not get covered or would have a huge copay. As a pharmacy service rep your on the phone with angry people. Your micromanaged to the point where you have to click the mouse every 30 seconds or the manager gets a report that your not clicking enough to show productivity. I literally found my right hand fingers twitching in my sleep from the habit. The pay is not great. For a fortune 500 company this is the cheapest corporate company. You get a 3% once year raise if you ""meet expectations"".  Coworkers would cover their chairs with plastic in hopes to avoid bed bugs. Management had us remove food from desks to detour the mice. Then I'm on a call and a mouse scurrys by. I WAS IN SHOCK. Coworkers screamed and management was angry because callers could hear. They force OT and look at you sideways if you don't do it. They will put you in a hotel for intense snow days but your expected to work in office until the office closes. Fast forward to employer client benefits they don't want to train you. Your expected to figure it out on your own. Only benefit is work from home. However on this side there is HARDLY no OT if you work 1 hour over 40 your having a conversation with management. The problem is there is so much work that you need to work off clock and many do. During weclome seasons there is plenty of OT and you have no life because its mandatory. Work here at your own risk. If you have pharmacy experience you'll be able"
bad,This company does not give two cares about any of their employees.  I was robbed at gunpoint at 1130pm and they expected me to stay open the rest of the night.
bad,The amount of task is unobtainable with the amount of hours given. The daily work is often rushed and incomplete because there is no help to perform task correctly.
bad,To stressful for the little amount of pay! District and regional managers are never satisfied. Less time with customers in store due to upkeep and patient follow up calls on the phone that has to be made almost daily.
bad,Been working for the company for almost 10 years now. It’s just getting worst on how they treat the employees. All they care about is numbers & percentages. They will not give you more hours to hire. They expect you to get everything done when you don’t even have enough people to do the job. Customer’s always come in upset because there medicine isn’t ready. We do the best we can and it just hurts me when I’m there to help a customer and CVS can’t even give it’s employees the help we need. More hands on deck! PLEASE
bad,"There has been a huge shift in CVS corporate over the past year which involves a lot of downsizing, changing of top leaders which unfortunately then affects everyone else working in the stores. District Leaders expect everyone to do the jobs of 3 people in a store that only one person may be working now because so many people have had to be let go. Work life balance is laughable. You have no other life except to spend it at work on your time off and if you are not at work on your time off then you are a bad employee. Days off are spent in meetings you are not getting paid for which might be ok if they were productive but most the time are not."
bad,"Cut tech hours customers are last concern in this company. It is all about the green stuff to upper management."
bad,They dont Care about employees truck days horrible had to make sure all the boxes are done before u leave if it wasnt u get wrote up. U call in u get wrote up work hrs cant get overtime or have a fixed schedule because they are cheap. The only great thing that was good was making customers happy. They only care about money nothing else
bad,"Cvs doesn’t care about their employees. They took away my full time status and benefits in part because I had a medical leave of absence and part because my manager couldn’t give me enough hours. Customers get better coupons than the employee discount and can use them on more than employees can use their discount on. They don’t pay overtime for hours physically worked on a holiday week. They owe me $650 that I have been fighting for for three years. I’ll never see it. Managers used to buy dinner (nothing extravagant... just a pizza or grinder) for employees working major holidays and they won’t allow that anymore. They keep taking away hours and adding more work. Stupid, unnecessary tasks that take too much time. There is no room for advancement. They hire from outside before giving positions to well qualified employees."
bad,"Worked at same location for 34 years. Recently retired. Not a card or message from management congratulating me on being able to put up with their bs for that long.  I actually wanted to work for a couple more years but between the metrics, constantly being grossly understaffed, having coworkers threatened by DM I decided to get out.  I’m glad I did. Feel sorry for young pharmacists just starting out. My advice to them would be find a job where you are at least appreciated"
bad,"I used to love working for this company (been here 14 years total) until about 2 years ago when the company changed the structure of upper management. With the new structuring, managers are constantly hounded (during and outside of work hours) regarding every possible metric. I actually dread getting a notification from my district leader because there is always something wrong (customer service score, cycle counts done late, PCQ calls with only 1 attempt, etc.) and there is hardly ever any recognition for things done well. We are being micromanaged to the nth degree. My home life has suffered, my relationships with my friends and family have suffered, my health has suffered. I know of other managers who quit without notification and without a back up plan. I'm a single parent and cannot afford to leave without another job lined up. I have broken down and cried numerous times due to frustration and hopelessness. I wouldn't recommend CVS to my worst enemies. On top of all this, they have made it next to impossible for pharmacists to get a raise (I got $0.35 this year with a meets expectation and end of year script count 12% above budget), increased insurance costs, and cut technician hours to help save money for the bottom line of the company. I feel like they can no longer provide safe, quality pharmacy services."
bad,"Work life balance needs improvement"
bad,"I worked for the Aetna Prior Authorization Team. This PA team is far better than the CVS Health Commercial PA Team... it's less confusing and much easier in my opinion. "
bad,Company is the worst placed I have ever worker for. The upper management plays favorites. The schedules are horrible. No family life balance. The employees are probably the only best part about the company. Upper management knows company is understaffed and will not do anything about. HORRIBLE company to work at. I do not recommend anybody to work here.
bad,"- Not much is required but if you are only standing behind a register for 4+ hours you will be miserable. When given other things to do, it is better than being at the register"
bad,You have to work 3 jobs in order to get the expected work load done. This company need to hire more technicians to meet the volume of the store. This is a great company but poor management
bad,"I learned from the beginning that this job is a lot to take on. I started out with 2 other techs but then by the time the busiest time of year came along I was alone. 2 Pharmacists and I. It was awful but we made it through. We then were able to hire on some helpful hands. We were number one in the district, however my coworkers again moved on. Now we have enough people, but corporate has decided to cut our hours back so badly that we have 1 tech and 1 pharmacist working. There are 3 Full-time techs employed. None of us are getting full time hours. On average I'm getting 27 hours a week. Not enough to survive on. This all falls on corporate, and when they are questioned, its the only option they have."
bad,"Expect to work understaffed and be held accountable for metrics that are unattainable.   Zero work-life balance.  They keep cutting back help and expect you to pick up the slack on your time/days off.   You’ll be lucky if your work less than 60hrs a week, 20 of which will be not paid to complete your required tasks or you’ll be held accountable.  Intimidation from upper management practically on a daily basis.  I fear for the patients safety in a pharmacy that is so severely understaffed with pharmacists so drastically overworked."
bad,Only stayed employed as long as I did because the pharmacist were awesome and showed genuine care for employees and patients.  Our workflow was amazing which made everyday smooth.  Pharmacy Technicians just don't get paid enough.
bad,I have worked for CVS since Oct 2017 and I am on my 5th boss.  The upper management is terrible and the turn around in each department is ridiculous.  My job itself is great and I love helping patients and getting them on the road to recovery.   If they changed the upper management I think more people would stay.
bad,"The pay compared to your work load is terrible. You are responsible for pretty much doing everything in the pharmacy and only get paid min wage. I was there 2 years and when I was leaving i just reached $10 an hour. The coworker and managers are great people at this location, but the company itself takes advantage of the workers and expects so much of them without offering any incentive. The managers have no say or control of the benefits or pay offered to you or otherwise they would do something about it. Your pretty much bottom of the food chain while making money for the big corporation."
bad,"CVS is fully driven by bogus metrics that don't in any way help you deliver positive patient outcomes. They will do whatever they can to maximize profits, including constantly cutting technician and pharmacist help while increasing aforementioned metrics."
bad,"After working at an independent pharmacy for 20 years, I knew how to treat my customers like they were family. Never been so ashamed of the level of customer service provided after CVS bought them... Just worked a 12 hour shift in a store with only one tech and no clerk but we had a drive thru, registers, drop off and production all to man. Phones couldn't get answered, drive thru window was attended to as soon as possible but was pitiful. CVS just cut hours for the new budget in January, busiest time of the year. Very few stores have reliable base of competent tech because the hiring is so slow and the training so cumbersome. Thank you Indeed for helping us find options."
bad,"CVS has provided me with a strong leadership background. I have held many positions with this company, from staff Pharmacist to Pharmacy Supervisor. Unfortunately lately the company has greatly decreased our technician hours inside the store, which makes it very difficult to perform the job of a Pharmacist in a safe manner."
bad,CVS cares very little for its employees. Increased work load was given in exchange for decreased hours. I would never encourage pharmacists to choose this company.
bad,If you looking for a career this not the place managment sucks the phone ringing off the hook  from open to close  mind you they to lazy to hire more reps. To take these calls but they want to punish you not being fast taking the calls  If you want a piece of mind don't work there...This how you know this company is jacked up if you have people  brand new coming out of training  how in the world. During training you taught them the new system that is coming out 2019 but you did not train them in the old system. But you tell the trainers  For the new employees to take the calls that's in the queue but they don't know nothing about the old system.  BEWARE
bad,Poor ethics working condition with the company. I feel like the top management is doing their job and the lower rank and files are not. That is my review
bad,"management only cares about the bottom line.  they do so many things to protect themselves, but do not do things that are in the best interest of the patients."
bad,"i am not in a position to review this company at this time. CVS has excellent job security, that is an upside. possibly the best compensation in the industry as well."
bad,"Worked at CVS pharmacy for 3+ years, it was horrible! My first shifts I felt like I was kicked into the ocean without learning how to swim. Co-workers didn't help and management was terrible.  I was Inventory Specialist after 2 years working there and EVERYTHING was on me. And I mean EVERYTHING! No one helped me out but always asked for my help. I always stood extra hours to help out on trying to finish prescriptions that we didn't get filled because of the INTENSE workflow. Always getting yelled at by management for not keeping up on the prescriptions that came in because of no help from anyone. When I did my best by helping my coworkers and satisfying customers request, I NEVER got any recognition for my work. NO advancement or bonuses, VERY low pay for the work I perform! I could keep going on and on and on but I'm tired of reliving these terrible shifts I received while I worked at CVS."
bad,Had the worse boss ever which made it the worse place to work. Worked there for 14 +yrs until she decided it didn’t work for her anymore. Had never been written up for anything but she sure found something!!! I will really miss my patients.
bad,One of the reasons for leaving this place is management. They just treat you like a number and its a shame that one bad apple ruins it for everyone. Pretty much all of the customers that come into that place are rude and treat you like garbage. I always had a terrible days at that place I'm not sure how I survived.
bad,Too much drama. Some employees are lazy. Definitely not recommended for a first time job. You need to have a very thick skin to work there. Be prepared to work the afternoon shift. Their benefits are ok.
bad,"doctor calls turned into a call center, amount of calls per hour is all that matters. used to be a nice place to work. There is  no advancement opportunities"
bad,Very hard place to work. The hours are awful. Understaffed. Increasingly difficult working conditions. Hard metrics to meet. Very hard to get all tasks completed on a daily basis in time. No time to have an actual conversation with patients.
bad,"low compensation"
bad,"CVS owns an isurance company (Caremark) so they can drive prices on drugs. This has resulted in loss of coverage for many drugs for their customers, and those with their insurance (such as employees). All of their pharmacies feature hard-as-a-rock concrete floors, and lights so bright you leave with a migraine every day. 10-hour shifts are common, with minimal opportunity to get off your feet. Breaks are not guarenteed, and if you work at a CVS inside of a Target, your employee discount is useless, as it doesn't apply to Target merchandise. The computer system leaves you no room for autonomy, and holds your hand through each prescription whether you like it or not. It really slows the process down and makes filling some medications so frustrating it's almost not worth coming to work."
bad,"This is the kind of career that wasn't for me. But being older and handicapped seemed to make a difference, it seemed. Too bad. They have a great idea but too many ""cooks in the kitchen:."
bad,"Yes pay is wonderful but not worth the stress. Management is horrible, I saw more people cry on a daily basis from being under trained and overworked. Again the pay is great but not for your mental health."
bad,"Cvs doesn’t care about there empoloyees . Turn over rate is horrible, they want the pickers to run to make production. They waste no time to write you up & all of the employees fighting & telling on one another just so they can meet numbers . The building is so old , restrooms falling apart . Managers show favoritism, one of the worse companies i have worked for yet !!"
bad,"They did not pay for me to clock back in during my lunch expected to work off lunch hours."
bad,"Corporate cut employee hours, causing us to have to work faster. The customers are usually old rude people. You do not have enough break time. I do not think that we have enough time to ensure a quality product."
bad,Other departments didnt look bad but the department they put me in was the worst.     Coworkers and bosses were okay.  The job itself was terrible.  .
bad,"A typical day at work is taking care of customers, taking prescriptions and inputting in the system. After all that is said and done, the prescriptions are filled and if anything is low on supply or completely out of stock - then we order it. We resolve all third-party issues the customer may have and make sure it gets done in a reasonable amount of time."
bad,"CVS isn't somewhere most of my coworkers see themselves working for a long period of time. There isn't a lot of room to grow except for very few people and most of the management tend to play favorites with certain individuals. The hours we work are very low half of the year, and insanely high the other half. There isn't a lot of consistency and it's hard to get used to the highs and lows."
bad,There isn’t room for advancement. You can work yourself to death and never receive a raise. There is constant verbal abuse from customers and higher managers. The one great benefit is that if ya need hours they will work you plenty.
bad,Very poorly administered company. Decisions are made from people thousands of miles away who have never stepped in the pharmacy nor consulted with the people who do the daily work. The concern of management seems to be numbers and not performance nor attitudes within the workplace. The customers also are neglected because of management protocols and ignoring common sense.
bad,"Management expects you to work 40 plus hours a week even as a college student. Not consideret of employs. Long days of  chaos that never ends, same every day."
bad,A typical day at work is both stressful and pleasant.  The management is horrible.  The hardest part of my job is the rude customers and management.  And most enjoyable part of the job is working with the other cashier and one of the manager.
bad,"slavery"
bad,"This corporation does not care about its employees, from the cashier position to managers. There is so high of a turnaround rate at any store you visit. I don't even see the point of having a front store when most of the profit is made in the pharmacy. Pay here is atrocious, but at the same time not difficult."
bad,"When I first started at CVS, the company cared about their employees. When I left, we were only numbers on a screen to them. They no longer cared about proper store coverage for safety -- staff frequently worked alone and required to accomplish excessive number of tasks as well."
bad,It was a high volume call center dealing with older clients enrolled in Medicare Part D.  They hired tons of temp employees for enrollment season and let them go.  The trainer was from out of town and could care less if you knew what you were doing because your contract date was ending soon
bad,Skeleton crew for help and management not helpful.  The hours are always being cut for both staff pharmacists and techs.  The goal is one tech and one pharmacist
bad,"Employees held responsible for things not in job description. Field management favors certain employees,  ignores issues brought to their attention by anyone not favored, expects employees to work hours without being paid."
bad,Excess pressue and not enough time to do tasks leading to higher risk of errors.  Management typically assigns alternate work locations without firm basis.
bad,"Was a great place to work at the beginning but the people in charged"
bad,"CVS does not respect their employees. Not all employees are treated equally. There is a lot of favoritism. If you are a hard worker, like myself, they will abuse you and not allow you to progress in the company."
bad,The most enjoyable thing working for Cvs was the co-workers nd members. Incoming calls taken to place orders for medications to be mailed to them. Also speaking with local pharmacies. Giving membe pharmacy plan information for their benefits.
bad,"Customers are very rude, "
bad,You are scored as a employee on how fast you move not how many mistakes made or if customer satisfied it's a battle between the pharmacies............
bad,CVS doesn't care about the patient or the employee. It's all about meeting a number for a greedy corporation and not about providing customer service.  They don't support the pharmacy staff because they don't provide enough pharmacy technician hours at any location iv'e ever worked at.  This stresses out the staff which in turn stresses out the customer and then nobody is happy.
bad,No one I worked with worked there for much longer than I did.  Couldn't trust managers.  Direction from leadership wasn't made clear to employees.  Awful culture.
bad,"stressful environment, and lack of sufficient employees to get the job done is a typical day at work. Poor management at corporate level for managing large scale retail pharmacy."
bad,The pharmacy i worked was tolerable and the manager was amazing. She was very organized and knew how to run a business. Everything else is a nightmare. The demands corporate wanted from are unrealistic plus all the stress you get from trying to obtain outrageous expectations
bad,"The company doesn't give you enough tech hours, therefore you end up shouldering the responsibility for more people than are staffed at any given time. The prevalent feeling among all of the employees I've worked with (at multiple locations) is that the company doesn't care about its employees. All it cares about is cutting corners and shareholder value. As a pharmacy technician, you work extremely stressed out during your entire shift. The pay does not reflect this. It is a miserable job."
bad,"Manager was great, staff in the pharmacy not so much. Your thrown into positions going into it, not knowing what to do, and the staff is not welcoming at all. Played favorites.... and poor guidance and leadership roles from the lead pharmacy technician, and pharmacist. No team work, very negative energy."
bad,"cvs has to compensate better to keep employees "
bad,"Chances are, you're not going to be working with geniuses at a cash register. Everyone has drama, everyone is upset because they don't get the hours they want each week, everyone thinks everyone is lazy...no one really cares about that store..."
bad,Does not care about Employees. .Raises once a year were Very poor. Benefits Poor...Company waste a lot of money..Does not have enough employees per shifts..
bad,"CVS Pharmacy is the largest growing pharmacy in America. The environment is tense and cutthroat, no room for mistakes. Stressful and frustrating. The patients will not tolerate any mistakes."
bad,i like the people that I work with but feel that upper management really look for ways to have you fail .we work at a fast paste so it made the days go fast they would not match your 401 until after a year people that have work there for a while would help you with any problem.
bad,"Just run! Do not work here. A store manager in training are getting paid more money  than a SM with a grad degree. Very demanding on their employees with no hours. You need to be willing to work hard your entire shift with no down time. You also need to be an excellent multitasker. Be ready to deal with extreme couponers and very nasty customer bases that are trying to get everything for free. Most store are high theft because of lack of staff in the building. You need to be ready to break down and unpack an entire truck by yourself. You will also be a cashier and work with a terrible computer system that is constantly going down or running slow.district managers take advantage of their good employees and move them all over to clean up the messes that poorly trained store managers made. Extremely high expectations with very little payroll or gratitude. As a salaried member of management you are expected to cover any shifts that are needed, stay late or come in early when necessary (which is excessive). You are expected to attend a meeting once a month, which does not come out of your store payroll budget, it is entirely free to the company. Also, your salaried ""45 hours"" is calculated with the hourly employees payroll. You absolutely will work more than 45 hours consistently. Average hours per week for a store manager is around 60 hours. You are also expected to work holidays with no extra pay, as well as at the very least 2 weekends a month, and you will also have to work at least 2 closing shifts a week. The workload to available manpower ratio is completely unbalanced which"
bad,"I have sadly worked retail since I graduated from college, and CVS is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They care more about their customers than they do their employees and the pay rate clearly show it."
bad,"""Profits above all!"" is the real motto of CVS. Forget about customer service or work-life balance. Understaffing to the point of risking patient safety and pharmacist livelihood is the reason I'm leaving. I transitioned to CVS after the Target Pharmacy buy-out. To witness the dramatically different circumstances created by the two companies is shocking. CVS is too cheap to maintain an adequate float pool, so say goodbye to taking vacation and say hello to daily emails and texts asking staff pharmacists to cover open shifts at other stores (no overtime pay). CVS institutes demeaning and demoralizing working conditions and corporate culture."
bad,"CVS was a very poor company to work for. No raises, very poor management. They constantly added to  my work load & job responsibilities all while cutting hours. No place for promotion"
bad,"Always understaffed, underpaid, and extremely busy. Managers at my store were amazing people who cared about their staff but unfortunately the corporation doesn't."
bad,This is by far the worst company I’ve ever worked for. To be considered in the healthcare industry this company has a complete lack of interest for the patients they serve. Their primary focus is the bottom dollar and helpful their pockets are at the end of the day.
bad,cvs pharmacy in Buckhannon wv  when I first started as a pharmacy tech on my first day the pharmacy manager was very rude to me wasn't at all helpful trying to fit in to my job . didn't like  my job there at all the manager  took all the ambition I had because on my first day she was so rude to me I was done it wasn't the place I felt comfortable and that I could give my all.
bad,"Many times working alone with no other employee on floor, thefts were out of control. Safety was my main concern, I am a man and many times they left women working alone and very unsafe. No security and there was no concern for security for staff. Staffing at stores was inconsistent and some store had enough employees and others not nearly enough. Many times to go get lunch i would have to leave and this would leave only one person in the front of the store. Lack of company policy to prosecute thefts and repeat thieves. The thieves were treated better than the employees."
bad,"The amount of work you are expected to do is ridiculous. most technicians make minimum wage, but for what is expected of you, and how stressful it is, its far too little. They have a cap on pay, which is very low. theres never enough employees and every problem at the store, its blamed on us, when in reality its problems in the corporate level. they do not appreciate their employees."
bad,This job is extremely stressful if at a remotely busy store. Corporate does not care at all about their employees and considers them all easily replaceable. At the end of the day the game is all about meeting metrics instead of providing any sort of decent patient care.
bad,"CVS Health's reputation precedes it. Not much can be added to what has already been posted, and much of which is not positive. Great job for the naive and in-debt."
bad,"A great summary of this place is expressed in what one manager told the whole floor at the end of a meeting about new company policies, ""Everyone is expendable.  If you do not want to be here, then there's the door.  There are plenty of people who need jobs.""  Great philosophy, eh?"
bad,"worst pharmacy ever in the world"
bad,"Very strict, they hover over you, if you are not improving in your job they will find ways to get  you fired. They don't care about your personal life. they will not work with you"
bad,The people that you work with are rude. It is filled with drama and negativity. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for a career in pharmaceuticals.
bad,Employee morale at an all time low.Pay is lower then other retail companies. And breaks are never or vary few.company basis your evaluation on how the store as a whole does and not how you did which is vary discouraging.
bad,This place is terrible. Start you at minimum wage and even after getting licenses and certifications they still don't give raises unless u literally fight for it and even then it's a buck or 2. You are so over worked you get burnt out very quickly. Call you in on your days off constantly. Customers are always so rude and fighting with you because there scripts are never ready which is true cause your too busy filling ready fills that half the time don't even get picked up. I do have to say all the pharmacists I worked with were super nice and all my co-workers became like a 2nd family to me. Also great starter place because you do learn a lot of the drugs and what they are used for. That was the only plus to working at that place. Also corporate is always there looking over your shoulder it's really frustrating.
bad,"It's not the Company that is the issue it's the management. I wish "
bad,CVS today is very stressful and they do not teach pharmacy staff all of the duties. Technicians who are very qualified end up simply operating a register.
bad,Unstable/buyout. Management was too stressed about company instability to care about day to day operations. High turnover led to long hours to take care of daily operations.
bad,"Get out fast, don't get stuck in this place. The pay is really low, and the work demand is really high, if you work a CVS, that is really busy, you will be over worked and under paid."
bad,"CVS will go to any length to save a buck. They spread employees so thin it's exhausting.  They do nothing when you report things to their ""ethics"" hotline."
bad,"TL:DR  Don't work here."
bad,With this company they did not provide training on how they use their systems or how they process their claims. I was expected to watch someone do their job then I was thrown on my own work. Management was not willing to help me when I asked for it.  I was always told to go ask someone else on the team.
bad,"This job was extremely stressful.  There is entirely too much work for as few employees work there.  It is a very ""high school"" like environment. You are either a ""popular"" kid and work is a fun place to socialize, or you are not and people are outcast and treated poorly (even by management).  The job is fast pace, and mistakes can be life threatening to the clients.  It is extremely stressful, poorly managed and extremely deficient in pay."
bad,"you will stay broke. its a job that is about politics,meaning if your not what there into you wont have any help for your self they will not compromise even if your family passes away"
bad,You are literally being read to for training without having any hands on training. A lot of information shoved down your throats. I believe CVS is trying its hardest to get you to do more without paying you more. The trainers don't answer your questions and are pretty much new trainers. Their are multiple systems you have to learn because upper management doesn't want to pay for a better system. Software is outdated.
bad,"Loved the job itself but so much drama with employees. It was very unprofessional. They would fight, talk about each other behind each other's back and argue all the time. Manager was very favoritism of employees."
bad,CVS has turned into a company that values profits over people.  It seems that every change that has happened over the last several years has been about maximizing profits.  One of the most noticeable changes is the cap that CVS implemented saying that an employee can only make so much money based on their job title and not what they actually do.
bad,They pay well but it's not equal opportunity all the time even though they say it is. The job it self is not hard if you have call center experience. Even if you don't they will give you time to learn. Best advice is to stay away from the he say she say.
bad,"Typical Call center...you feel like you are one in the number, the calls are mentally DRAINING!!! The benefits are good and they DO work with your school schedule."
bad,Management was run like a high school clique. If you kept your head down and learned/worked fast you are fine. But I did not trust the people I was working under.
bad,"Work you like a slave for minimum pay. Make you feel like a dispensable robot and consistently annoy you about numbers (customer satisfaction, etc). A 4/5 satisfaction rating is equivalent to 0/5. Avoid the job unless you need money desperately."
bad,Work was stressful and lots of micro management. Opportunity to transfer after 3 years of experience was futile.  Company focuses on profits over employees.  Show more respect to your long time employees so that you can retain talent and lower turnover ratio
bad,CVS Health is becoming a toxic place to work.  Older employees are targeted for release.  Our manager was promoted then used as a hatchet person to terminate 7 people over 6 months. Aware of 2 people not in immediate workgroup who had perfect reviews then they couldn't do anything right. Virtually no training.  Upper C-level management on right track but mid-management is running a-muck!
bad,"CVS did not make it to the top by being nice to the employees."
bad,"Over worked and under appreciated "
bad,upper management keeps cutting hours even as number of rx filled keeps increasing. they keep putting more and more work on rph's and they keep burning out. its no wonder the turnover rate is so high
bad,"CVS Health does not value their employees.  It is a ego-driven culture and management, or ""leadership"" as they like to call it is constantly struggling for control.  Even though innovation, caring and integrity are their core values, they do not practice this in the work environment.  Their middle school shenanigans are exhausting and they kill any ounce of creativity, collaboration, hard work ethic, or innovation you might have.  If you want to work here, grab your popcorn and join the circus.  I'm looking forward to my next opportunity to move on!"
bad,typical work day was filled with things to do in the pharmacy there is always things to do because people always need medication. The management was friendly.
bad,They don't do annual reviews and reward bad employees people often call off most time with no consequence two people are expected to do the work of the other two technicians that are standing around
bad,Great place to work however management was not encouraging. I worked there for 12 years and then let go due to jealousy. I had a great repor with patients and co workers
bad,The hours work well with the school schedule but unfortunately there is no room for growth. The pay is horrible. Underpaid with multiple degrees. The time to leave is now
bad,Upper Management does the bare minimum while expecting all employees to give 120%.  Given endless tasks on top of daily duties while only given a skeleton crew of people.
bad,"Retail is not a easy career. I typically worked more than required to ensure everything was done and the store was in tip top shape. I loved the employees that I had and still have friendships with them. When maintaining a 24 hour retail pharmacy, there is no such thing as a set schedule, and is not ideal for single families."
bad,I had only been with the company for a couple of weeks before they started training me on how to do my bosses job when he was away on vacation.  The training was very intense and I felt way underpaid for the work that they were expecting from me. New job responsibilities were added to my work load weekly.
bad,Drama Drama Drama!! Little positivity and management... Well..work here and find out for yourself. It's a shame. I enjoy my work but am always stepped down on. Nothing is done as promised. There are better opportunies out there. Just read all the other reviews and they truly speak volume for what this company is and lacks!
bad,"They say they care but show you how much they don't. Management treats you like dirt so they can't stay fully staffed and the techs that are there have to work overtime because it can't stay fully staffed. Heaven forbid management be accountable for anything. Ask for help and you get more work unless you are a butt kisser that can't handle your workload then you get help. And promotions or position changes are only given when benefitting management. How does someone who is not a pharmacist nor a certified tech run a pharmacy?  Learn to do the job before ypu try to tell me how to do it!"
bad,"No proper training, supervisors lack professionalism and supervisory skills. Omnicare doesn't  care about your family life or illnesses they want you to show up on your death bed!! No such thing as an excused absence even with a doctors note!!"
bad,"For starters they are closing down all their sites to consolidate to AZ. We just had a career fair to bring new people in only to find out they are shutting everything down. So for those people that we just hired they are losing their job now. That right there is a perfect example of how this place works. The fat cats at the top step all over the people doing the work and you will never feel valued, appreciated or anything else that makes you want to come to work. Senior leadership is the worst and they have no idea what they are doing. Literally, a trained monkey on a type writer would make more sense then the people that are ""leading"" this place. They make goals that no one can ever accomplish. In the rare case you actually meet your goal you don't receive credit. They say they are a pay for performance company and that's laughable at best. Raises if any are below industry average and everyone is disposable to them except the senior leaders that some how still have a job. Now that they are closing down their billing sites you'd think it was because senior leadership was such a joke they would want to wipe the slate clean. No instead Senior leadership gets to keep their jobs and the people that actually do the work are let go. So in the end the short coming of an actual leadership team cost good people their job. Senior leaders don't care about anyone or have a vested interest in ""healthcare"" just making cash. Hand down the worst job I've ever had, co workers and all."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of reporting and answering questions from branch management who lack basic Excel skills. IT and database problems happen almost everyday. Some team member needed to call service desk every day to reset password. Databases often fail to update properly which delays reporting. This is the primary reason why I rate this company 1/5. You can't have so many technical issues when you operate in a competitive industry. "
bad,"Where do I begin. It is sad when my trainer said on day one that     C V S is one of top 10 companies with the worst customer service images. Saturday or Sunday depending on your store you are taking down tags & putting up 1500 to 2000 tags per week that were the same tags with the same sales info from last week for the most part. Corporate should let sales tags go for more than 1 week. This task is hard to do with coupon customers coming in all day filling their baskets with the sale items then you are having to run restock the shelves with product & no way to enforce a limit. Then product is out then customers get upset. Other customers that come to purchase a few items then they end up leaving empty handed & fustrated because there is only 2 associates ringing up customers & both of you are tied up with coupon customers that have multiple sales. NEED MORE HELP. Tasks that leave the registers unattended that gives customers an uneasy feeling when they walk in the store especially at night & when the pharmacy is closed. With that customers look for assistance in the store & more time is wasted since you have to walk up to the front to ring them up."
bad,Most of the time it was just myself and a pharmacist. I would be running all over the place trying to keep things running smoothly and the pharmacist would just be standing there checking prescriptions.
bad,"work for a very large corporation"
bad,"Typical day at work: Routing all faxes and mail. Initial quick review of all pre-authorization requests, returning if information needed is missing. Maintain all medical records, first reviewing to see if needed for review of a request, or just filing. Make new client charts. Pull all enrollment letters for new client charts. Communicate with adjusters daily with help in retrieving records from providers or to assisting providers in obtaining authorization. Also routinely request updated claim information from adjusters. Assist with answering incoming calls from provider's and on occasion injured workers. Assist in sending out approval and disapproval letters. Dailey coverage of front desk reception lunch hour. Various other duties as needed."
bad,Working for Cvs was a easy job to catch onto. I do think the employees should be more welcoming. I've came across a lot of pharmacist who very stressed from work and will have you running in circles on the job. I must say that my pharmacist was the nicest man but when I went to other stores to fill in other managers will be so funny acting that a new person will quit.
bad,"But at least it's a job.. if you don't mind being overworked, understaffed, never getting even a bathroom break, multiple 15 hour days with no time to eat even a sandwich, constant undertrained technician turn-over and no-shows, no overlap ever, being called up short notice for shifts at other stores all the time, bosses that always have heart attacks and hate their jobs"
bad,Okay so I really miss working at my old CVS. My new CVS is not welcoming at all. I feel like there is a clique of girls and when i'm at work I feel very unwelcome. I don't feel  comfortable going to my pharmacist for anything.
bad,"You can start your shift off with a quick overview of the days goals and task with your supervisor, then usually go to work! For example, either register duties, or stocking shelves and what not."
bad,Working here has been a fun place to be people were nice boss was nice and the hours where good.I loved working there.This will be a good place to work
bad,Working at Omnicare has been a fun place to be at you go in get your work done and there will be no problems.We have pizza days we have days where we dress down the people are easy to get along with and the hours are good.
bad,"Leadership is the companies downfall. Each day you never know if you will work 8 hours or 12. Management reserves the right to make overtime mandatory on a daily basis as well as working Saturday and Sundays and some weeks with no time off. "
bad,"As this was my first ever job, I feel that it prepared me very well for life as far as learning how to provide customer service and interacting with people (customers and coworkers) on a daily basis. Unfortunately, it also prepared me and actually taught me to expect to be disappointed quite often by management."
bad,"Typical day at work is reaching out quota of 20 patients or more. Critiquing patient's demographics, MD, doctor's orders, diagnosis, insurance verifications. Assisting coworkers, and supervisors with various issues that may occur."
bad,"Great benefits, but the high school type atmosphere is not worth it.  Leadership has their favorites, and is quick to pass the blame when SLAs are not met."
bad,I was hired as MIT( Manager in Training ). My District Manager was ok. But store managers are awful. They won't train you properly. They will take advantage from you and your every day at work will be very hectic. District managers need to know about this. I left because I was tired of those managers dirty games. I do not recommend anybody to work as MIT. There are still good jobs out there.
bad,"People  are proud to work for a long established charity, but the internal working environment/ management has lead to widespread discontent: all this is from their own internal staff review/ survey."
bad,"My day consisted of filling medication, typing prescriptions, customer service, answering multiple phone lines, inventory, and assisting my pharmacist. I learned how to be fast and efficent because this is a high volume store. Managment needed a lot of work as far as organization. I loved my co-workers as we worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the high volume demand and balancing that with outstanding customer service. I enjoyed all of my customers."
bad,"A do more with less culture. Never enough support or tech help. Mangers only push budgets and never support. By not giving enough help the team is left to be yelled at by customers for not being fast enough. When customers complain about speed of service or medications not being complete, the team is blamed by managers for not working within the system properly."
bad,"Lets see...they start technicians in the pharmacy at $10.00 per hour IF you are lucky.  Some are offered lower.  They have ""employee"" restrooms which are shared with the general public.  When general public uses these bathrooms they do all sorts of nasty stuff and there is no one to clean them.  Shouldn't that be illegal?  If it were a restaurant or any other business they would be fined.  Many stores don't even encourage taking breaks.  They are ALWAYS understaffed and it is no wonder they haven't killed anyone as a result.  They give you a 0.02% annual raise.  Meaning if you start at age 18, and get your 0.02% annually you just might clear $14.00/hr by the time your 35.  Some pharmacists have applicants who are supposedly very intelligent and blah blah, pharmacist raves about them and schedules meetings with District Pharmacy Manager and Front Store General Manager and somehow applicant receives $15.00/hr rates with ZERO pharmacy experience because he is supposedly a superstar (right).  So you have basically wasted the last  10 years of your life for some bozo the clown to come in and be compensated higher than you when he knows NOTHING about pharmacy.  Simple put...this company and every other retail chain needs to understand that technicians are the driving force behind the success of the company and compensation needs to be increased in order to keep a happy face on all day.  Staff the stores!!!!  You cheap greedy turds!!!!"
bad,The company overall does not do well with longevity.  My typical work day consisted of me looking over shoulder. Very uncomfortable. My co workers were not the best but you deal with people like this in real world. The hardest part of this job was trying to correct a mistake once it was made. The most enjoyable part of this job was me leaving stress-free.
bad,"Daily: guaranteed abuse from management and less often costumers."
bad,"It starts off promising but the management is absolutely terrible. You cannot go to HR since they are all friends,  so it only comes back at you."
bad,Runs stores with very few hours resulting in overworked staff
bad,"Image incoming documents and direct them to the appropriate department, prepare folders for billing, assist the receptionist in answering a multi-line phone system, file documents appropriately."
bad,"The way a pharmacy works is like an assembly line, with the pharmacist at the very end of it. This assembly line must work as a well oiled machine. If someone needs to take a break, that isn't a problem, as long as someone is there to replace them. However, if there is no pharmacist, the whole thing comes to a screeching halt and can move no farther. The head pharmacist where I worked, would get overwhelmed at our busiest times and go to the back room, Production halted. Our wait times extended."
bad,"I worked at cvs caremark for only a short time. the whole time i was there i wasn't treated fairly. i worked very hard to learn the material in a very short amount off time but it was not enough for the management, they  rushed us through training only to put us on calls where we were cussed at and called names by members. the abuse we took on the phones was ridiculous and then it would all come back to us and we would get reprimanded because of it. to make a long story short. if you like constant verbal abuse from customers as well as management then you will like this place.."
bad,fun happy place. I like working there because I new a lot of people. And people loved to come and see me.
bad,"A typical day at Omnicare is one full of stress, stress, stress. I came from working in huge kitchens so stress and working under pressure is not something new to me. This company brings it to a whole new level though. Their company motto is if you don't like it there's the door! You work very long hours because you're doing the job of at least 2.5 people and are expected to have the work done everyday. You are not going to have any real kind of life outside of this company. The management refuses to actually listen to their employees, who do bring good solutions to some of the problems going on. They skirt around the core problems and instead blame things like you're being too negative. There is no morale with the employees and no clear direction with this company. My co-workers are some of the best people I've ever worked with. Omnicare has a serious problem with their management team. It really does seem like they have no experience in running a LTC company or any company for that matter.  Treat employees with some respect. Acknowledge employees are human and treat them as such. You give points for ""bad"" behavior, but there is no reward for good behavior. Communicate, communicate, communicate. You can't build a team if you are playing employees off of each other."
bad,On call for pharmacists makes this a very difficult job for any pharmacist. Weekend on call is miserable and not worth the small amount earned to be on call. Unpredictable schedule. Clicks within management and administrative staff. Not an ideal job for anyone who wants to maintainable life outside of work.
bad,"love the customer service aspect, building rapport with customers, store level management is wonderful, district and regional have the same issues as most companies. "
bad,"Poor corporate Support.  Too much top end and not enough staff doing what is right for the customers.  They have good people just not utilized to the full potential.  Tend to force change on customers into their business plan vs working collaboratively in establishing workable goals to meet needs of both businesses."
bad,"I report to work usually at 3-4am in the morning and work approximately 8-9 hours a day. You have some management who are concerned how employees feel and some who seem to care less. There's nothing really hard about my job and I do not enjoy my job at all, because it's not what I desire to do. "
bad,"It would be really busy and customers are not always welcoming nor are some of the individuals you work with.  Otherwise my other co-workers were great to work with, because we always helped each other when needed.  However pharmacy management was great, but since it is a retail pharmacy the store management was not as great."
bad,"High turnover, ever changing goal setting and health/dental benefits recently changed to enhance corporate profits."
bad,"A typical day involves handling escalated calls, assist and coach csr's. Place authorization for compound medications and specialty medications. Enter member's eligibility and verify member's benefits. I learned to wear different hats working in this department. I work side by side with management in order to have a smooth transition of work flow each day. My coworkers are special to me we work well together and help each other out."
bad,"This company repeatedly hid the truth or actually lied to pharmacists about the changing environment and future plans. Besides having too little staff and too many side projects required, there are always situations where the company is deceiving both the public and it's employees. The managements concerns are only in numbers and show no real concern for the customer base, and a great lack of respect or honesty for the staff."
bad,CVS is a job that just gets you through to make the bills its a company that doesn't treat its employees like people it treats them like machines. You fill stores orders for their selves. The hours are suppose to be monday- friday 7a-330p but they would come out a half hr before and tell people they have to stay until whenever. The hour recently went to 12 hr days bc of lack of employee due to their large firings due to people not pulling numbers they expect. The most enjoyable part of job was getting to go home.
bad,"This company is TERRIBLE to work for! They EXPECT when you are hired as a Store Manager in Training, that you will work off the clock to ""prove yourself."" Ive seen, personally 3 managers who do it to death and it is sad!!! I have a fiance and a child! I work long hours, hard labor, and get the job done and they paint a target on my back bc im a diabetic and when UNLOADING TRUCKS for 5 weeks straight, i need several breaks because I KEEP bottoming out (blood sugar), and have to stop to LIVE!!! Ive even loaded on candy, sugar water and McDonalds, JUST to make it through the morning... ADA, im miserable...."
bad,"The work days are hectic. they claim to have a ""great workflow setup"" but it's completely inefficient! Wait times are entirely too long because of this. you may start a project, but probably never finish it. they have several ""checks and balances"" in place- but what this really means is 5 different people handle you prescription before its completed. Coworkers are great and the PIC is wonderful, but the upper management is delusional. this company claims they are all about values and customer care......they're all about their bottom line. Bathrooms are gross and the they're such tightwads that the air conditioning is controlled in the corporate office (in Rhode island) what does Rhode island know about Texas weather!"
bad,"Very predictable days at work. I ran the IV room there, at the time it was very unorganized and nobody would take ownership of this position. I took charge and tried to straighten things out and get things organized so things would move smoother. We had hundreds of IV pumps that were going to facilities without being tracked or maintained by the organization. I took it upon myself to create a logging/tracking system to find these pumps, return them to the manufacturer for new ones. My day also consisted of preparing between 200-300 IV medications for 20+ Long Term Care Facilities for the elderly. In additon to this I had to make sure the billing was done correctly, for example the patients insurance was to pay for these medications. If that didnt work out I had to get authorization forms filled out for the facilities to pay for these items. It was very stressful, and there was not alot of support from management."
bad,Very stressful environment. Hours are not very predictable.Management team is not very friendly.
bad,Working for this company was one if the worst professional experiences. From the managers down to the supervisors and team leads they leave a lot to be desired.
bad,"At the time our region had extremely poor store management! Constant issues with understaffing in front of store which would affect pharmacy in negative ways such as managers being tied up at front registers, shortage of store stock supplies (register tape, bags, pens, labels for printers) poorly organized stock rooms. Also infamous for last minute schedule changes and not giving pharmacy enough weekly scheduled hours during cold and flu season to meet customer needs and expectations. Most of my co-workers were amazing and somehow we pulled together with alot of team work and made it through cold and flu season on very limited hours and staff."
bad,"Worst pharmacy to work for. Every couple of months they add on new time-consuming programs they expect you to do with the same amount of help, and monitor if and how you're doing it. Everything you do is tracked, and there is always somebody above you breathing down your neck because there is somebody above them doing the same. This company fosters an environment that forces people to be cut-throat and dishonest in order to get the ""numbers"" that the company wants to see."
bad,"Believe me, they THINK they train you. You are to offer great cust service, you don't even really help these people that call in, you make them happy for the moment until they call again, UPSET, because nothing was done in the first place. They have a Senior staff, that is so backed up with escalated calls you upset people even MORE by keeping them on hold. You get a hold of a supervisor to help, and there response is ""Call a Senior"" What do the supervisors do? All I ever seen was texting and talking to there friends and family in there little ""PRIVATE"" cubicles, or run to HR and tattle on each other and staff like 6 year olds."
bad,"I worked for them for 22 years. Over that time I watched them go from a wonderful customer oriented company into a huge corporation that made numbers their primary focus. They have gone as far as having us call customers at home and practically begging them to refill their prescriptions to increase numbers. While doing this they cut pharmacists and technician hours and expected us to give the same level of service with less help and still bringing in more scripts. This made for a very dangerous situation for the customers well being and safety. When I voiced my concern on the issue I was simply blown off. At that point I new it was time to find another job. The quality of their field management has also greatly declined over the years also. Terrible company to work for, poor quality of life!"
bad,"Work environment is stressful due to lack of help, constant turnover of help, non-caring management with regards to employees. management does not adequately reward employees or provide a"
bad,A company more concerned about numbers than people. Neither
bad,"The district .manager in Macon Ga is a joke.  He is sarcastic, rude, and does not let you have a personal life. The company grades you on the crazyist things.  I wouldn't work for this company ever again"
bad,I worked for cvs for 6 months and they took my job out from under me after they told me that they were going to extend my contract for another 6 months and put me on day hours  I work most of the day thanksgiving day and the very next day I received a text not a phone call a text telling me I didn't need to return to cvs to work   I thought it was mean and cruel to do to someone without any real explanation
bad,cvs is a really nice company to work for i enjoyed time working for them i wish i could find another company that was as good as them but my new job now is a wonderful place to work at and nice guest
bad,Don’t do it if you desire to have a life. They will slave you. Always understaffed 1 pharmacist and 1 tech most of the time. Your expected to be able to multitask to the max. Bare minimum training
bad,"Racist employees, old bitter ladies. Management hides so they dont have to deal with bs going on. White supervisors dont give eye contact. Hispanic workers/lighter workers can do as they please. They basically run it. Your voice will never be heard. You will not be doing whats in job description. Janitors dont even clean just sit in break room all day. Too many people piled at once to work only 8 tables and 50 something employees. Good pay not worth the stress. Security will jump on you if u "
bad,"I hate the fact that everything is manger’s discretion. What is the point of having advice and counsel and corporate if the manager decides everything. And the store manager does a whole lot of favoritism, and does not give or show thanks to the employees that goes above and beyond for the store/company."
bad,Unless you want to work all the time and still not get done CVS is not the job for you. I worked 25 years and it only took one bad boss to throw it all out the window. I was paid well but had to take a lot of under performing stores to get my salary up. It’s a young mans job. And your not getting promoted unless your a pharmacist.
bad,"Store managers work 65+ hrs, I worked 75+, yet my job never ends. Store Managers receives delivery truck to pack out mdse on shelves, no budget hours! DM talks and write up all Store Managers for every little thing. Write ups are very common part of SM."
bad,"The company is unprofessional, dis-organized and dis-functional.Upon my return from maternity leave i was sent to a store 30-40 minutes away from where i lived and i originally applied at. my schedule was changed several times. there is no work life balance. The company comes first they do not care about their management or employees. which is why they have so munch turnover. for example within one town they have three stores with no store manager just people covering."
bad,"I have never worked more than 40 hours a week until this job. I hardly see my family. It's always about the numbers and bottom line. Very strict. Standards are different with each manager even though multiple mangers per department doing the same thing. If you aren't a favorite, you don't go anywhere. You are undervalued and overworked."
bad,"I left this company because they had poor management."
bad,"1800+ prescription weekly"
bad,"Where do even begin, I gave this company my heart and soul, and never was complimented on any of my duties performed. Co workers of mine (in multiple stores were promoted and held on a pedestal for sleeping with managers, DISTRICT MANAGERS, And the head of loss prevention."
bad,I had a long career there but they changed the culture over the 17 years I worked there.  Benefits got worse and they got bigger and merged with other companies.
bad,"Paid slave basically, they dont care about you having a life outside of work and upper store managers never do anything about issues. Everyone is lazy and never on time, young people expected to make up for the old people they refuse to let go of."
bad,The management is unfair. You have to buy them food or etc. to get a perminent working section. The managers go out and flirt with female workers. They falseafie production time for the lady workers who give in to their flirting ways.
bad,"No breaks, not enough support staff. High workload and demands . Inability to perform well due to continuously being short handed .    lots of emphasis placed on numbers vs. quality"
bad,"CVS will be your life and if sales are hurting one year, you're gone. Your boss has unrealistic expectations and his job is never secure and he brings that right on through down the chain of command. There is no amount of money that will make this position worth it,"
bad,"When I worked for CVS sometimes I was required to clock out for a break but had to continue working. Also management lacked empathy, I was required to do my work plus the other managers in a limited time frame plus give myself and cashiers a break it was very stressful and painful from all of the physical work. When I explained my frustration with my boss and told her sometimes I couldn’t walk after a shift she just said take aspirin. No one else got it as bad as I did once she saw how hard of a worker I was. Reporting her to HR didn’t help either, sometimes I was so stressed out during my shifts I would have to call the company therapist just to calm myself down. Once I left and got another job she went behind all of the other employees backs and tried to pay me 15 an hr to stay, of course I said no. It was horrible. Don’t ever work at CVS!!!!!"
bad,"Management, when working from a location not at the center of the major operation (e.g. a satellite department), tends to be out of touch and very unsuccessful in resolving any issues.  ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease"" is the best metaphor to use, and our concerns were very rarely addressed if at all.  On the plus side, it forced us to engage in creative problem solving on our own, while management continued to take credit for our accomplishments and seemed to do whatever was necessary to make us feel expendable and unfairly compensated compared to our peers in the central locations."
bad,"CVS was a great place to work starting out on my hire date of 2013. However the past 2 years things have changed greatly. Constant hour cuts cause issues meeting customer expectations in the front store and especially at the pharmacy. You have no more than 2 employees working in the front at a time except on truck day and sometimes this is the case for pharmacy staff as well. Whenever there is a customer waiting at pick-up, one waiting at drop-off, one waiting in the drive-thru, and the phone has three people on hold and there is only a pharmacist and one technician on duty I consider this a problem. CVS is a greedy company willing to sacrifice the wellbeing of their own employees in an effort to do more with less that only results in unnecessary stress for all parties. Let's not forget you'll have to work on holidays, and I mean ALL holidays! Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, you name it you'll be there. All the while asking or as I like to say harassing customers if they would like to update an email address, mobile phone number, recieve text alerts, make a donation, sign-up for CVS carepass, get a flu shot, recieve a digital or paper receipt, all of this nonsense while someone is just trying to buy a pack of gum. Do yourself a favor never step foot in this place. Your family will thank you and your mental health will thank you."
bad,"The company is constantly rolling out new programs and initiatives from corporate that are short-sighted and poorly thought out. During my time there they blew millions upon millions of dollars on the stupidest ideas. The only thing they had in common was how rushed and untested they were. They recently decided to install self-checkouts without taking into consideration the demographics of individual stores. My store was rural with a largely computer illiterate elderly population. Customers flat out refused to use the checkouts, stopped coming to the store, and destroyed us on customer surveys. At the same time, they drastically cut hours, meaning that for certain times of day, a single employee is responsible for the entire front store."
bad,Long hours little pay. Worst part of job was bosses! They think they know all and one was very racist. Company does not acre about their employees and everyone is replaceable no matter your experience. They are always changing the rules to get away with anything. I would not work there again!
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone, just a yankee socialist company. Employees are actually referred to as comrades. Things were great in the beginning, but a time went on the ‘programs’ got more and more ridiculous. Everything was the fault of the store level personnel, never the corporate bean counters who had no idea what goes on in a store from day to day"
bad,when I first started about 18 it years ago it was a good and fun job. over the years however the company became more greedy and kept cutting hours and increasing work load and responsibilities.
bad,If you're looking for some side cash . Sure apply but it all depends on the manager on how the store is gonna be run. Some of them are lazy and dont know what they're doing and some do but are rude and racist. People steal all day and you can't do anything about it. Which is annoying because we lose hours when people steal because the company needs more money to protect the loss  than to give employees hours. And the hours are never consistent so your paycheck will flip and flop. I reccomend kids in school to do it or if you're looking to  stay there for years to move up in management. But not as a career its exhausting getting paid so little to do SO MUCH.
bad,"Store managers work 60+ hrs, I worked 70+, yet my job never ends. Store Managers receives delivery truck to pack out mdse on shelves, no budget hours!"
bad,The most wonderful part of my job was meeting different people throughout my customer affiliation! I enjoyed meeting and greeting and helping the customers as they enter the store! I just wish that the head pharmacist and lead technicians would’ve been more honest and biased in assisting other technicians.
bad,"For the first 5 yrs it was awesome; but it was still Longs.  After CVS took over it went downhill.  They instituted a healthcare program; we were to go to their doctors; recording weight and other (I considered private) health issues , I was very confident with my primary care doctor.  He also forwarded all pertinent information that CVS requested.  At that time CVS stated they had not received the required information, although I had fax confirmations!  I was penalized by deducting fifty dollars per month from my paycheck.  I did go to their doctors, I did what they seemed to require.  But they did what they did no matter what I did to try to comply.  I'm so glad that I left the company, even though it was under duress!"
bad,"Too much work ! Too Little recognition ! , district managers don’t care as they making the money. "
bad,"Cvs is constantly making payroll cuts. Management(salary) Work more than 70 hrs a week due to payroll cuts. They give you 2 days to put up 10-13 pallet truck. They never give you enough time to complete planograms. They dont give you the help you need for pharmacy especially when cvs buys out an independent pharmacy. Upper management(district and regional) do not interact within the stores so you never really know what goes on with your employees. They are so based on ""numbers"". They dont allow enough training. Instead of hiring some people with experience or promote within they prefer to hire someone who has never worked pharmacy. There is no advancement for front store once you pass store manager. District leader os usually meant for a pharmacist.Also they do not listen to both sides when it comes to a customer survey. Its always the customer is always right... That is not always the case. Especially when you have audio and visual proof."
bad,"Literally being exposed to hundreds of sick people a day causes sickness, but that doesnt seem to matter. They will penalize you for being sick, but you also accrue trouble for staying home for being sick."
bad,I don't think CVS listens to employees nor do they communicate well what they want done . A lot of what I know I learn on the run not through training.
bad,"I would never recommend this job to any soul. The leadership, QA, and entire training is a complete joke with no knowledge of their role or staffs work. Constant mishandling of their staff.Majority of the knowledgeable staff has either left or are planning to leave."
bad,"CVS has good pay and benefits for a retail job. They also have huge turnover in management and staff employees. The fact that they pay well and can't keep their employees tells you everything you need to know about them. Extremely understaffed, horrible company culture and incompetent upper management are just some of the many reasons why this company is a bad place to work. If all that matters to you is earning a decent paycheck, then I would recommend, otherwise strongly avoid."
bad,"This company is cheap and the upper management are either ignorant or straight up malicious if they think giving us not enough hours to do our basic jobs is our own fault for not ""managing our time properly."" Do not work for them if you can help it."
bad,"It was very hard to work for CVS considering I had previously worked at other places.  It is an extremely hard atmosphere to work no matter how hard you tried. The culture can be described as slave/ sweat shop type deal. They cut hours, cut technician hours and do not appreciate staff working for them. As professionally as one could be, this place makes it very had to be loyal. How can my car be broken into while at work, my belongings stolen ( whole purse with credit cards)and I could not get an unpaid day off to go to dmv to obtain a new one? Like I said earlier, it's almost impossible to be loyal to CVS."
bad,CVS is an extremely challenging place to work at. Pharmacists are constantly struggling to keep the workflow smooth at the same time keeping patient safety in mind. It's a very busy and demanding place to work for.
bad,just don't work here.  I cannot stress enough how poorly they treat their employees at all levels.  New hires are more at less at gunpoint to be transferred around.
bad,Hours are constantly cut. Extremely stressful.  No regard for talent or patient safety. Constant worry about how many hours you’ll get scheduled often having to work 6 days a week just to get 30 hours to keep your much needed benefits. It’s sickening.
bad,"My experience at CVS was very negative. Leadership would never admit that they made a mistake and would go to great lengths to cover up or flat out ignore issues. Work life balance was poor, the pay was not nearly enough for the stress and demanding schedule of the job. The right people were not held accountable. If you are offered an opportunity within the company and you accept, other stakeholders still have to approve you moving to a new role and you run a legitimate risk that they delay your transition."
bad,"No work life balance. Mangers leave when they want, even on snow days. They don't care about anyone there. Old systems, always changing something without consulting the ones using it."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work. Now it's full of people who care more about money than people. Staff feel overworked and underutilized at the same time. Workers are dispensable and you will be quickly replaced. With deaths or serious illness, nobody cares except workers at your location. Benefits have gone downhill along with the morale."
bad,This company takes pride in its business but does not take pride in its workers. There are very few opportunities for advancement. They don't recognize hard word. Any little thing you do that may be a mistake they will let you go even if you worked there for fifty years. They are unfair and don't care about your personal life. They don't give enough paid sick time or unpaid sick time. I do not recommend working here at all. Management at times don't know what they are doing. The atmosphere is just blah.
bad,"Zero onboarding or training, had 3 different directors in less than a year. Was expected to be available 24/7, even during PTO. Senior management very poor. Constant meetings but no follow through."
bad,"After being employed there for about 6-7 months i applied for the shift manager position..which i was then trained for. However the pay was absolutely horrible..to be responsible for all the money , and employees 9.83 was a slap in my face"
bad,I hated this place soo much. they under paid me and the rise at most I ever saw was like 20 cents. under staffed with no hours. their full time is only 24 hours. we where losing customers and our bosses boss said I know you need hours and staff... I'm not going to give you that. you're going to lose customers then your going to hit a point were you're able to handle it and people are going to come back because of how good you're doing.....I had to work 3 to 4 other store just to get 40 hours when I was hired as full time
bad,"The management there as if they don’t care but the team.  "
bad,"The job itself isnt bad. Management is a joke. Supervisors, for the most part, will come up with an excuse for anything/everything. It sucks not knowing when I'll be out for the day until 3 hours into my shift. This is definitely not a good place overall."
bad,"The problem it is retail pharmacy, and the higher ups only care how many customers you have. Many times we tried to ban people that threatened us or treated us poorly, but the area manger would let them come back. As I said the people I worked were great, but between hour cuts, more pressure to do flu shots, and poor raises this company turns over pharmacy technicians like nobodies business. All in all it's alright first job benefits are decent, but I had no incentive to stay there (no growth really in position/overworked with lowest pay possible)."
bad,For the two years spent at CVS the management was poor and could not seem to get it together but the benefits they provided were very good compared to most places in the surrounding areas.
bad,I never cared for CVS.  Not a great place to work when you are trying to raise a family.  The hours you worked changed every day.  Hard to get family thing s done
bad,Before it was CVS health it was Omnicare and I enjoyed my job but once CVS took over I no longer enjoyed my job. Upper management changed and it the company went down hill. They wanted us to do more work and not increase our pay. Our schedules were constantly changing at a moments notice.
bad,"As a Grievance/Resolution Analyst during the busy season it sucks.  The standard tenure rate here is approximately 6 months with ""senior"" people only having been there a year, and 90%+ of people leaving the department within 3 years.  The work itself isn't terrible, but the deadlines micromanagement and constant looming deadlines are.  Those along with the culture of people consistently leaving proves to be a real blow to morale for the department making it harder to form any long lasting or meaningful relationships."
bad,"You login to start taking calls. You may come across a caller that was very irate and would ask for a supervisor. My supervisor would not take the call. She would instruct you on what to say. Their policy was if the caller asked for a supervisor, they were to take the call. She never would. I learned a lot about claims and pharmacy/claims process, which was interesting. The culture was very sit at your desk and work. No talking. Take your breaks, be back on time. No team building went on at all. This job was fairly easy. Nothing too hard about it. The most enjoyable part of this job was the training process. you knew exactly what you were doing when training was over. They did a great job of training you for this position. Their system was very user friendly."
bad,"Horrible management! By far the worst company that I’ve ever worked for. Too many changes in the details on how the work should be performed, they prefer QUANTITY over QUALITY work so you would fit right in if you’re wrong & strong. No consistency in employees, quick turn over. Management needs managerial training ASAP! Started off with 20+ employees in the COE there are about 10/12 now including the ones from home. When you see CVS Health - Plainview... head for the hills! 🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏽‍♀️"
bad,"No collabetation with employees,  poor training and the raises don’t even cover cost of living.  Management get bonuses but not hourly employees.  The worker bees can make or break your bottom line."
bad,"A typical day was you come scan in then scan totes and pick the item put in the tote and eithe pass it to the next perso  or put it on the belt."
bad,It was expected of most everyone to take laptops home on nights and weekends and VACATIONS.  All the while with no clear strategy on goals and objectives - and what little was given would change every two months with no notice and no communication.  Terrible place to be with management more interested in self preservation than growing their teams.
bad,"This company over a short period of time will inevitably drain your moral. Leadership does not seem too know what there doing, making knee jerk decissions. Working for this copmany feels like being on a roller coaster everyday. If you love the holidays forget about it, there open every holiday, no work life balance but only for upper management. Training is lack luster and veg.  Front end merchandiser type of personalities need not apply, you will not last long because they don't care how there store looks."
bad,It was slow all the time and workers kind of sucked but the best part was customer interaction but they started to stick me in the back so i got less and less of that overtime.
bad,"You can only advance if you are friends or related to the people in position of power.  No matter how hard you work or how loyal you have been, you will not advance with favoritism.  I work too hard and am too loyal to be overlooked, bypassed and ignored because I focus on work and not on making friends."
bad,"most employees are overworked and underpaid."
bad,do not get stuck at cvs. not good for a career. cap put pay is short. no room for advancement. almost everyone hates their job at cvs. i wish i had the opportunity to leave sooner.
bad,The corporation cares about nothing but profits. Pay is inadequate. We are expected to do way more work than we have time & staff for. Stress levels ate through the roof.
bad,"While working at CVS, you are constantly being given a numerical score on every metric imaginable, and sometimes given unreasonable goals for how high your numbers need to be for a particular metric. Due to this, the general feeling of employment is a ""cogs in a machine"" feeling."
bad,not interested in writing a reveiw. But since i can't go no further without writing something. walgreen was a nice place to work. But management was the absolute worse
bad,"We as techs already have enough to do. The management could be better. People are lazy in what they do sometimes especially the Pharmacist. We do not get enough hours to even stay working there. The hours we do have always end up bringing someone else in and they get the hours rather that spread the hours among us. I feel like we were there first and should be able to get the hours first. I feel like there is some favoritism going on and that is not fair to all of us.  CVS is just a mess.  Hopefully they are not all that way. I feel like for the work that we do we should have more raises. They say that there is a chance for advancement, but not really. CVS only care about the money and not too much about the people or the employees."
bad,"my store and pharmacy managers were great. however the district pharmacy and store managers were destable. CVS is the lowest paid pharmacy chain for techians, that I'm aware of.  Day to day work was normal and fine until customers and coworkers and then disctrict managers were unfriendly to the lgbtq life style I'm part of. Everyone kept their personal lives so secret is was alarming.  It didn't help teamwork or moral.  I felt awkward there often."
bad,"I worked for 2 different stores as a beauty consultant. Both stores had rude store managers that did not care for your needs. This position can get painfully boring. You eventually just become a customer service associate for the entire store or security to make sure no is stealing in your department. A lot of days you end up not even doing anything beauty related. You get almost no support, I attended one BC meeting in my time there and learned nothing new. The online training doesn't teach anything useful, a lot of the learning is on you. A lot of the focus is on numbers and budget. The pay was ok, definitely nothing you can live off of. But not even worth how boring it can get. Easily the worst job I've ever had."
bad,Not the place to work if you have a growing family you will never see them Omnicare is very demanding of your time. I have requested for a different shift the entire time I've been employed and its always the same story on how something will come available but yet never does.
bad,Very fast paced and interesting place work for. Never dull moment. Always something new to learn or experience.Enjoy working with people and love to help people.
bad,Underpaid employees. Lead techs think they own the territory and they don't do a thing just on their phones etc. Very fast paid no overtime. PCQ calls is basically calling people on the weekend to bug them and force them to fill meds.
bad,"I would rather not say at this time.  All I can say is that management lied, was incompetent and could not be trusted.  As promotions were given the egos became greater and it was not a good working environment."
bad,"I would work long days. I would trade from station to station to learn all the roles of typing, counting and many other things Insurance companies , phone calls and millions of customers."
bad,i started working at cvs when i was a freshman in college it was the most stressful job. i was a photo technician and the machines would always break down when i had tons of photo order due. customers were never happy to come by and their photos wouldnt be ready till days later even though we advertised 1 hour photo.
bad,Working with the CVS company wasn't all that bad. I think the job overall needs to improve with focusing on their staff more. My favorite thing of all time while working there was definitely interacting with the customers.
bad,"Honestly, If it wasn't for my supervisor and immediate employee's, I would have left a long time ago.  Staff is underpaid, overworked, and it shows in their patient interactions."
bad,"Terrible treat their professionals like they are nothing"
bad,"Most days at work were so obnoxiously filled with changing displays that had been put up according to guidelines that ONE person was available to customers on a good day. The store I personally worked at was NOT built to any of the existing floor plan guidelines sent to us for each holiday so, inevitably, EVERY single one of our displays was not exact. This meant every holiday we had visits from corporate higher ups demanding why we do not do as instructed, all the while they are standing on the floor that does not match a single plan in their booklet."
bad,"Used to love my job when it was a small store, then they combined two stores into one big one. People were treated with respect and also treated like they mattered. I was always taught to cater to the customer and once the two stores merged people were treated nothing as such. Its all about the numbers and scores and report cards. I realize you have a business to run but when it comes time to health care a little more patient care is needed and recommended. People want to feel like they matter, not hurried along, they want a little personalization."
bad,"The legal department is a vortex of insecurity, lack of professionalism and tons of jealousy and pettiness. The bar has been set so low by the department manager that anyone who comes in with just an ounce of professionalism or talent is immediately hailed as a hero by the attorneys but seen as a threat by grandfathered management and unmotivated employees! The attorneys and executives are nice and down to earth but they have no clue as to the racism, sexism and bad culture that middle management allows to go on. Nobody cares enough about employee morale. I would not recommend a job in this department to anyone."
bad,Overall you make it the best and do it from the heart . and work hard great team player. You will be successful the work is great . you can learn alot and grow .
bad,"Management is usually hard on you, Even though it is an easy job, management makes it hard and stressful on you because corporate and DM usually comes down on store managers."
bad,CVS just needs to treat their employees better. It is a very unfair company. I take a lot of responsibility being lead tech and i get paid less then almost all of my employees.
bad,Worked as cashier/ CSR and really enjoyed the job. Had alot of good repeat customers and great co workers. Only down side to the job was the pay was not enough for the job.
bad,"CVS is very driven by numbers.Many businesses are.They take pride in high customer service scores but changes in recent procedures actually contradict that."
bad,"I had prior reviewed this as a pharmacist however, my experience as a graduate intern seemed to be lacking the aspects of interning.  The   management had neglected to finish or even start most of my onboarding and training."
bad,Used to be better before they started to answer to wall street. Never worked for any company that set you up for less success then here
bad,"I went to work at Omnicare with a full understanding that I would be a staff pharmacist only."
bad,A typical day is trying to make sure no one hit you while they are driving their equipment. The management team is clueless because they are so busy watching the women who walk around in leggings and a thin shirt. I learned that the floors have not been cleaned in over eight to ten years. There is no communication between the team members and management because they expect you to read a piece of paper that was posted on a broad.
bad,"Only worked here for a couple of months because as the title of the review says, management is awful! Spoken to like you are something they have stood in, inability to correctly print your weeks rota and when you pull them up on it its made out to be you in the wrong! Avoid this particular branch of this company like the plague unless you want to feel belittled on a daily basis. The amount of staff who have also left in the short time I worked there speaks for itself."
bad,"I was an intake technician and worked for about 6 months and I am very happy I'm no longer with this company!!! My manager was so unprofessional and showed too much favoritism. Constantly on her phone having personal, inappropriate conversations. Her boss had no clue about our side of the department and was no help when my manager was absent. And not to mention my 6 months of being there I was never fully trained on my job but was told to help a new hire about 3 months in. You're basically a warm body, they could care less if you actually do your job correctly, this place is a circus!! Go to as many interviews as you can before you accept a job offer from them!!!"
bad,"the warehouse is over filled with salvage and unracked merchandise. "
bad,"processing prescriptions"
bad,Poor customer service training for handle of important medication for patients. Very bad management and support for employees. Poor supervison and bad choice of employees to represent the company.
bad,"A typical day at work is looking forward to going into to work and starting your day with all your eager co-workers. Workflow was hefty some days, but manageable, sometimes a bit chaotic when switching from one task to the next, when one department is short, but always keeps you on your toes. Management is always approachable and realistic in the goals that are set for the employees. The best part of the job is working with a great group of people who are always willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part is leaving your job after 4 1/2 years and starting over."
bad,"I learned that the management can turn on you in a second.  I wouldn't recommend this workplace to anyone.  Absolutely a ""What have you done for me lately"" attitude."
bad,"unloaded truck "
bad,I did not like working here. They cheated me on my hours. They lied to me on many occasions about my future within the cooperation.
bad,"At CVS, you're expected to rearrange your entire life around their schedule. They can change your schedule and 15 minutes later, call you and ask you ""Why aren't you here yet"" and when you check the time index on the newly printed sheet? You see it was actually rewritten 15 minutes ago"
bad,"Never have I experienced a more toxic work environment.  The Troy, MI Specialty Pharmacy is a fear based work place where people are shut down when they try to express new ideas.  Favoritism is the name of the game; if the management likes you, you are able to do no wrong.  However, if they find some reason to dislike you, you can do nothing right.  Be careful though, many an employee has quickly gone from favored to not.  The work would otherwise be pleasant, but it is severely tarnished by poor management.  I would most definitely NOT recommend working here!"
bad,"CVS warehouse is very unprofessional, inconsiderate,selfish, rude, unappreciative. They don't care of you have a life outside the warehouse. They just care about getting their merchandise shipped out. I wouldn't suggest this job to my WOREST ENEMY"
bad,"If you want to wonder what happened to you're life, this is the company for you."
bad,"This a group of miserable people with the exception of the office manager, Nurse support specialist and shipping manager. Everyone (ESPECIALLY Pharmacy staff) are sad and angry people. This company has a HIGH turnover rate for the pharmacy staff because of the harsh nature of that staff. I have worked in healthcare for over 12 years and huge part of that was retail pharmacy and it didn't even come close to how horrible my experience was. The sad thing is it had nothing to do with the workload it was all the hostile atmosphere from the shameless female coworkers who are spiteful and jealous despite the older age they act like 15yr high school girls. So if you are young and especially attractive they WILL bully you."
bad,Company is very disorganized and change their policy and procedures on a daily basis.
bad,come in work and leave. it is an ok place to work. i wouldn't try to make a career out of it though.
bad,"you work like a slave with increasing budget cuts, stressful work conditions and lack of management sympathy or help"
bad,"Supervisors concentrate on making themselves look good and try to find mistakes in your work even if they have to stretch the truth. Very degrading and demoralizing. Because Coram has such an awful reputation in the infusion industry, do your time here and move on.This is the worst company in this industry, so whatever you do in the future has got to be better than Coram!"
bad,"Handle all customer relations issues in accordance with company policy,React to potential shoplifters following company guidelines"
bad,CVS gives you the bare minimum hours to run your store and upper management offers no support. In order for your store to run you have to put well above the 45 mandatory hours per week and still receive no recognition for your work.
bad,Since the beginning of the year they have been slashing tech hours and there’s not enough help for the pharmacist. I am currently job shopping because the work environment is so horrendous but I love my coworkers so it’s a hard but necessary move.
bad,"Stressful place to work,most pharmacists go in early and stay late (for free) to complete work. Management aware not to concerned people are breaking law by working over 12 hour shifts regularly. Techs stay late but don’t get paid.very hostile work environment. The impotent board of pharmacy does not want to get involved evens though it’s a consumer protection agency.this work I"
bad,CVS has cut all tech hours back and continues to make cuts in oder to save money. It's an extremely stressful work environment with never having enough staff to correctly care for their patients.
bad,Nothing good about this place of work.    The culture is awful.   They keep try to use me to call the ethics line on people they don’t like.   Every time when thing doesn’t go well.    They want me to turn in someone at work and blame on each other’s.    I so tire of the back stabling from so call good worker.  They pay salary 40 base.    Trust me they will not happy unless u work extra 20 hours no pay pay
bad,"After 16 years your job is not secure, the training In the front store is horrible,  the staff is a skeleton crew and are expected to do full crew work.  People use to know your name, now you are a number and a statistic.  Not a good place to work.  And not to mention that if you get hurt at work you are on your own, CVS will NOT support you!!!"
bad,This company cares only about the bottom line and metrics metrics metrics galore. No life work balance for management at all. Horrible stressful conditions to work under.
bad,Management has favoritism and has not experience at all promised things that never accomplished  lots of  gossip people walking around doing nothing just talking same thing with the supervisor
bad,"Often work with little or no help. Management often said ""do more with less."" There was always a high turnover in management. I had four supervisors in five years. We often had to work on our days off just to get close to caught up. The stress was not worth the money."
bad,"Cvs is a good place to start out if you are needing ojt or just breaking into the pharmacy world, but if you want to advance in your pay and career you will have to seek a technician job elsewhere"
bad,I would not recommend working for them.  Management is terrible.  Employees are treated like cattle.  Unethical behavior from the top.  Raises are only given to managers friends.  HR is manipulative and will go after anyone they do not like.
bad,Ok place to work. Pay is ok but you have to help unload truck every week when it comes in so if you are older with a bad back this is not the job for you.
bad,Position seemed very promising at the start. The company lacks organization and training to say the least. Was hired for one position and started out doing stuff that was above my pay grade. People receive brief training and then are held to high expectations. You get coached for every little thing you do wrong.
bad,"Worst place I’ve EVER worked!! I was supposed to be part time, but helped out whenever I could ended up being full time, which I’m not complaining about, however;   I received zero acknowledgement from managers. All of them tried to sabotage my employment there and made my life awful while working there!! I was literally the ONLY one during the shift that ran the register for 8 hours straight.. was told I needed to clock out for my paid 15 minute breaks, was told when I could even take a lunch. Harassed by the manager every single work shift. I was left on the floor alone my entire shift and not trained on anything, and when I had questions especially my first week, I was told by the manager “I’m not here” meaning that I just had to figure it out, which I did but I could never get anyone by a page through the store. Threatened a write up almost every shift for anything. I had  to forge documents on her end stating I was at the team meeting, even though I was never involved in the group texts , Christmas parties, thanksgiving party. I conveniently wasn’t invited.  was a living nightmare."
bad,"All Cvs pharmacies are cutting down on hours so working is miserable. Especially, if it’s a busy store. Corporate only cares about money and not about any of the employees. If you want to be miserable, work for Cvs."
bad,Honestly in this market a job is hard to come by especially a high paying job however a company should not leverage market saturation with unachievable expectations and no help.
bad,"They suck, it's all about numbers and not people. Under staffed so even with a drs. note they say they will fire you for not coming in. Employees talk behind your back and will act as if they are better then you.  Really bad working environment."
bad,"Where to begin.  I started at minimum wage,  and stayed there for a year. I never had 40 hours.  The benefits are terrible. Really,  I felt undervalued as an employee. It's a depressing place to work."
bad,"When informed of the position I was told it was first shift and I wouldn't have to work holidays. That is not the case, your expected to work every holiday and once my contract ended they forced me into second shift. While they do hire internally, they pay you more if you come from outside."
bad,"Let me just start off by saying that my direct supervisor, colleagues & all of the people that I supported were absolutely amazing. CVS as a company as filled with extremely unethical people, people that make me understand why the terrorists are so successful, if I could give them a lower rating, I would. My boss, fellow employees and everyone that I support, absolutely love me. Apparently, someone in CVS decided to pull my name out of a hat & crucify me. They took my laptop on a Friday & claimed that my computer had some software that was ""unauthorized,"" they said they would take 1-3 days to see if they could see the reason & based on their results, they would either keep me or let me go. They shipped it out the following Monday. Tuesday evening they said they could not find anything but they were going to continue there investigation. On that Friday afternoon, they said that they still could not find anything but they still terminated me anyways. I was never even given a chance to defend myself, something even the biggest criminals in the world even gets the opportunity to do. The worst part about all of this is that even though I have been proven innocent, the agency that got me this job cannot get me into another position because they will not stop the investigation even though they fired me. This has to be one of the worst, most hypocritical people I have ever met, they claim to have fired me because I was ""unethical"" but there of zero ethics in the way that they conduct themselves."
bad,"Any time you need help from a supervisor, they never help or tell you to ask your assigned manager. Organization sucks, different levels of the company never do their job so you're stuck doing all the work and not being compensated for it. The people are nice to be around but trust and believe they will sell you out fast. CVS HR department is probably the most incompetent Human Resource team I've ever dealt with. They hardly respond and when you get an answer it's never straight forward"
bad,"Was not impressed with CVS.  They put way too much work on employees, also I was a cashier and was not allowed to count my own drawer at beginning or end of shift a manager did that.  If there were any discrepancies they would address it during your next shift"
bad,"If you are from tech or analytics background, i would not recommend CVS:-"
bad,I have worked in retail for over 10 years and I find that CVS is the worst retail company I have worked for. From unhealthy working conditions (i.e both physical and mentally) to constant cut hours in an entire district. Employees are over worked and under paid. I do not feel heard in this company nor do my requests or complaints get addressed. My primary management team (store manager and pharmacy manager) are delightful to work with. The upper management try to bully and coheres negativity. The only positive thing about working at CVS is that they helped me get my CPHT certification by paying for the exam. I would not recommend anyone work for this company.
bad,"Co workers and direct supervisors are outstanding. The job itself is something I enjoy and am good at.  "
bad,Management is for management not for the people beneath them. They don't listen.  No life work balance.  They expect you to still answer your phone on your days off and vacations as well no break.
bad,"I love the job presented by cvs including helping guests, processing claims, and resolving guest relations issues. However CVS has started cutting hours and making claims processing unsafe. the CEO and Boards mentality is that prescription meds should be a fast food  atmosphere instead of managing medications in a safe environment. Target was a much better employer."
bad,Management will scream in your face for no reason and if you say something you get screamed at more. I told my manager I didn’t like the way he spoke to me it was nasty and he began screaming at the top of his lungs
bad,"I trained at a nice store with management that worked with you and had a good time. Once I was out of the training and placed in an assistant manager role until there was a store manager was available, everything change. The store I was sent to was in a bad area of town. The manager in charge of the store did not work well with other."
bad,"understaffed and overworked. you spend 8 hours apologizing that customer's medication isn't ready and they will be angry (rightfully so, who wants to wait 30 mins when you're sick??), so get prepared to be yelled at all day. my manager was great but the district people do not care about supporting us and would rather not give us more hours to work with."
bad,"Cvs is great for young college kids looking for flexible hours. Don’t get me wrong if you want to make a living with CVS you can! Just know you will be busting your butt to get seen and noticed! Most managers at CVS are either rude and don’t really stay at the store with you. They always work mornings and seem not to care what employees really have to do. Some managers are really great to work for which is like a really small diamond found in a box full of needles (really small)... "
bad,"You are ranked by how fast you stock and pick products. i am extremely competitive (especially when there is no other option to do so), so I always ranked over 102% daily. I did not realize that the higher you score, you get in trouble the next day for being ""the same"" or lower. I was penalized constantly for ""only"" getting 107% some days, which means literally running as fast as I could 9 hours a day on steel grates with terrible lighting and no windows in a warehouse/."
bad,"What I learned at Coram! The managers run the show. They only promote who they like! Lack of ethics, morals, and a horrible company to work for in Rancho Cordova that is!"
bad,"This should be an easy job with good benefits and easy hours, however, the lack of any real management makes the smallest of tasks next to impossible to get done when your coworkers are chronically late to work and leave their work for you to do. "
bad,"Overworked, not enough help. Manager didn't offer assistance. Poor workplace moral. Too many quotas/metrics to meet. High stress. Had to work many extra hours to get the work done"
bad,I was a third shift full time employee. My direct manager was always accusing me of something but always ended up being proved wrong. I was the youngest one in my department and it made others mad. There was no manager overnight so there was no one to inform of the corruption taking place. You sit at a computer doing repetitive work with no talking. Worst company to work for.
bad,The pay that was promised to me I never received and by the time they started to pay me what was promised I was offered another job.  If you are a manager then this is a decent job.
bad,"My time there as a pharmacist was highly stressful. Between disrespectful technicians, unrealistic workloads, and rude customers who you are forced to pander to in fear of corporate being called, it was a nightmare. Many pharmacists are depressed, burned out, and over worked. The tasks always increase and metrics are idolized. Forget protecting your license, they want numbers and money. If they cared about patient safety (like they claim), the focus would be on patient safety and not scores and how fast the scripts were filled. This is a last resort place to work. The only highlight was money, but they should pay more with all the added stress. You are expected to be a telemarketer (always harassing/calling patients and doctors for more scripts), as opposed to focusing on patient safety. Its sad that other retails are starting to model CVS. They won't give you enough tech help to handle being able to do the things they expect. A score isn't more important than making sure the main part of your job is done accurately. You have to scarf down your lunch in the back of the pharmacy and are constantly interrupted."
bad,"Cvs health gave me new experience in mail order and specialty. Unfortunately doesn't care much for their employees, cares more about numbers overall.."
bad,The first CVS i worked at was horrible. I am now at a new location which is more professional and manageable. My answers above are based off my horrible experience at store 6846
bad,"No training available once you've started the real day to day work. You're asked to not be afraid to ask for help and when you do, there are several different answers and 90% of them are wrong. But you won't know that until after you've spent a day doing it wrong."
bad,"CVS Pharmacy life is terribly stressful and non-stop. There are 100 things to do and only so many people to do them. Corporate CVS cares only about numbers. Everything is a point system. Stores lose points for things that are out of workers' control. Pharmacists are constantly criticized for not making ""the numbers"", yet the stores aren't sufficiently staffed because the pay is not worth it, so all of the qualified people leave with the knowledge that they can prosper elsewhere."
bad,"Even though the PTO is very generous there is no work/life balance,  you are expected to be working all the time even at night otherwise your clients will complain which this is all CVS cares about. Each employee has a different Book of Business and most of the time you have way to many clients to  handle which leads you to working those long 12 hour days. Managers do not listen when you go to them about the workload and just say its the ""busy season"", but this is said year round. Managers do not care about your career and if you are waiting for some guidance on your career from your managers you are going to be waiting forever. Account Managers and Account Executives are under valued and looked at as expendable and this shows in the high turn over that is in both these potions."
bad,"If you would like to work for a company that's all about metrics and not patient health this is the job for you. Your timed on every aspect of the pharmacy including how long it takes to fill a prescription, ring out a customer, answer the phone, and wait on the drive thru. If all these things are not completed in a timely manner you are penalized. Plus they want you to complete all these tasks with a skeleton crew. The turnover rate is terrible, no one is trained correctly, and the pharmacist this company hires are all garbage, especially in the southeast Texas area. They don't care about patient care period- Just drilling you to scan an extra care care for every patient! Which is also a metric."
bad,This is a great place to work if you are just starting out as a pharmacist.  you can learn a lot from starting off working in a chain environment.  The downside is that retail is not designed to retain employees for long periods of time.  My opinion is that you get in for the experience but don't stay too long.
bad,"A typical day involved fast paced multi tasking with little to no breaks.  Management cared more about business metrics than they did for the worker, the patient, or the company in general. That usually meant cheating on a business metric verses actually achieving the metric honestly.  Management engaged in a lot of unproductive, unsubstantiated, unverified gossip. Management often used the power of the position to treat subordinates in a fashion that would not be tolerated if the subordinate acted in a similar fashion.  It was not uncommon for a supervisor to verbally insult an employee in front of a crowd of coworkers."
bad,"we became really short staffed and as being, I was still in high school working almost every day from 3- 10 or 4- 10 was hard. I never had time for school work."
bad,"You will meet some good n some bad coworkers! U have the loners then you have the butt kissers who is always gossiping everyone business with the manager and supervisors. Omnicare management have the highest level of favoritism that I have ever worked. Only the people they hang with outside of work are treated fairly, anything discussed in private with it managers or supervisors are discussed among your colleagues. Just unprofessional all around, manager talk to you like your a child and walk around with face always looking angry. They talk nicely to you but talk the most hateful things behind your back and every shift have so many so called supervisors everyone think they’re in charge just very childish work place!!!"
bad,"Omnicare is an unprofessionally run company. The computer system is still dos based. Moral is non.Excisted,management is very moody and plays favorites."
bad,"What a nightmare!! The people worked with are awesome, gave management 5 stars for my direct in store management. NOT for higher up bosses! PAY is horrible and always understaffed. Go somewhere else!!"
bad,"CVS is a great place to work for pay. However, the quality of life is important. The environment is stressful and the help is minimal as there is a general failure in the industry to retain quality technicians."
bad,They expect you to work under 40hrs with unrealistic goals that have to be met otherwise they are constantly nagging you to do better faster work. It’s all about numbers and metrics. They don’t really care about their staff and want a robot that doesn’t miss even when truly ill or kids sick. With little pay and not enough skilled employees that can get the tasks done in the time given plus help customers and fill prescriptions.
bad,"Worked there a little over 2 years, and only had a few hires. The customers were rude and disrespectful, always short staffed, and they cut hours a lot"
bad,The local management team lacked the skills needed to oversee and maintain a cohesive work environment.  The level of nepotism is one which I had never experienced in any environment and others find it incomprehensible that a company would allow such behavior given the number of HR complaints filed by numerous employees over the years.
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"expect you to do everything in pharmacy with minimal help.  Plenty of times have a numberous amount of baskets/ scripts to check, but have to stop to give a flu shot even though other customers are waiting.  You get the honor of working after your shift for free because work isn't complete.  Also ok for fellow Pharmacist to come to work late with no punishment."
bad,"They are more concerned with following their own rules, not the states or your safety. Never have I seen such a high level of inefficiency within a company and a willingness to perpetuate it."
bad,"I enjoyed working at CVS Distribution center. The work was fast pace but not bad. I liked the different positions.  I didn't like the fact that they treat you like a number. This company lies a lot, it is so weird. I have witnessed a lot over the 6 years. This company was way better when it was Longs."
bad,"The people you meet are wonderful, even when over half of them are sick. The worst part about the job was that it felt like the company didn’t really want you to build a relationship with the patients with the amount of people they try to pump through a single store. We were always understaffed and over worked. On top of that, I had even been through a robbery while working. After that happened, the company didn’t do much to make sure that it wouldn’t happen again. CVS could use a big revamp, but I think the company is already too far gone to pull itself out of the mess."
bad,"I would not recommend CVS pharmacy to anyone. Managers are unprofessional, too many problems to list. Pharmacist writing pain medication for himself, he was let go, then rehired at another location! Another lead technician cussing in front of customers, walking out, and amazingly able to keep her job? Not a professional environment."
bad,Worked here and was not recognized for my hard work. Management hires and retains other family members and also has favoritism with certain employees and cliques. I learned that no matter what you do you will be overlooked and let go.
bad,"the company does not care about it's employees.  the discounts are pretty good.  health care is good, but expensive. you get paid a very small amount of money to do way to much."
bad,Very stressful and no appreciation...upper managment only cares about money not about the patient or employees...work place is not a freindly enviroment
bad,Compensation was poor i did learn how to handle  a team of workers of i was their supervisor. Over the course of my term there i handled a great deal of company funds in a correct matter.
bad,"Training was fun but difficult to learn.  What was taught in training had nothing to do with what the calls were actually about.  False information was given regarding schedules and the clients we were told we'd be dealing with.  Management has little to no involvement once working at home.  Performance metrics are not communicated.  When trying to call other departments for information, you receive no help and get an attitude.  Very ghetto"
bad,"I love my job as a pharmacy tech at Omnicare. The hours are great, most of the employees are also. A couple of the managers are great and listen but never really follow through. On the other hand, a couple of the supervisors feel the need to bittle employees in front of coworkers. I have heard them gossip about other employees, (every day they are talking about SOMEBODY. anybody!) even having open conversation with employees about an absent coworker. "
bad,"A learning experience under the harshest conditions with very little compensation or caring.  Your expected to perform your best, usually understaffed and undervalued.  You could eat lunch and be backed up another 2 or 3 screens of late orders and endless phone calls.  One of the professions best ways to learn but just a little too harsh for most."
bad,"CVS is a good starter job but advancement in the company is limited, compensation is low, and raises are hard to get. Most days are spent managing more tasks than one person could handle."
bad,Worked in a bay area city and got a manager that changes things for the worst.  If you weren't hired by him he basically made your life difficult.  CVS expects more for less.  They cut my full time hours to 25 and expected me to do the same quanitity of work I did in 8 hours. Store manager took over Pharmacy personal and we suffered for it.
bad,It's  good company but right now they are very unorganized but now going through many changes to get more efficient and organized. I think the changes will be good.
bad,This position is for a person who truly loves retail and that was not me. I felt that the management did not do enough to support the pharmacist by providing enough technicians hours in order to run the pharmacy in a way that would provide optimal pharmaceutical care to the customers and patients
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here.  The pay is low for the work that has to be done.  At a last resort, and if walmart isn't hiring I would work at CVS caremark."
bad,"CVS was not a good company to work for, similar to Walgreens. Terrible pay. There was very little that was enjoyable about this job except some of the regular customers."
bad,"Come in start typing prescription, then wait till the second person comes in so they can jump in and help with all that you've been doing. Transfer to another station like filling and do that while you take care of the drive threw, then transfer to another and check patients out. I learned about management and being a team player."
bad,"IT problems that disrupt and delay work do not occur every day; however they occur every week. The problems are recurring and IT department doesn't seem to make an effort to fix the problem. "
bad,"The CVS corp. is too worried about making money to worry about their workers. ""Work Smarter, not Harder"" has led to mass decrease in quality, and poor moral for workers. "
bad,This was the worst job I had in my life. The people are horrible. The pressure is enormous and you are always short staffed. You will be over worked and under paid.
bad,It's not that the job is awful its just that the company and management is horrible. they only advance whoever kisses butt and cheats the best. Its like highschool where you have teams. Management knows nothing about managing a company and seems as though they've never even took management classes. I assumed most either don't have a degree and work their way up shinning their bosses shoes or have a bachelors in another unrelated field. They do not have happy employees. They lie constantly about everything. Everything is manipulation. Just don't like being around negative people daily. The turnover rate is unbelievable which would signify to any other company that maybe they are doing something wrong.
bad,I have worked at three stores which have all had a manager that was very disrespectful. My supervisor at my present store is nothing but rude and degrading. She bullies her employees and treats them like children who are incapable of learning.
bad,"I started with CVS in early August 2015 at store 5236 in Fort Myers Fl. From day one the female store 'Manager' "
bad,Horrible place to work loaded trucks daily with short breaks supervisors didn't want anyone helping  you they basically wanted  you to act as a machine
bad,"not at good company yo work for. Low pay, terrible health benefits. Took 6 months for merit raise to go through and then it was not what my pharmacy manager requested. Lack of communication between management and me. Not a team environment. Typical day - do 14 day return to stock, Print labels, pull stock, scan and fill prescriptions for pharmacist review. Check out at register and drive-thru. Update insurance information when required. Help with processing electronic prescriptions and paper prescriptions at drop off. Contact patients if out of stock or if need insurance information,"
bad,Worked at CVS Health infusion as its called now for only 6 months and was by far the worst IV tech job ever. There is no support or care for the Pharmacy Techs and the Pharmacists just fill and print orders. The location was so understaffed in the Tech side that we always were staying from 8am-9pm sometimes. Management was horrible the only good ones are the lead Pharmacy Techs.
bad,"Worked at this job for 2 years loved what i did and loved the staff i worked with management is horrible! Never enough staff to get what needs done, thinking such a big company could afford to give their employee's what they need to do their job and enough staff since they are all about the customer first. District managers at the Coshocton store should not even be managers they are no help what so ever all they do is criticize for whats not done or about things that are in no ones control, bad numbers in drive thru instead of worrying about their customers getting in and out with the correct medications in a timely manner I cant even count the times that we would have to tell a customer to come back 3 or + times because we could not count out their prescription because there is not enough help. This company or at least the management only worries about them selves worst job I have had! I do not know how many times i did not get my 15 minute breaks because there is not enough staff to cover my spot nor anyone else that works there. Once again i would not recommend this place to anyone this place will mentally scar anyone."
bad,"CVS is a horrible place to work! The everyday tasks they make employees do are time-wasters and the goals they give them to achieve are unattainable. The pharmacist is so busy ringing up people all day that they can't even get their pharmacist duties completed. Not only that, some of the techs there were so impossible to work with (Jenks location) that the pharmacist was having to take up all the slack. Upper management would not handle dealing with the technicians and put all of the responsibility onto the pharmacists, including write-ups and discipline. 14 hour days are the norm, with no breaks...not even to sit down. Store manager did not lift a finger to help the pharmacist (Jenks location) and had a bad attitude to boot. You felt like you couldn't rest for 5 minutes because you had to go right on to the next stupid, unimportant task they made you do."
bad,"A typical day at work ... 600+ prescriptions to fill, countless phone calls to answer ... technician and pharmacist hours always being cut ... a mountain of expectations by supervisors, managers and corporate big shots that on a physical and mental level could never be accomplished. "
bad,"Co-workers very nice to work with, however manager very rude and does not know how to communicate with her co-workers. I do not deserve her to belittle me and I can find a position elsewhere!  Everyone knows everyone in the company and the HR reps know the managers very well. Unable to voice opinion as they all spend time with one another."
bad,"I was hired as a Patient Service Representative at Caremark in Fairfield, NJ, although they called it a Pharmacy Technician position through CSI Recruiting company. Caremark says they will provide you with two weeks of training however, if you do not catch on to their prehistoric DOS software within two days of training they will let you go. The trainer I had moved very fast through the training process. Everyone in the class complained about not understanding the curriculum and no one knew what they were doing. The building is beautiful, big and state of the art. I didn't rate this company well for the most part because they really need to upgrade their computer systems. Trainees will need to  unlearn everything they may already know about current keyboard functions. Before you start your training here Google DOS to become familiar with the system environment. The real Pharmacy Technician's work in the warehouse on this job site. They never sit down. You will be given 1 hour for lunch with two fifteen minute breaks as a PSR. Your schedule can be changed at a moments notice. Be sure when you work with CSI Recruiting that they tell you what your schedule will be. If they just say you need to be flexible that's a red flag that you may be surprised with a night shift once you are hired. Never ever be late. They will fire you. During your first 90 days on the job there can be no tardiness or calling out sick. They will let you go in a snap."
bad,Very unorganized. They aren't as true as they say they are. The work was good but they hype you up with many promises before you start working then nothing happens after you start.
bad,"I worked there as a contract employee, everything was great, no complaints by management,etc.  One day I get a call from the staffing agency saying that I was not to return to work and they were given no explanation why.  If my contract was over CVS should have just told me so a week earlier.  It was very rude of CVS to treat me this way, it has bothered me for many months."
bad,"Enjoyed my daily typical work day"
bad,"I believe this was the worst job I have ever had.  I had to stock, cashier, clean and process photos.  Was expected to put my life on the line to prevent theft.  Worked close to full time but did not receive any benefits.  I saw qualified person get passed up for a shift supervisor position in favor of someone who had started 2 weeks before.  I also witnessed a guy who was not alcohol certified get a prime morning time shift everyday.  I could count the number of times he closed.  I worked there for over a year and I got a 1% pay raise out of a possible 2%.  Terrible!"
bad,"You would think that at a pharmacy of all places, they would care about people.  When my son became critically ill and was in another town two and a half hours away and needed me to be there, I was told this was not an acceptable ""time off"" due to the fact that it was HIS illness and not MINE!  What a joke! Not to mention when I came back not ONE PERSON asked how he was doing!!!  I am so thankful I am NO LONGER working there!  Who wants to work in a place where they don't care about you OR your family?? Granted I had just recently started so maybe it was bad timing..I couldn't qualify for FMLA because I hadn't been there long enough but still I have NEVER worked for a company that is so not understanding of an intense medical situation!!!!! It's OK to work here but don't have anything come up! God forbid!!!!!"
bad,"Lack of education in staff, agents were teaching management. Company and equipment never worked. Sercurity was very rude and dishonest. There is NO job security!"
bad,"My typical day of work was opening up the photo machine, putting away merchandise, helping customers, answering phone calls."
bad,"A typical day at work resembled an assembly line job I once performed. I learned very little due to time restraints, other than what I/we could absorb on our own time. The management, well as I said they were micromanagers and the co-workers were described in many ways by each other, and ranged from poor to great or fantastic! The hardest part of the job was providing good/great customer service in the light of the management parametes implemented and the most enjoyable part of the job was serving our patients when time permitted."
bad,The hours can be great but CVS will cut your hours in a heartbeat as a Pharmacy technician. I went from 40 hours one week to 10 hours the next. The manager tried to help out but could only do so much. The corporate office is the place where they determine how many hours a week techs get.
bad,"I loved my job in 2015 and 2016 but today it’s horrible. There’s never enough technician help, the work load continues to be more and more, and they expect you to do extra things on top of a normal already overwhelming workload."
bad,"You don’t learn much, just tossed in, no proper training, over worked, underpaid, they don’t care about your life out side of cvs or your family, when u sign your paper work it tells you you can’t make any other commitments out side of cvs because it would interfere with work there(no sports, no school, no part time jobs) managers have unrealistic expectations, staff is rude and no one ever wants to work the register or answer the phone. If you get sick and are hospitalized “oh well”"
bad,"management sucks, hours suck, employees suck, customers suck,inadequate training, compensation is not worth the job requirements, and the job is basically set up to make you look incompetent and withstand abuse from custoemrs"
bad,Extremely over worked and under paid! It’s a slave ship disguised as a pharmacy! The expectations of the pharmacist are unrealistic. The pharmacist are not valued.
bad,"Wish I never started to work here. Very stressful and they really push for overtime. Not valued as a person or how you do your job. Doesn't seem to care for patients, just how many orders you can place.  Training is not good."
bad,Unrealistic demands without adjusting manpower that is needed to meet those demands. The people who work for this company are treated like cattle and used as such. The corporation lacks empathy!
bad,"I have worked in the retail industry for over 12 yrs and I can say without a doubt this worst job I had. The Store Manager talks to people like they are a child. The Store manager had all of us running the store while he stayed home, watch us on the cameras and calling every 10mins to do. He would schedule himself to come in at 7 am to relieve the overnight supervisor but would never showed up then call you to come in early."
bad,"The Ac never worked in the summer time. We’d always send a request to get it fixed but turned out CVS  never wanted to send someone out to actually replace the air conditioning unit because when they built the store they put a smaller unit in instead of the proper size for the store. My manager was horrible over the course of 1 year. She never got anything done on time. Doesn’t defend you at all, leaves the store early in her shift, places too much work on the shift supervisors when there’s 2 op supervisors and an op manager who can’t pull their weight around the store. The employees were great. Management was just horrible. I think the store manager got or is too comfortable with her position."
bad,"Due to my experience and tenure with the company I was treated well. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. They expect the Store Managers to work at minimum 60hrs a week salaried. Most managers have to work 70-90 hours to meet the CVS standard. When managers work that much they aren't the friendliest, and they don't last that long. It's definitely not the culture or mission they like to throw around."
bad,"I really liked my pharmacy tech job when I started,  but corporate is changing so many things which has caused me to no longer enjoy my job and want to look for opportunities elsewhere.  Hours are cut to where the ratio of pharmacists to techs is 1:1. Not a good idea when handling medications. Good customer service is highly stressed which is impossible with a ghost crew per shift.  There are too many daily tasks to accomplish throughout the day.  It's overly fast-paced and stressful which is not a healthy working environment. Associates and customers are feeling the unrealistic changes which will eventually cause CVS to lose business and employees. It's really unfortunate that profit trumps customer service and employee treatment."
bad,"CVS provides a lot of benefits from insurance to discounts on popular name brand services but it comes at the cost of a lot of work, stress, and time."
bad,I got Picked on by a few of the management people and nothing was ever done about it by HR. I did not feel safe in the work environment one bit which is why I left the company.
bad,Total disappointed the way management the site many times feel like nothing take care of employees.     Supervisor are not prepared to take care of team and partial
bad,There's not much else to add that hasnt been said above. The company is trying to apply business school philosophy into healthcare by overworking pharmacists and trimming staff. Also they encourage managers to be ruthless and threaten to terminate employees. This model is a ticking time bomb.
bad,Having worked for CVS for 10 years now it’s sad to say the company only seems to get worse for its employees. I am a current pharmacist and the company only seems to find ways of imposing more work on its employees for the least pay possible. I am constantly plagued with cut hours for my technicians who are very necessary to get the job done. It’s a fast paced environment and requires every help needed but you not gonna get that from management. I’m expected to fill 500 prescriptions a day with little to no help and the pharmacist is basically expected to play the role of another technician. That’s CVS’s solution to them not giving hours for technicians. Also techs working for CVS are among the least paid in their field amongst other competitor chains and results in them constantly leaving. Now they expect you to continuously train new personnel to fulfill those roles while still expecting the best customer service experience for their customers. It’s sad I enjoyed working for this company at some point in my career but not so much. Oh and the new grad pharmacists are being offered a lot less money now by CVS when hired and are anxious to replace the ones who have been working in the field and have higher pay and the company seems to love it! They can’t wait to dwindle the salary for pharmacists in the future. Looks like it’s going to be more fun!
bad,"i wouldn't recommend working here unless it was a last choice. I like my job but do not enjoy the favortisim and the lack of organization, communication, and common send."
bad,"Love the work environment, however my hours have been cut to one day a week. So I am currently looking for another job or possibly a second job... The people I work with are probably the best part."
bad,"Pharmacy manager demonstrated blatant discrimination. Broke policy for favorites, but threatened others. Did not, and would not, provide training to new or newer employees, but reprimanded when they didn't know what to do. Ridiculed and degraded employees in front of customers."
bad,I enjoy working in pharmacy however changes to pharmacy have not been great. I have worked retail pharmacy for 6 years. Im interested in taking on other aspects of pharmacy.
bad,"It was an ok place to work for a first time gig as a pharmacy tech. I had a few great coworkers, but the rest were utter lazy trash. Plus I didn't like how the techs in the triage department were segregated by race. If management was smart, they'd integrate workers so that everyone would be on their best behavior and actually do their work as assigned. The workers on the wall were really lazy but the POC were monitored heavily. It should've been reversed because the lazy side took advantage of this fact. Due to their laziness, I developed achilles tendonitis (which at least 4 of us developed while working there because they weren't picking up the slack). Plus there was a LOT of favoritism. Pharmacists were rude and couldn't be bothered to do their jobs when you needed help so I was left to consult pharmaceutical literature most of the time. Pharmacy techs are acquiring more of pharmacists' work for no increase in pay so be prepared for disappointment, stress, & feeling used."
bad,"CVS started out great...however over the years the company changed its priorities. They are one of, if not the number one, company with the lowest paid employees, meanwhile expecting 10x the work. CVS is not the original company it started out as."
bad,"Poor management, scheduling is impossible because the company tries so hard to save money by keeping the pharmacy always understaffed. Workflow is a nightmare, they schedule most people to leave right before the busiest time of the day so it's normally just you against the wave of customers from 5pm until 9pm."
bad,"I do not wish to disclose any information regarding working at this organization. "
bad,Upper-level management is the worst. They change the rules when it suits them. One week you're doing things the way they have told you to do it in the past and the next week that's out the window and you suck for doing it that way in the first place. Store-level management isn't much better in most cases. No one seems willing to take the responsibility to better the team and the store. They do not stand up for their teammates or take blame when things go wrong. They try to throw people under the bus and act shadily and pettily to people they don't care to work with.
bad,"They tell you your full time but really work only 32-36hours there is never enough payroll, everything is timed and micromanaged, your expected to do the work of 3 people alone you dont take breaks just lunch but get in trouble if you don't take it on time, you work off the clock a lot they say they don't allow it but look the other way when it's done trust me you won't get all the work they have you do on the clock you must   meet all metrics or your replaceable the pay is horrible for the stuff you have to deal with the only reason I stayed so long is because my pharmacy manager is awesome and truly would show us his appritiation  the company on the other hand is horrible they can't even get your pay correct had so many payroll issues of not being paid right horrible company and no one can ever give you an answer when it comes to hr questions /problems all they care about are numbers and your always replaceable."
bad,"Customer constantly complain that nothing is ready when they come to pick up. This is true. The reason is that CVS doesn't want to staff the Pharmacy. You are running around a lot but not getting paid fair wages. The Pharmacy Manager is ok but am sick of constantly having to do modules. One I was told needed to be done a month earlier than the due date and was being hassled about it. Despite the mean/angry customers, there are a lot of great people that come in that I genuinely care about. The front store managers are real good. Also, it seems I get stuck at register when it's time for me to go and no one wants to relieve me, that's annoying."
bad,the days work was not the issue it was after you get certified an they dont want to give you the pay increase.  An sometimes the pharmacist are rude an disrespectful
bad,Management in this department is totally unqualified.  management feels you work harder if your job is threatened.  A lot of harassing by supervisor.  Rules and procedures change all the time. No overtime pay.  Expected to work nights and weekends even when nothing is a rush.
bad,days were not scheduled correctly to make sure medications could get filled in a timely manner. fellow coworkers had bad attitudes and judgemental. not enough time to fill prescriptions
bad,"There really isn't much to say. They over work you for little pay. They don't treat you good. They talk to you like you are stupid. That's why they can't keep people. There is definitely a lack of communication there as well. Terrible place to work, but some of the best co workers to work with!"
bad,"Everyday there is great customers who walk in and truthfully I miss them now that I am good. I have to say as much as I loved the customers, the job was emotionally and physically stressful. I am still in high school and they were working me to much. They would keep me after my hours, they would never work with my school schedule until after I put my Two weeks in. I tried to stay as long as I could because we were short staffed. that was another thing, everybody quit, so i do not think it was me. they would also take away your breaks after a few weeks."
bad,"The supervisom isn't okay at alll , they need a little more work in that department. But over all the job is okay , & when we have work the time goes by pretty past ."
bad,"The People I work with nice and the environment in which I work in is excellent. I get great joy with the ability to truly help people on a daily basis. The company and its care the people within is the issue."
bad,"every day was always very busy, always trying to keep up with doing many different things at once.  The people I worked with were very good to work with.  Pay was not very good but the job kept me busy and I worked harder than   many of the younger ones other than that it was a good experience"
bad,"The management at Cram / CVS is not fare to the employees that do good work. They are not a good group of mangers to work for and not trustworthy at all. If you have a issue about something and bring it to there attention the will not address it at all, they will just sweep it under the rug and tell you anything just to get you out there face. But CVS is a good company to work for it just managment that makes if difficult to work for. For the years I have work for Coram / CVS I have never seen a afro american get promoted while working under the branch manager that work for Coram / CVS in Houston."
bad,Every day it is a disaster. CVS is cheap we do more prescriptions then the 24 hr store down the street yet we do not have a overlap pharmacist to help. The 24 hr store down the street has a counting robot to help them and more technician's. Our hrs are limited the higher boss always yells at us because our numbers are low yet they won't give us more hrs or a counting robot to help.
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked. The manager has his picks and is very unfair. Selfish only looking to get a bonus and not caring about the employees. Only the manager and Assistant get 45 hours. Alot of talking behind employees back by the manager.Training is a joke, not enough time to train employees and not enough employees to please the customers. The pay is awful. Work like a slave."
bad,This is a very difficult company to work for. Over worked an often not paid for time spent while working at the store because the pharmacy isn't open.
bad,"Coram was a great company until it was purchased by CVS.  CVS/Caremark insisted on imposing their culture, which focuses more on logistics and cost management rather than personal patient care.  CVS removed a lot of valuable managers and replaced them with incompetent yes-men who know little about how the business really operates, causing even more talent to leave.  The newest president is from Miami and not moving to Denver, which is a pretty good signal that Coram's days as an independent entity are numbered."
bad,"script count is what your hours are based on. our store seemed to be about the same hectic pace yet we weren't somehow meeting our quota which never made sense considering its always busy. long story short, how can anyone live off of 17 hours a week!?"
bad,"You seem to only get more hours if you volunteer to work at other stores all around the metro area. I average no more then 15 hours a week. You cannot make a living off that. I was NOT informed of this when I accepted the job. I said I was expecting 30+ hours if not Full Time and they agreed. They also lost my first paycheck. I went a month without money for bills. HR is awful. They are clearly residents of another country and cannot understand questions you ask. They just repeat the same thing over and over, I assume reading off a computer. "
bad,"Typical work day, come and with your lab coat on. Open pharmacy,print six day and returns report. Start typing prescriptions and fill the prescriptions. Deal with rush hour and kkepp up with the que."
bad,"A typical day at work was often hard to comprehend considering it was not a very stable or set environment. Things were constantly changing daily, never a solid foundation, however, throughout the day we would assist customers with refilling their medications, medication or profile information, contacting doctors for refills. I learned many of the brands and generics by working with them day to day and what they were used for. For working in a call center with over 200 employees working in one large room it can get rather hectic with all the different personalities around. I managed to make the best out of it and was nominated most valuable team player for always lending a helping hand to the new trainee's. The hardest part of the job would be all the constant change, ups and downs, too many premature projects being pushed through on rush, many back fires, the company policies have getting very heavy and unreasonable. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers as much as you can, and seeing that your graciousness paid off."
bad,"Daily tasks include typing prescriptions, answering calls.Translate for customers and pharmacists daily. Verify insurance eligibility. I also completed daily tasks for third party billing. Submit etars. Stock and restock inventory and robot( automatic medication dispenser)"
bad,"managment not willing to teach, wages very poor for the work required even after years of dedication"
bad,Terrible company to work for. They do not care about their employees. Bonuses are garbage.Constantly cut hours to make your job harder and you operate at bare bones minimum. I feel like I’m in a factory meeting a number quota instead of helping patients lead better and healthier lives. Mentally and physically exhausted after every work day. technician Pay is terrible and the technician turnover rate is terrible as well making it so hard to hire quality help.
bad,"Working for CVS for 6 years has shown me that this place will only ever be just a job to me. The company doesn't really care about it's employees, and It feels like a very petty environment depending on which location you work at."
bad,The pharmacy is understaffed at all times.  The company promotes customer service and patient care but does not give the adequate resources to achieve these goals
bad,There are no hours and two people are expected to do the work of 5. Customers are constantly belittling you. Honestly the only thing keeping me here is the good benefits and my amazing coworkers.
bad,I tried my best to work with my employer but it didnt work out I'm disappointed in how everything changed I put all my effort in staying showing them that I am available but since they started to cut hours it was horrible I can't manage to pay bills on 29 hours a week . I tried like I said it didnt work out I'm somewhere where my employer sees my potential and pays much more decent
bad,"Pharmacy management must be required to take a class on how to train, manager, & address their employees in an appropriate fashion. Making an example or confronting a tech infront of co-workers & customers is unacceptable & should not be tolerated under any circumstances. Pharmacists should be required to know how to run each workstation to full capacity. Knowledge is key."
bad,"The store I worked at was not 24-hours, often had to deal with angry customers because the pharmacy closed before the front store and they needed to pick up or fill prescriptions. Associates are forced to offer rewards cards or get written up. Also would get written up for following the policy on coupons, it was often changing and hard to keep up with. As an associate you're always being monitored, feels like they cared more about the cashier taking money than they do about their safety."
bad,"I have been with CVS Health for a couple of years now and all I can say is that it's a lot to handle.  The job itself is a lot to deal with, especially since the store I work at is a high volume store.  There are constantly lines at the front check out, and always have customers complaining.  While there are plenty of negatives from working here, I have had made several connections with my fellow employees and feel as though we are a family.  There's a sense of security while working in the store and everyone seems to have everyone's back when needed.  We work together as a team and I feel as though that is important.  Collaborating with each other and getting tasks accomplished is rather important in this store.  The tasks are stressful, especially if we are shorthanded. "
bad,Would not reccomend  working there . Very stressful and they ask to much of their employees when they are willing to learn . Way understaffed . It was not very bad until I said I was willing to be cross trained which is where i originally started was  front store and eventually advanced  to pharmacy
bad,"This job was so stressful, my coworkers were such pieces of poo and the management and corporate guys were so terrible it literally gave me severe depression. This company is horrible to work for at the store level."
bad,"Stressful environment. Uncomfortable and very unprofessional workplace. Typical work day includes a huge workload, coworkers telling on each other, and constant oversight by the GM micromanaging your work."
bad,A full time position is 30 hours. A part time position is 5 hours. When I ask why the hours are so low management says “ it’s slow time”.. it is never slow.. it is dangerous how fast we have to work taking care of peoples meds. Lots of mistakes get made. Prices are extremely high up front and you have to wait hours for your prescriptions. Why go here at all???
bad,Unfair practices night shift management horrible. Only two 20 minutes break for an 8hr shift 15 minutes if u want to keep productivity up. Cats and other animals roaming around warehouse and cat urine and fecies everywhere
bad,"The work environment is awful unfortunately! The hospitality is very poor. Management is not great either...they don't take time to HELP AND SUPPORT their employees that need help. Instead they get annoyed and snap at you. Which makes asking questions and looking for support really difficult. The treatment of new employees is just awful. Unless your okay with people being rude to you all day long, then that is the place for you."
bad,"After CVS bought the company from Caremark, everything went downhill including the culture.  I was eventually laid off after 20 years employment.  It seems as though they don’t want to keep employees with long tenure."
bad,"A typical work day at CVS is very stressful. What I learned at CVS is to move at a fast pace. The management is ok, but the corporate part needs work they don't understand that you need more staff at work to perform the task that need to be done they need more workers on a shift and that's what makes this job hard and they don't like to pay over time. Will raise your pay but cut the hours so you balance out basically. The hardest part about this job is meeting target or number because they don't give you enough people on a shift to get it done. the only thing that I enjoy about this job is the customers some of them."
bad,My fellow employees made it very stressful to work here. They acted caddy and jealous of one another no team work. I felt like I was back in high school honestly.
bad,"When I first started with the company it was amazing I enjoyed coming to work, then slowly the company made huge changes (which I am all for changes) that made our job tremendously unbearable. While all that was happening CVS cut our staff hours in half, so while working on a shift with four techs, you now only have two techs and the same amount of work to be done."
bad,You never know your exact hours for the work day until you get there and then you could work up to 12 hours on any given day without warning. You have to lift push pull and carry heavy totes. A lot of new faces come and go in this company. They hire and fire like crazy.
bad,I have never worked for a more disorganized and dysfunctional employer.  They do not provide the correct information or tools needed to perform the job they expect you to perform.
bad,Discontinued Loss Prevention Program - Nation wide lay off due to a Market Investigator in Texas who chased and killed a Shoplift subject outside the store. San Diego Team rivaled New York and SD  Team was running with complete efficiency.
bad,"Good place to work to gain experience, but not to make a career out of . Like any customer service job , you have to deal with rude customers, and , employees. This is a fast paced environment so if you’re not a quick learner, I strongly advise you to look else where . This a low paying job , with horrible hours, constant stress from management and corporate. Apply with caution ."
bad,"The general workplace was focused more on the bottom line than on the employees. 1 person was expected to do the work of three, with an understaffed pharmacy and demanding management it made it a very stressful environment to work in."
bad,Working for the Cvs company was very easy as far as the workload went. I was compensated well however they fail to create a professional standard. there leader ship teams seem to be ill trained and ill equipped with the tools needed to run a store and there willingness to turn a bylined eye to policy violations seems to creates  waterfall effect that causes ore problems than it solves
bad,The corporate management is completely out of touch with the pharmacy level. Technicians and pharmacists are overworked and underpaid. Benefits include flexible work hours.
bad,"Do not wish to review the company, a typical day at work, management, workplace culture or any such information due to the fact that I'm currently working there."
bad,"For my experience, this was a stressful place to work. After about 3 months on the job the issue of rates for production became an issue. Management wanted 40 prescriptions per hr along with answering the phones in the front end. Coupled with a computer system which was very challenging,it was difficult to play by the rules and attain the production quotas. In the back end of the pharmacy the requirement was to check between 120  to 140 prescriptions per hour. A daunting task  for any pharmacist to perform without making any errors as well. It was made clear that for management the job was about the numbers!"
bad,Worked very hard from clerk to manager. Wanted to go back to school to move on to the minute clinic area but was promised something that was never completed on their side of the promise.
bad,"Work hours are extremely long, don't apply if you have children to raise.  Lack of staff brought many safety concerns but cooperate doesn't care because they just want to bring in as much money as they can."
bad,"Great pay but understaffed to compensated payroll resulting in overworked stressful environment. advancement opportunities but despite the internal propaganda, no real support from DM or corporate."
bad,Corporate management making things more difficult than they really need to be from times to time when they try and give you training exercises to get done in a timely manner they will wait till last minutes to tell you that they need to get done asap or will be written up or fired
bad,insecure job poor management poor employee relations I would not recommend CVS to anyone they treat their employees as if they are theives and not trustworthy
bad,"Although I was a pharmacy extern that was just starting out, from day 1 was absolutely stressful. What I expected was a high volume pharmacy that would be manageable, what I got was a high volume pharmacy where I was constantly berated and where the pharmacy manager constantly talked trash about me to the patients and humiliated me on a daily basis."
bad,"It's a great job for someone who do not have small kids or none at all. To me they can start off with a little bit more due to the fact you going to work at 7 a.m. till whatever time we get finish, but that can be 9 or 10 at night 5 days a week. The checks do pay off, but you be to tired to do anything on the weekends."
bad,"I've only been there a month and I've already been talked about the employees are mesh ,the managers are respectful we just got a .75 cent raise which comes to $11 before my 90days ,the company is alright the hours /workloadsare long,and yes u will never know what time u get off the latest I've gotten off was 8pm off every holiday/weekend, KEEP YOUR BUSINESS/PERSONAL LIFE TO YOURSELF😊😊 employee discount aint bout nothing overall benefits are great,would I refer you to this company😏😏idk I love that I'm off every weekend, 30 lunch/15 min breaks goes by fast so pack a light lunch, u have to be at a 90% or higher with your rate throughout the day,they rush u when the truckers are ready to go,overall I'll stay for now its alot of people leaving after they start they think its a peace of cake it hard work keeping up with everyone else..."
bad,"Work very hard for very low pay. Don't have any time to relax or sit. Working with a skeleton crew and corporate expecting the same things done as if you have double the workforce. Going home completely exhausted and can't even go out and have fun with friends, because your way too tired. You go to work sick because there are no floater Pharmacy Technicians. You will be lucky if you can even go on vacation."
bad,It was a good job that taught me very good skills to carry forward. Very good job to get through college. No really big complaints
bad,"This is by far the worst place that I have ever worked. Customers never received their medications in a timely manner. Every customer that I spoke to told me how much they hated CVS. Worked in outbound, but spent the bulk of my time taking inbound calls, so my work task continued to build up and that made customers get their medications later and later. This company doesn't have enough staff for the amount of clientele that they have which is just going to drill this company right into the ground. Training was only a week and then they put you out on the floor and expected you to know what you were doing, when you had an issue that would arise they expected you to IM someone for help. If you get hired here expect high blood pressure, tension headaches, and days where you will go home crying."
bad,"Very busy work environment with not so easy going customers. Management can definitely be improved. Very good work experience, but certainly not for everyone."
bad,"Was not pleased. Once CVS joined CAREMARK it changed. it was suppose to make a better company but that was only for the CEO not the employees. It made it very difficult to like your job and going to work everyday. Not enough staff, limited hours and twice the work."
bad,"A typical day at work based on organizing the isles as well as making sure they were stocked. Also, making sure customers were satisfied. Management did not appreciate the staff when they were putting all of their effort and going beyond they're responsibilities."
bad,"The job itself entitles a lot of responsibilities for a technician, but its worth the knowledge and the headaches when you hear the most sincere thank you from someone who really appreciates all of the work you put into their script."
bad,"Training not what I was expecting. You read through hours worth of material on computer (which you are compensated for), but on the job training terrible. I was shown two or three times how to do something, then just thrown out on my own and told to ask questions as needed. Not exactly the type of job be trained like that. After a short time I was told I should be moving quicker, yet I feel I was not given enough time to learn any one componet to feel comfortable with anything. When I expressed my concerns, I was told it just takes time. So which is it?!? Co-workers very nice, but they were getting just as frustrated as I was :("
bad,"the job was very demanding, their was not enough staff. Their was some management that was helpful and some that were just worried about self. It was really a factory job. I was not happy there. the teamwork was not there. They always seem to be really pushing and keeping you over cause the orders always ran over. they would hold orders so they would get out on time and make seconds late. It was a lot of teamwork and manager issues. They couldn't keep employees."
bad,A typical day at work for me would be one where I am busy and not standing around. I love to interact with others. The hardest part of a job is when you have other co-workers that want to bring thier drama to work with them.
bad,the training was not good. took way to long befor I got to start work .
bad,I Really like working there but Management was too one sided they have favorite
bad,"When I started at cvs 6 years ago, it was fun. Your co-workers really make your day go by fast. The work was easy and the customers weren't so annoying. Today its all about numbers. Get as many customer emails or get written up. Say the company phrases (even to your regulars who could care less) or get written up. Spy on the cashiers to make sure they are asking for the emails and saying the 6 phrases and then interviewing them by a camera so management could then spy on us to make sure we are doing it right. And then write the cashiers up for missing a phrase! Its demeaning, its stressful, and its pointless. They waste all this money having meetings about how to micromanage the employees, tie our hands to properly do our jobs and hang a threat over our heads of losing our jobs. And cvs is about customer service, I understand that. But to be bullied and abused by the same customers who complain to corporate that we didn't let them cheat the system, and corporate then comes down on us that we should give away items, coupons, money for free is just down right confusing. If you are absolutely desperate work for this company. Otherwise they are just an expensive version of walmart."
bad,the company is fire happy and management is all over the place and they short you on your paychecks especially if you do overtime
bad,"Management was awful. No support from management, no direction, no list of things that needed to be done, no communication. manager picked favorites, trained cashiers in tasks that only supervisors were supposed to do but didn’t train the supervisors. Did not train on money gram machines, picture machines. No product knowledge. I was horribly stressed at this job, and went back to my former job."
bad,They let you know your replaceable! They do not care about you! The minimum wage is not enough to pay market rate rent. Turn over rate is very high. Not much opportunity to advance
bad,"I was excited when I first started this job and now I hate it. Poor management, rude people, rude bosses, too busy to properly train yet expected to know everything. The company keeps pushing on more things when we are already short handed and they are still cutting hours. Store 5514 - I wouldn't recommend to anybody, hopefully its better at other locations."
bad,"I used to love working for cvs, but in the past couple of years the company has gone down hill considerably. Almost half of the year the hours get cut at every store so instead of being able to enjoy the holidays you’re stressed on how your going to be able to pay your bills. There’s too much focus on the customers and none on the hard working employees."
bad,"The first 2 years I was employed I loved it. Then as they kept purchasing things, thy kept cutting hours and the only person left to work was the salaried store manager. The work\life balance became non-existent. We were paid for 45 hours but were working 60-70 plus every week and that's not right. I feel they were taking advantage of us being salaried; free labor."
bad,Highly recommend not working here.I was with the company for over 12 year before i put my notice in.You are just another number!! They don’t value you. They don’t give enough payroll hours to properly run their business the way it should be ran. You make decent money but you are over worked. This business is all about the higher ups and the employees in store that actually run their busy is really who they need to focus on. That is the face of your company. You don’t have any life out of the job. They don’t have set shifts you always work something different. Theirs no organization! They put new work loads on but never enough staff to get it done. I don’t think in all the years I worked for them I worked with anyone that enjoyed their job. The way your store is rated is absurd. If you get rated under a 9 your score goes down. You never have enough employees to give the customer service that should be given in a place of business that is supposed to be concerned with customers health. Then you are rated poorly for it. It’s a loose loose system. The system to push over stock is a joke. The Dm that orders isn’t in the store so they either order to much or not enough inventory for holidays. You are a health store but push so much unnecessary products. Most of it gets scanned in Damages or sent back or sits on our shelves for years. Honestly whoever is in charge of the way your business runs needs to be fired. To save money you cut in the area that’s most important payroll and raises. I hope one day you get someone in their that actually wants to run a good busy and isn’t focused
bad,"Low pay, a overly strict attendance policy and bad management are a few of the factors that has lead to such a high turnover rate for the CVS Health call center."
bad,The teamleader think she’s knows everything and if asked a question she doesn’t have an answer. Everyone that doesn’t kiss butt and she doesn’t like she harass until they are gone! No matter the situation. She always telling everything true or not!! No room for growth
bad,Manager was annoying but friendly and on top of things. Very boring. You will be expected to stand at the front and stare at the back of the store until a customer walks in.
bad,"too many tasks not enough staff, upper mangement doesnt send help. customers in area are especially hard to deal with no appreciation from upper management"
bad,"Company is very much about the number crunching.  New management has a ""in your face"" approach to achieving and monitoring outcome numbers.  This makes a stressful job even more stressful."
bad,"taking prescription order counting medication, doing inventory of medication, customer service, answer phone, worked to pick up and drop off window. work closely with the pharmacist.hardest part of my job (at that time) was keeping up with all the things it takes to run a pharmacy. most enjoyable part were the people i worked with and the customer"
bad,CVS/Pharmacy is a company with strong values and focus on customer service. The growth from this organization is expected to surpass various goals in the near future.
bad,Nothing good to say about how they treat new employees. If you're not a favorite you don't get hours. Treat customers like royalty but treat employees like dirt. Room for advancement if the managers like you.
bad,"CVS Health good company as far as taking care of employees, Pick Deptartment very unorganized. The starting pay was good, we received a free Turkey and Christmas Gift Card."
bad,"fast paced, customer service was a must , hardest part of the job was dealing with cranky patients and sometimes the staff didn't work well together , but overall it was great."
bad,The typical day at work is dealing with front store manager that is not there for her employees. I work in the pharmacy and it is very fast pace and understaffed.
bad,"Sitting in a box for 8 hours being battered by people who cant get their medicine, or hearing sad stories about people dying.  Good pay but the job itself is just a emotional rollercoster."
bad,cashier
bad,Working at OmniCare was a rewarding experience. I learned about the different medications and its uses and its overall effects on patients. Patients confidentiality was a very important factor within this company. The pros of the job were hour lunches and Excellent teamwork. The cons were working long hours five days a week and having a lack of supply on medications for the patients at times. Overall working at OmniCare was fun and Productive.
bad,Nothing to really say to any of this I just had to make this long enough in order to save it this is ridiculous this is my third time adding to make this longer
bad,"Where do I even begin? From the time I started, I never felt welcome there. Not one co-worker made an effort to get to know me during the time I was there. Terrible training. The trainers literally never taught me how to do anything and if I asked questions, they would mock me in front of the customers. They were terrible communicators with the customers about their prescriptions and of course, I would end up taking the fall for it. One of the pharmacists was one of those people you read about on memes when people say, ""Don't join healthcare if you don't care about other people's health."" Don't work here  course I took the fall for it because I was always at the front"
bad,"Things I tried to help organize to make things easier were looked down on.. This place was the most unorganized, chaotic pharmacy I'd ever worked at.."
bad,Cvs is all about being number one all they want is to work you hard and no rewards.          They are all about the money.          Would not recommend working for cvs
bad,Wasn't trained properly within a month like I was told I'd be and was still expected to carry out daily work like I did. Not a desirable job if you're trying to finish school.
bad,They obligate you to work hours double with no choice. No days off. No respect for medial appointment or personal needs. No benefits. No respect. The human resources never answers or return calls
bad,I would never reccomend anyone to work there they dont care about customers and they especially don't care about. Their employees. Horrible company to work for
bad,"Started out as an okay job as a Pharmacy Technician, now I consider it one of the worst places I’ve ever worked. CVS is becoming more about the money and not so much about their employees or customers. No one should have to dread going to work. Cut hours, no staff, and nonstop stress."
bad,"IF YOU DO NOT HAVE COLLECTION EXPERIENCE DO NOT APPLY HERE. They say that you they care but from my experience, its all about the money. The turn over rate is extremely high.To illustrate this, mt training class had over 30 new hires. By the end of 3 months, over half of the class had quit. As one person mentioned in the rating, kissing up and favoritism is high. On the other hand, if you have collection experience this is a good company to work for if you can tolerate the above issues"
bad,I really disliked working for this company. Some of the employees were rude and in my opinion racist. Many of the customers were rude and disrespectful.
bad,You do entirely too much work for you to complete and then there’s always problems where you run back and forth in management customers are aggravating waiting til you leave to call for help
bad,I would not recommend working here for anybody looking for hours or need to pay bills they are not flexible with hours! They don’t like to pay people at all
bad,"It's a giant corporation, which means they cut hours every year and expect the same performance. For some reason the company is fine with their pharmacists constantly rushing and their pharmacies functioning in chaos, which is dangerous."
bad,"Was difficult to balance helping customers, ringing up customers, and stocking shelves. "
bad,Not enough hours to staff employee correctly if you are not able to multitask you will not survive   you will be doing five things at once drive-thru pick up answering phones in probably editing  a prescription you will not get a break although it is legally required unless you just run out of the pharmacy when it's clear which is never there's always somebody in front of you pick up drop off drive thru consultaion  horrible training class you will not learn a thing and when you get to CVS you will be thrown to the Wolves  figure it out yourself
bad,"It was okay, defintely a stressful place with the inbound calls and the grumpy customers who do not understand how insurance works and take their frustrations out on you."
bad,"The work is rewarding, but the company doesn't care about their employees. Pay isn't worth it, and no hrs are ever available. The person who has been there the longest gets all the hrs."
bad,Require to much and don’t give what you need in people to finish jobs cut hours at the beginning of each year want to offer great customer service but then once again unable to finish tasks or not able to give the customer service that’s required pay is terrible
bad,Fast paced. Busiest store in the district. Employees call off on a daily basis and nobody does anything about it. They make you help the pharmacy because pharmacy is the only reason cvs is even open. Do not I repeat do not work here.
bad,I work as a pharmacy tech and one day hope to be a pharmacist. However the things I see go on at my current job scare me! I see very incompetent people where I work who don't really care. Sometimes I wonder if they are trying to make mistakes but then pretend they didnt. I don't plan to be in my job much longer.
bad,They hire managers who know nothing about the job who tell you what needs to be accomplished in a day... which in tells doin a four person job within 8 hours. IMPOSSIBLE!
bad,"Upper management set unrealistic goals for an understaffed team.You had to do triple the amount of work because they're too cheap to hire more people. I was left alone to man the whole store,cashiering and management duties,while it was busy for an hour.Received zero training in photo and moneygram transactions.Pretty much had to learn everything as I went."
bad,"I’ve been a tech at cvs for over 7 in Philadelphia. I was told my management if I get certified it would guarantee me a raise. Went through said process and received  nothing but consistently being told by the pharmacist I must display my CPHT certificate. If you’re lucky to get a decent pharmacist kudos to you. Majority are cvs slaves who take their frustration out on their techs. Pay is sub par, don’t expect much . When it comes to training, they send you to classes which barely teach you anything then throw you into a hectic work environment. Pharmacists will get mad at you for not knowing things you weren’t taught or barely understand. You will ALWAYS be short staffed yet still expected to get all the work done. And last but not least expect customers to insult you, spew racist remarks, and even spit on you . Guess what cvs does? Apologize to them for whatever you did to provoke their assault and provide them with a 25% off coupon. CVS DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS EMPLOYEES. You have been warned ."
bad,Corporate has done major cut backs on the amount of employees they want working in the store at any given time. You will work at least 4-5 hours a day by yourself and still expected to get all your work done. You basically do the work of 10 people by yourself. And you only qualify for benefits if you are full time which is very hard to get. The store manager is great as is the staff. But low pay for the work and stress you have to deal with.
bad,"BURNOUT OR BURN THROUGH! We Care is lip service. It should be We Care...about money.  Inadequate support staff help. Will target and make conditions worse until you quit or can't achieve their ridiculous requirements.  Buys out competitors, drives the teams out, ruins the business for the sake of competitor elimination. CVS Caremark forces participation in their own pharmacy locations and their PBMs reduce reimbursement rates for their competitors to starve them out (how this does not violate Fair Trade and Antitrust laws is anybody's guess).  Regularly makes promises to secure an agreement then rewrites policy afterwards in order to not have to honor the agreement (Bait and Switch)."
bad,"This job is the worse the company is not good at all you have to kisses ,as so you can improve ,10 cents is your raise every year ,I work for this company 13 years and the cheat on my ot also my vacation and there is no commitment no loyal only 2 employees for the hall store sucks no lunch no brake and to much teaft they dont care about employees por your life never work for this conpany. Again thanks god."
bad,CVS asked me to take a position 1200 miles away and when I agreed and relocated they eliminated the position with no apology or any reimbursement of moving expenses of any kind. They would NOT even take my call out of pure embarrassment and shame. CVS would NOT pay any overtime and if you had overtime they would make you “shave off” those hours the following week to make up for it. They are the worst employer I have ever heard of in all of my working adult life!
bad,"If you're an RN DO NOT WORK HERE! Management is un organized. Lack of training. Constant calls, high workload. Frequent on call schedule. Frequent weekends."
bad,If you like drama an no help to do your job that's the right place for you. Patients going off an cussing you because there medication isnt ready.When they was told it was an they call you names an throw stuff at you.
bad,"Warehouse is a dump. Trash and product everywhere and the people can care less. Back stabbing management team and if the workers dont like you, they will simply go over your head and know that whatever they say will be looked at and honored as the truth.  GOOD LUCK"
bad,"This company has very poor training , they lie about how training works to get you in the door. The staff belittles employees. They mess payroll up constantly."
bad,"There is blatant favoritism, no one owns their mistakes and there is constant criticism. The store I worked in was a joke. The entire staff had to be turned over a few years ago because everyone in there (including the manager) were stealing merchandise and money. I didn’t kiss my bosses butt enough so I got overlooked for advancement on multiple occasions. I also was left with whatever shifts needed to be covered while other people got set schedules. There was people stealing at least a dozen times a day. Our Loss Prevention guy even got fired for stealing! This company is joke. They don’t care about the employees or their safety. Stay far far away."
bad,"Save yourself the stress and go someplace else the turnover for this company is horrible. All the store are under staffed and run on you and a cashier. DL’s don’t care about their stores all they see is the numbers it doesn’t matter if your store is sinking and you are stuck with no help, poor company to work for. No chain of command to follow your employees are all backstabbing everyone in the back. But if you are a trouble maker or lazy you will succeed at this company. They treat you like a slave and don’t care about you as a person."
bad,"Just awful. Favoritism, power hungry managers, and inequality abounds. One of the worst places ever. Salary and benefits were bad for a healthcare company."
bad,"I wouldn't send a person I hate to work for Cvs. Upper management are constantly cutting the hours but still insist that employees have to do PCQ calls daily, returns, modules, and other things that you can't possibly keep up with because there is NEVER enough help in the pharmacy. A typical day is 1 technician opening the pharmacy and the next tech coming in about 1pm. The pharmacy is overstaffed and overworked. I see techs that used to go above and beyond, not care anymore. I'm pretty sure Cvs does not value their customer's business or safety."
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy under a controlling and disrespectful pharmacist. She was often very rude to the workers and customers. Her frequent rants and outbursts caused a very stressful workplace. "
bad,"Unless you have no choice, DO NOT apply for this job. The training isn’t good. They teach one way how to do things and then when you do it the way they trained you, you get dinged for it. Only allowed 3 person per dept to request off at a time. Apparently they had bed bugs. Managers don’t do nothing all day but hover over your shoulders and smoke cigarettes all day. This job is for people who literally just wants to work and that’s it. You better make production or they won’t give you over time. Lunches are too short insurance isn’t too good. They make up rules as they go. Prime example unless you’re a supervisor, you cannot to use your computer to clock out. That’s crazy because there is so much people in that place. Bathrooms smells like raw meat everyday. There’s a whole list of issues. I’d rather work in fast food."
bad,"The hardest part about this job is learning how to deal with stress. The customers come into the pharmacy not feeling well or have just heard some bad medical news, they are upset, and they tend to unload that on the poor cashier."
bad,"Much depends on store manager who is caught between appeasing customers & his superiors.  CVS will listen to its customers before they will listen to their employees.  From District managers on up, they go too much by the book when it comes to their employees, but not the customers.  If an employee does one thing wrong & the district manager &/or loss prevention finds out about it, you're about through.  Loss prevention & district managers do more to ruin customer relations with a store than do the managers"
bad,"no help means stressed workers and no help means longer lines and wait times, do not pay enough, cutting hours, no raises, weird work schedules, no one to cover breaks"
bad,"I worked for this company for 15 years and it started off as a great company but over the years, it slowly became one of the worst companies I've ever worked for."
bad,"wont ever catch me back in there. terrible TERRIBLE treatment of employees. when I worked there, it snowed like 4 times, so obviously most people couldn't make it in, especially those of us who lived far. they gave us points that counted against our attendance. it took for one of the other employees to call corporate and make a complaint for them to remove all of the points we accumulated during those snow days, some people had kids they needed to cancel overtime for the day it snowed and they said that no one could leave. they would basically allow you to sign up for as much overtime as possible but not cancel it if a situation like that came up and it needed to be cancelled. nobody knows weeks in advance that its going to snow like that. it was completely out of our hands. they didn't care about doctors notes either and your points don't roll off for a whole year. it was h*ll please do not work for this company"
bad,"Very Corporate Driven. They only care about the numbers. No breaks. Very short staff. Very high demand, but no means to complete it. Not personable. Not recommended."
bad,CVS health have great benefits.  They expect more calls then can be completed without being errors in it.  There is also management problems.  No problems with Cultural Diversity.
bad,"I was a hard working cashier, was offered an opportunity to become a pharmacy tech. Went through a challenging three month training program only to be told shortly after completing the program that my hours were being cut completely due to my lack of seniority in the company."
bad,"I worked in CVS in Totowa New Jersey at Coram I was a CSS. It was a new Department we were clinical support for the nurses. The supervisor we had was a bully, showed favoritism towards other people, was unfair, and was downright unprofessional is a joke for a supervisor."
bad,They expect you to give your all while cutting hours and pay. They care more about numbers than patient care. The only good thing is that its easy to transfer and maternity leave
bad,"Poor company to work for, does not care about employees. Many of my fellow employees and managers are also unsatisfied. Unrealistic expectations that anger customers and extremely understaffed."
bad,"The worst experience ever. I was treated unfairly and if there were any errors I was making, no management would correct me or speak to me about how to resolve any issues"
bad,They did not follow the rules as a company and I felt awful being part of their team as it did not meet the clients needs what so ever do not work for them!
bad,Once CVS took over Target Pharmacy we saw much more micro managing and more stress applied over company metrics from management. The company culture and reputation are not good.
bad,found this job through an agency. agency took almost 2 months to get me my paycheck so i quit due to not having gas money to get to work and not being able to pay my bills on time
bad,"The tasks at hand were not difficult, the customer service was hard due to the attitudes of customers since they were either sick or dealing with a person who was sick so days were difficult."
bad,CVS in crawfordville is good. Managers are great and techs are awesome. Pay is okay but not the greatest. Very stressful place to work and face paced.
bad,"I went to a hiring event for CVS Health. They’d sent me a invitation to apply and then come out on yesterday in Orlando. After completing the application online and the assessment ; I went to the hiring event."
bad,You start off as a Selector. You are on a timed system. The time is constantly manipulated so it gets difficult to maintain your weekly average. Management is very shady. Lots of nepotism in that facility. I wouldn recommend that place to an enemy!
bad,a typical day consisted of making several calls to facilities in order to process prior authorizations. and once again the people were the best assets
bad,"I can't find a positive thing to say about working for these non caring people.  The staff were very caring, but upper management, had real big issues."
bad,"As a pharmacy technician, work can become very stressful especially during peak hours. However, this teaches one to work in a fast-paced, stressful work environment, which definitely builds character."
bad,"Incredibly stressful. Especially with the company hamstringing the schedule and leaving the staff thin repeatedly then condemning the management for the poor performance of the store. An extremely corporate environment. The leadership outside the store was not cruel, simply disconnected."
bad,Total overall view of CVS Health is that it is too large of an organization to be managed properly.  Individual locations management can be good or bad.
bad,This job was pretty bad. Not about patient care it's about how many cards you scan daily and how many modules you get done. Schedule is picked by a young girl who picks and chooses her shifts and leaves everyone else to work the garbage shifts
bad,"My CVS IT experience, as well as many of my colleagues', has been very disappointing.  I contracted there for 2 and half years, and found the work environment chaotic, with frequent ""process changes"" that generally worsened the exploitative pressures placed on employees and contractors alike.  By pressuring workers to labor more than 40 hours per week, while concurrently persuading them to manipulate their time-card hours, it is likely that CVS may someday be prosecuted for wage theft."
bad,Same routines and repetitive work. Not much of a community environment. I ended up getting a settlement for the hours they made me clock out and get my bags checked whenever i walked out. like there's no trust in the employees. but the pharmacist didn't get coat and bag checks only the lower paid jobs.
bad,"Worst place I ever worked!  I have worked in many types of industries and CVS is the worst company!  I won’t even shop there anymore.  Their management is awful!  All they care about is sales, not people.  Upper management ignores their staffing issues so they are always under staffed.  They burn through employees.  Take my advice:  Don’t even apply!  Pharmacy much worse than front store!!"
bad,Low pay. They went thru people too fast. Morale was very low.No one cared about their job. Management seemed to like it this way. They went thru mgrs. faster than employees.
bad,CVS became a starter job for me fresh out of pharmacy school. I thought it had advancement and gave quarterly raises like promised during the interview but never received one. This job single handedly made me change my profession to still work in pharmacy but never again in retail.
bad,fun tho hard to work at because it's always getting robbed the store is bad I get help up there and they throw away things that aren't even expired yet and is sad
bad,Bulling is ingrained in the culture. its not fun to work at. Politics and disregards is all around. very difficult to move between departments.-------
bad,"CVS Pharmacy (the retail aspect) is the typical retail experience, except the company seems not to take care of its employees by doing simple things like providing overlap or giving lunch breaks to pharmacists."
bad,By far the most stressful job that I ever had. Dealing with self entitled customers while striving for standardized metrics with little help was not a pleasant experience.
bad,"I would never recommend that anyone take a job as a pharmacy technician at CVS when nearly any other retail pharmacy will treat them better, pay them more, and offer some modicum of respect to them. Work in a hospital, or at Kroger, or literally anywhere else. I wouldn't go back for any reason."
bad,"worst environment ever, supervisors are awful and harass you. Pay for what you do there isn't remotely close. No rewards no bonuses and no additional compensation."
bad,I will never work for this company again.  They undermined me and I have never been so rudely treated as an employee.  I will never work for this company again.
bad,"my hours were cut 90% after the 1st month working there,  People were rude and disrespectful,  I did not receive 1 raise the entire time. I was told after i was Certified i would be full time with a raise and they didn't do anything they agreed to do."
bad,"Quotes need to be meet but with great quality. I was able to brush up on billing as well as doing A/R. The management needs better communication skills. The hardest part of the job is having projects and not know what to do. The communication and innovation is not great. There are too many systems that you have to work out of, when it could be simplified."
bad,"I rarely left work on time. I was yelled at by customers a MINIMUM 5 times per shift. My coworkers made the job more difficult than necessary by not performing their jobs correctly, and I rarely got lunch/bathroom/mental health breaks due to the high volume store and being short staffed."
bad,They discriminate people with disabilities. They will not speak with you if you have one. They will ignore you and refuse to work with you... It's pretty sad
bad,"Absolute worst managers "
bad,was the worst job i think i ever had.  wasnt at first but it became very hostile workplace after a while.  all in all bad place to work.  i wanted out pretty quick.
bad,"It's retail whether you work in the pharmacy or the front store it's all the same. Short lunches, fluctuations with your hours. One week you will have 40 hours and the next only 12.  No sick time or benefits for part time employment."
bad,run around like a chicken with your head cut off. never had enough help and the pay was way to low. great pharmacist and coworkers. I went to visit them after I quite and one tech was running 2 registers and printing scripts. It was crazy.
bad,"•	Assisted pharmacists with medication dispensing, reconciling and filing of medications"
bad,I have applied 3 different times for a Pharmacy Tech position in a period of 1 yr. Every time I apply I have to take about an hour to do an assessment and all. After I apply I call to verify they got the application and I am always told they are not looking for anyone. Apparently the store manager has no idea why the website says there is an available position but there is none. Don't waste your time applying like I have.
bad,One of the worst places I ever worked . management  was about the same as other place . scheduling was a little strange .temporary employees .llew detaert ton erew
bad,Its very hard to work for a company that hires management that has no prior supervision experience and when its brought to the attention of Human Resources and there management nothing changes.
bad,"okay, not much to say, pickup, production,drop-off, drive-thru,verify. i do enjoy working with my fellow co-workers!"
bad,"I strongly suggest applying somewhere else."
bad,Sucked i didn't enjoy the majority of my experience there at all there lack of customer care is ridiculous i wasn't able to my job from the lack of effort on the company's behalf
bad,"Low pay, too busy, no respect to employees. Just a place for new high graduates to work for one year or so to gain some experience."
bad,"POOR MANAGMENT"
bad,Cvs Health was a good place to work but they didnt give any slack on the snow when it snowed at all. They let me go because I missed days because of the snow. Im not going to risk my life to drive in the snow when I know I cant.
bad,To some up my job experience for this particular job is it was just really bad. This job just wasn't for me and management was terrible.
bad,"the staff at the cvs is horriabloe!!!!! I worked at a different cvs pharmacybefore and it was like night and day. the needham cvs pharmacy staff didn't care at all about coustomer service. we didn't work as a team, it was extreamly clicky. I had never in my life hear a pharmacist yell and be so rude to a customer befoire in my life. you coulkdt pay me enough money for me to ever work with thos people again. when I first started I thought all the coustomers were so mean and rude, then found out it wasn't the coustomers but the staff"
bad,Was pushed on a register after informing I had no prior experience. the pharmacy manager was very rude at times. I constantly felt pushed around and was eventually given the option to either keep my other job and quit there or to keep this job and leave my other job after I had informed them from the start that this would be my second job and I had no intention of leaving.
bad,Don't work here if you want to receive your final check. I've been trying to get this check since October and still waiting.
bad,enjoy working at cvs. like answering customers questions and help finding what they need. help drive the sales up and creating good customers service
bad,"It was ok working there, They really didn't care about their workers. I lived an hour away and always had to work the late shift. I wouldn't work there again."
bad,"I think my boss was threatend because she did not have much technical depth.  Very poor management skills and sometimes even personally insulting.  Being a professional, I always do my best work, no matter the environment.  This place was a real challange to my professionalism."
bad,Workload was overwhelming to the point new staff were not effectively trained.  Supervisors did not have time to answer questions.  No consistency in the work process between supervisors.
bad,the company as a whole is great but the employees are rude and are not nice people to talk too. i wasnt happy there from day one
bad,"hours are cut. hate the pharmacists. the pharmacists is young and try to be friends with employees rather than manage them. Everyone creates their own schedule, comes in late and do whatever they please. low pay VERY LOW PAY!"
bad,"This is a call center (a third party)make no mistake about it. A typical day at work consist of cold calling Patient's insurance companies and pharmacies to obtain benefit information for doctors all day long, phone call after phone call, after phone call. The hours are long, the working environment is stressful, the building is cold, you must wear lots of clothes, gloves and stay in your coat in order to make it through your shift. You have half hour for lunch, must earn your sick and annual time and if you have a doctors appointment, etc., better forget it. If you miss work you get points, eight points and your out. Lots of favoritism, lack of team support, lots of little clicks, and no support from management. The most enjoyable part of the day----walking out the door....."
bad,"local management limited in ability to appreciate employees and keep moral up for staff.  overworked, understaffed, underappreciated,"
bad,"This company cares more that you are watched. (Camera's everywhere and all tilted to better view employees don't act out). Your bags are checked before leaving, pockets. I feel a prisoner in this company. I've been transferred against my will three times without reparations (sometimes an extra 40 miles) and the same management that carried out these transfers once I was gone to the next store gave up all responsibilities of their wrongful decision, i.e., no paid-outs for gas. Hours promised are snatched at the drop of a hat. Overall, there are much better retail positions. And no CVS, stopping sales of cigarettes will not make up for the subterranean public relations that are going on your front lines. Fix your disconnect with your employees."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here. Hours a not offered as promised. Stiff environment and does not pay well. Supervisors are not productive.
bad,I didn't enjoy their policies and they treated me with disrespect
bad,Mandatory overtime everyday. Management is not flexible and has no communication
bad,Too hectic; not a comfortable enviornment. Not enough training for the amount of responsibility that you have.
bad,Great company to transfer within. the company was great. eratoih;hioerggrtg rtgsrt er grr
bad,"do not work at omnicare"
bad,"Pharmacy technician job is similar anywhere you go. Fill prescription, ring up customers, answer phone calls, fix insurance issues, do all of the above FAST in 15 min max."
bad,The company was more concerned about the money that they were obtaining instead of the well care of their clients and the happiness of their co-workers
bad,The company does not understand the meaning of retention. The management is uncaring and all about productivity without care to the employees
bad,"The District Manager has overall responsibility for the district P & L and accountable for operational performance and management of store teams to include people development, sales and sales building programs, service, execution of company- wide programs and initiatives, margin and expense control and shrink and asset management."
bad,The work load was not a problem. It was the management. The management was terrible and made the work place an awful environment to be in.
bad,"I left a full time job for this contract to hire position and 2 months later, we got let go due to budget issues."
bad,"The interview process was a complete lie. Everything they told me was false (room for job growth, 5% travel, promote a positive work/life balance).  Didn't get my computer until 3 months after I started."
bad,"Stressed, under payed, under appreciated.  Brown noses do well."
bad,Typical big business. Any stories you hear about workers getting the shaft are true.
bad,"The other CVS locations that I visited and trained in were excellent but the Forsyth Pharmacy was not at all a very good experience for me."
bad,worst place to work if you are looking to be respected for your job quality
bad,"Went for an interview after flying in from Texas and having spoken to HR on numerous occasions. Never once was I asked if I had a pharmacy tech certification (finally revise and reposted to specify REQUIRED PT cert). But this was the first question once I arrived for the interview. Wasted time, but after seeing the place and speaking with the very unprofessional HR rep, I'm not disappointed at all. I also called to report this rep several times and left messages and didn't receive any callbacks, so this says a lot about how much they care. Omnicouldcareless is what the company should be called."
bad,"I filled CII-V prescriptions, sent out narcotic emergency kits for nursing holmes, billed for CII-V medications removed from the kits, pre-packed CII-V medications, inventory for the CII-V medications, updated narcotic kits, expired CII-V medications, kept control room neat and organized, filed control room delivery manifests and filed the delivery manifests for non-controls daily, filed cII-V invoices daily, daily counts, etc..."
bad,"We reviewed enrollment applications and contacted health plans to determine eligibility, out-of-pocket expenses and prior approval requirements"
bad,"I worked at CVS for 9 months, this was a job I did for over 20 years,"
bad,Not a great work environment and poor management. Worked at CVS headquarters in RI.
bad,"MEDICARE MEMBERS CALL VERY UPSET CURSING AND HOLLERING AND REGARDING THEIR INSURANCE PLANS,.You have to continue to apologize to the member and its not my issues and try to the best of my ability to assist them but it is very hard to do."
bad,Another awful place. The management was horrible. Co-workers were all great.
bad,This place is a mess...the management sucks and I'm surprised the FEDS or DEA haven't came and that they are still in business. You don't get paid enough for the amount of work you do
bad,Loads of policies. Felt like I was in school again. Had to ask for permission to do anything.
bad,Good benefits. No opportunity for advancemnt. Over worked and under paid
bad,"I loved working here. Co-workers were amazing, friendly customers, and a busy workplace."
bad,"The concept of the NP being the insurance and billing clerk, as well as doing inventory, janitor and Provider just did not sit well with me. I don't mind cleaning up after me, doing restocking and ordering supplies, but navigating among insurance cards, and billing issues all within the 15 minutes you are given for a visit, just did not sit well. Many of the providers made suggestions to have the computer terminals updated so that patients were responsible for inputting their own information but management was not receptive. In addition we suggested/begged that staffing be re-adjusted during peak flu shot season in high volume areas to reduce the waiting time for flu shot only patients, again, not received well. Supervisors communicated only by email and took days to answer concerns, if addressed at all. Voice mails treated the same."
bad,"Very unexperienced Upper Management, they take people from other companies that dont know anything about CVS."
bad,"I think the summary says it all. I have been with the company for 3 years now and have yet to receive a raise. I have been promised promotions year in and year out and seen nothing. As for the company itself it's miserable and micromanagement to an extreme. Corporate office is trying to squeeze every penny out of the company it can which in general means 60 hours of work during a 40 hour work week. If you eclipse 40 hours in a week your job is threatened which also generally occurs on a weekly or biweekly basis from a branch manager or someone higher anyway. Cvs continues to cut all benefits that were established by legacy caremark not to mention the rotating schedules put in play. I could go on and on about how poor it is but the short story is stay away and work somewhere else. You will regret working here, I rather walk in glass than work here!"
bad,"I let my supervisor know that I was being disturb by a fellow rep that sat close to me and they said they would talk to him and that they were happy that I came to them first!..but, this disturbance continued so I spoke to my staffing agency about it and they said they would look into it. I didn't say anything for like a week or two while the disturbance continued and so I eventually asked him could he please stop the disturbance and he went to management and they moved me! Then a week or two after that, they let me go.."
bad,The hardest part of the job is when you work really hard for them and the company but they don't appreciate it. If you work nonstop for them and call in sick once it's like insulting them.
bad,"Love my coworkers and love my customers, but it almost isn’t worth it because of the company itself. Hours have been cut, yet expectations continue to increase."
bad,"CVS Pharmacy was a great start for students and to get your feet wet in a retail pharmacy, Some pharmacies are busier than others..I've worked at a really busy one and it was understaffed and unorganized"
bad,This company has no regard for their employees at all. They work you hard and don’t compensate for your time or experience. Manager at many stores are rude and not helpful in any aspect of the job. They talk to you and treat you like the wicked step child
bad,I acutally loved working for cvs becuase I know so much and love the work I do. Only bad thing is technicians work so hard and are under payed.
bad,"You come in at 5 in the morning and don't leave till the job s finished, sometimes not until 11 at night. They don't car about family life. They don't care about your health like they portray in the commercials. They work everyone to a heart attack, literally. The hardest part of the job is the hours and being away from your family. The physical work is very easy. The co workers are what make it fun and make the time pass. The management doesn't really care about you or your health as long as you are at work and doing your job."
bad,"Submit Insurance Claims"
bad,i didn't have a good experience but maybe you would. just didn't like the work environment because of the seniority thing and the seniors not wanting to actually work.
bad,We work hard everyday here! We had a good staff that worked as a team! I enjoyed working with the public and taking care of people! They did not like us to have one on one with customers!
bad,"CVS does not value their employees. They come up with these ""bright ideas"" that makes it harder for us employees. Corporate doesn't seem to run a test trial, it seems as if they talk about it and it's done. It's horrible. They never have enough hours available to get the job done. They are actually horrible and I can not wait until I leave."
bad,"CVS/Pharmacy was my first pharmacy technician job. A perk of CVS is they will train you to become a pharmacy technician through  their program, but they'll work you like a horse and they're never is much room for growth within the company, and if so it's not much bigger a job title."
bad,"A typical day at work is providing customer sevice, stocking new medication that comes in on Monday every week. Returning to stock medications that were never distributed to a customer. Recepit and screening medications before labeling and identifying expiration dates. Pulling medication that are expired 2 months before or 2 months after current date. Filing books to keep prescriptions and books organized. "
bad,You have to be transferred too many times and we all say we are CVS specialty. Special groups like insurance and pharmacist have accounts that will never be touched unless patient or representative calls in. It's inefficient but you can learn skills to move to a better job where the program itself is efficient.
bad,"Everyone at CVS was great, only the manager was the problem."
bad,If you enjoy sitting in a chair more often than none. This is the job for you. Policy changes every month. New supervisors every month. No consistency to grow.
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is not knowing what to expect on a day to day basis. The hardest part is dealing with some of the customers. Time management is a major part of the job along with customer service.
bad,"Target was a great place to work but since cvs bought them out less about customer service more about the bottom line"
bad,"I had the opportunity to experience a fast paced work environment,"
bad,"filling prescriptions, making schedules for other technicians, training new employees that joined the compnay"
bad,I learn that team work makes the dream work. I really enjoyed working with my colleagues and the promotions opportunities.
bad,"A typical day at work is a fast paced day, mail order pharmacies fill at least 30,000 prescriptions a day. So there is a lot of work to do but I love it because I like to stay busy. The other employees and mangers are friendly and helpful. The only thing I would dislike about my job is the pay but everything else I really love."
bad,"fast paced"
bad,"Great people to work with, dealing with customers face to face on a daily bases I loved. Great customer service and managers would always work with you. benefits was a blessing."
bad,"A typical day working at Omnicare was very hectic, because of the transiting to CVS, but it was a lot of new changes, and it was very difficult, but over all the job I had made me learn how to work under pressure and neatly,"
bad,"My typical day at CVS Caremark was busy but wonderful. I enjoyed that I was always busy helping our clients get the best service from myself and making sure they were getting their medicine on time. The hardest part of my job was when I heard that a client did not get their life saving medicine on time and when that happened, I always did my best to help them to get their life saving medicine as soon as I could."
bad,I did not like the inviroment and the managment but has good benefets that any employee to be part of the company.
bad,"you have to do so much just to get hired just for a company to not respect you as a person at all. trash management, the customers are rude and love giving you a hard time on purpose, every cvs you go to is understaffed & the benefits aren’t even that good."
bad,"Really terrible with this company , no alavence ,no job security, no incentive, no increment. No job security and no relevant work, the guidelines of the work is worrst"
bad,"Not the best place to work, but I enjoyed the work that I did. Most of the coworkers were great to work with but the management didn't seem to care about the employees like they should."
bad,Don’t work here if you would like to be treated like your a human being. You are treated horribly and if something family wise come up or your sick it is the end of the world. It doesn’t matter you still need to be at your job.
bad,"The branch that I worked in probably wasn't a fair assessment of CVS Health. Very caddy, management would talk about employees in front of other people. This job was probably the most unprofessional place that I have ever worked. The environment was very unhealthy (feathers coming out of vents, mold on rugs, people were constantly sick) No room for advancement."
bad,Company doesn't care about their employees!! Stressful and never have time for yourself. Ive been there for 2 years and i regret it so much . Always short staffed.  Managers are not fair to employees
bad,"Most of the negative reviews for the Account management role are true! Be prepared to feel constantly overwhelmed, overworked and not valued. Most of the Clients and their consultants hate CVS. Consultants go out of there way to make the sales team look incompetent. The management in the Northbrook office lacks diversity. Mostly women in leadership roles. All seem to be mentally unstable  unstable!"
bad,Management was almost nonexistent most of the time. If your not part of the clicks you will never go anywhere in the company. Last minute mandatory overtime.
bad,they don't care about your health or life and they play favoritism with certain people. if they dont like you they will pick on you and no consequence to them
bad,This job treats you like an inmate. You have 10 minutes out of the week to use for the bathroom. So if you go to the bathroom Monday and it takes 10 mins you can’t use the bathroom anymore that week unless it’s on your break. Management is young and rude. Job advancement goes by favorites not performance.
bad,CVS Pharmacy is a job for COLLEGE STUDENTS! Don’t work there if you have children or a growing family. Little room for improvement and career advancement. I forced my way into a management position. They will keep you as a cashier FOREVER! They don’t train you or help you better yourself. Corporate does NOT back their employees. You are constantly over worked. Store never closes no matter what.
bad,"Short staffed to begin with."
bad,"CVS offers much training. The upward mobility was almost zero."
bad,"say they 'care' about patients/clients.. but you are not allowed to be on the phone longer than 5 minutes. If caller had questions related to medications, and wanted a call back, we were told it was not big deal let the next person who gets them take care of that."
bad,You will have occurrences just letting you know if you call in sick you basically need to tell them ahead of time if you don't want occurrences.. Is the job for you if you like to learn one thing and that's it ...
bad,"The daily tasks and procedures were easy to finish. But the management and manager were unacceptable. As a part-timer, no benefits or over time. Manager made multiple verbal sexist remarks about the mentality about and to female associates nor did the manager allow associate to use restroom when needed. Ignored the complaints of customers and employees when there were issues with other associates work ethics. On multiple occasions incidences were reported to corporate and nothing was rectified."
bad,"CVS gave me the opportunity to become a technician with no experience needed. Minus being thrown into the ring my first month with them, i learned everything as i went on with the job."
bad,"working experience varies from store to store, with no real reason why or way to prevent or improve. a typical day at work could include running around all day trying to satisfy customers without the support to do so regularly. nearly impossible metrics to meet with a cut budget that may leave you understaffed. whoever calculates script volume to budget/tech ratio is failing. Management will never accept the fact that budget and tech help is an issue. there is an ineffective system in place thats supposed to make workflow easier that just doesn't work everywhere. very stressful working environment and lots of daily pressure and micromanagement. District leader position is super ineffective as they offer no help or guidance- only pressure and punishment for failure. meetings you must attend on your off day that you don't get paid for. if your lucky you will work with good support staff that will not make coming to work as unbearable as it sounds..... but it still will be."
bad,"I started at a few cents above minimum working as a Pharmacy Tech. Customer service is completely forgotten. I stayed for about two years because I loved how fast paced it was and I loved learning new things. The Pharmacists were very rude (I floated at different locations) usually over worked and fed up themselves. HR doesn't do anything to intervene in situations. The only intervention I got was going from 32 hours to 4hrs a week without an explanation.Higher ups only come in to the store when the state is coming soon. I have been personally yelled at by multiple pharmacists and once told to shut up by one. After leaving that company I knew I would never use their pharmacy ever in my life. If you are new to the company expect to work the ""pick up "" part of the pharmacy for a least a year."
bad,I only liked it when it was Target then after we have been bought by CVS. All the good pharmacists just left and only bad people stayed with such unfair atmosphere. I end up leaving too and I wish I do not have to get back even as a pharmacist
bad,only work for this company for two and half months. the time spent with this company was OK. did not get much experience with this company. worked at 2 different locations so not real stable.
bad,The company itself was not bad however the locations that some people work at are hard to handle especially when they only allow you to have two staff members at a time.
bad,Depending on your district your Field Leader (District Manager) could be great or could be awful.  If they are great then it's a great company to work for part-time or even lower level management (Shift Supervisor).  If your DM is just a genuinely awful individual then your time there will be the absolute worst if you are in an upper level management at the store level (Operations Manager/Store Manager). All in all this can be a good environment if the ideal circumstances are in place but a bad DM will make your life miserable.
bad,The hardest part of the job is being stuck in one position once you have mastered it. You are easily replaceable and they let you know that they don't value you.
bad,The pay is horrible. The staff are not very friendly or helpful to new and learning coworkers. The benefits are not very good. I had an overall bad experience.
bad,The hardest part of the job was being short-staffed and trying to manage long shifts with school. Time-management was crucial. I learned a lot there and it was very beneficial for pharmacy school but it was exhausting both mentally and physically without a set schedule. I benefitted from the time I had there.
bad,. worked at CVS for about 3 and a half years.   The hours fluctuated so much that it was hard to plan my life around them.  My lead was out for health reasons for most of the year and did not really have a good attitude about training me when I first started.
bad,"My direct manager was amazing, however, all of the managers above only cared about numbers. Hours kept getting cut and hold you responsible for bad metrics when they know you are short staffed."
bad,Working at cvs as a pharmacy technician is like being a slave rotating schedule no room for growth unless you know someone they are unappreciative of all the hard work didn’t even want to ke me use the bathroom
bad,stressful unorganized long hours short breaks . management does not care about the employees . bad environment over work . i wouldn't even suggest this place to friend .
bad,"They play favorites and over work their employee's they don't appreciate the good workers and praise those who work less or do incorrect work. The Job itself is not the issue, it's their system and their ""I don't care"" ""do it my way"" attitude. The upper management department is racist and have used several racial slurs and have treated other ethnicities unfairly for just doing their job or practicing their culture"
bad,"For a large corporation, Cvs was ok, for when I was looking for a job, they did their best to work with me indicative to my financial situation in tandem with disability rules. In another situation Cvs was good to me as an employee, In closing I did my best to follow all regulations and rules set forth by the Federal Disability office."
bad,"I currently work here at CVS Health in Woonsocket, RI. My manager is terrible and the most over-the-top micro manager I've ever had. She doesn't know how to manage and basically kills all morale on our ""team"". She is constantly down our necks about progress report updates. The workplace culture is a complete joke as the other 'colleagues' here are downright rude to others. It makes coming here less than fun and dreadful. The only enjoyable part of this 'job' was actually leaving here at night to spend time with my family/friends outside of here. "
bad,CVS is a great place to get started in any career from the cashier to the store manger. It just really depends on where you work. For me it was a touch and go kind of thing.
bad,i dont reccommend unless you want to get state certified through their program. Management wants you to bother senior citizens who most employees know who dont want to be bothered for good scores like a telenarketing business.
bad,"The way they treat the employees, the hours and pay are not great. they treat customers better than the employees, when you want an employee to stay by your side you have to back them up with any concerns they might have. Respect is lacking between management and other employees."
bad,I would like to share that CVS definitely a hard place to work because the work culture is so hard to understand because it was clique and the pay raise was only about ten cents every six months. The hours were low because they constantly put you in at a few hours a week although you were working three to four days per week. I had to close the store at least three nights out the week. It was difficult to get more hours and they were not willing to give me more pay or daylight time hours with only one person working in the front. The manager told me that he did not need a full time front end person because they had one there already. I had to beg to get any pay raise or more hours.
bad,"work load is heavy and not fully staffed"
bad,It worse job i have ever job had. I have learned from this job that if you want to know something outside of your job title you have research it. Work place culture was okay.
bad,"I have learned a lot but training is doesn't allow side by side. The shift bids are not acceptable, getting placed on a schedule which I did not select."
bad,"Below minimum hours, that's why I am looking for a new job. Hours are not guaranteed. I was off for two week and I have bills to pay. The manager didn't give me hours besides that its an ok job."
bad,Very unprofessional. I feel like I'm in a prison! I never in my professional had a co work com attack me to fight. It's been over a week now and HR has yet to do anything about it. I will NEVER refer a friend/family member to this company.
bad,"For a company that preaches they are all about the customers/patients, behind the scenes it is completely the opposite. it's all about the numbers and they are always cutting hours therefore they are always short staffed because corporate does not know what it is actually like to work in the field. if you like working like a dog and have no life outside of this place, and getting paid pennies, then this is the place for you!"
bad,"I was excited about working at CVS and cross training, until I realized how much the manager tries to get you to do their work and how under paid employees are at CVS. I went from having 30 hours a week to 17 hours, due to them hiring new people and from what they say, CVS cuts back on hours during the summer. I began working in the pharmacy as a Tech and only received a quarter raised, now being paid at $9.50/hr. Management does not communicate well, you hear all the changes with your career through the great vine instead of getting the information directly from the manager. This can be very frustration, because communication is key. The hardest part of the job is actually enjoying the environment. he most enjoyable part is clocking out."
bad,was not  good experiance with this.was really busy and tiring and hard working with odd shift timings. too much work was very busy store .got a nice trainer
bad,"The work culture is very stressful"
bad,when i got hired they told me anywhere from 25 to 30 hours didnt even get that in 2 weeks lack of communication and the pay isnt all that great either
bad,CVS does not care about the Pharmacy side of their employees and from what I hear they don't care about the non pharmacy side either.....they do not want you to take your breaks and if you ask than they get mad at you
bad,Looking for career  not what was given . Staff wasn't always friendly. Came to work to go home not enjoyable after so many years
bad,"A typical 8 hour shift is hectic. I've learned that you must work as a team to get daily tasks accomplished. The hardest part is that there is a high turnover rate because management and staff are constantly changing. All in all, the dedicated staff that stays works together to try to meet the needs of the customers and company."
bad,"Loved my job, the tasks, the customers. The Management made the job unbearable. DM forbids consistent schedules for employees, despite health concerns"
bad,"Best co workers to work with, you spend your life at this job with very little home life. Management can not keep staffing. Hardest part of the job is staying 10-12 hours a day without having much home life."
bad,"There were no enough jobs available for staff, the salary was very little, management was poor and staff were not valued."
bad,"It is not a company that seems to be invested in their employees to grow. the tools which they provide you to do your job are constantly having issues, yet they hold you responsible if something happens due to system issues. The management teams seem to look out for themselves,and give you a false sense of security in your job. No employee is perfect, but CVS likes to wait until you're ready to move up or look for opportunities, that is when they tell you  have been doing something wrong the entire time but they said nothing so they use it against you when it comes to reviews and have a reason to fire you and cut their budgets. The retention is rate is awful, people would work for a month and apply somewhere else. They leave the employee at the retail stranded with problems and provided the help-desk very little tools to help. Sometimes when you go to work, the problems feel like they are rigged, as if they purposely do not fix the simple issues just to keep people working. "
bad,"Depending on which location, very stressful and tense atmosphere. Not many opportunities to advance. Management did not handle situations or decisions well. Very hard to balance life with work."
bad,"Helping customers to make lunch, tea. Washing up kitchen plates etc, Helping the customer wash them selves, The problem with this job is the hours, the wages were not as stated when I applied for the job, I had to leave because it was affecting my health and I could not do my job to the best of my ability. I would not do this kind of work again as it may be rewarding but it needs 100% attendance so it is really for a person who hasn't got family ties."
bad,I started with $9.40 pay when most pharmacy technician trainee start with $10.00 minimum. Corporate kept providing less and less hours for the pharmacy and usually one person was over worked beyond those hours. No opportunity of advancement or a peace of mind. no benefits.
bad,"I had an horrible experience, I felt that cvs doesn't value they're employees, I think corporate is too worried about competition"
bad,"You learn alot at a very fast rate, and my co-workers are amazing people. However this company is terrible, they dont value us as technicians, we have to do the work of 20 people with a staff of 5. Are pharmacists are treating like animals and not given the respect and professionalism that they deserve. I had a customer call me the n word to my face, and I was not even given the choice to press charges or have CVS protect me as an employee. At this point in my career I am looking to work somewhere else where I can continue to grow as a pharmacy technician and thrive. Not to be at a place where we are worked to death, under paid, under valued, not respected and stepped on by everyone. To the people who run CVS, what would they do if all of us pharmacy technicians, walked out, or rallied together, spoke out againist company that we slave for and never came back? There is no CVS Pharmacy without your most prized asset, the pharmacy technician."
bad,"hard work, no flexibility with hours. working with patients can be rewarding. overall stressful and no rewards or compensation for all the work you put in"
bad,This is the worst job possible for students who want to work while going to school. Working here leaves you exhausted and with no time to study or do homework. Management depends on the store you're working with; mine treated me with no respect or emotion. Befriended only one shift manager who cared for me like a sister. The hardest part of this job is the task list. Being a back up cashier while trying to close at night is the hardest lesson of time management I've ever had to learn. Seems easy but it's easier said than done. Not a job for the lazy; retail experience is a must.
bad,"ran HORRIBLY, to anyone thinking about working in a retail setting please think very hard. CVS has got to be one of the very worst if not the worst out there. As an employee who worked there in my first year and came back years ago primarily on weekends. NOTHING changed, prescriptions end up lost, lost of lying to patients, lazy pharmacist who try to make you do their job, no  employee equality, very much favoritism, etc. If you have to work here, do it only if you desperately need the money or your just out of school and do it only for a year to get your experience then apply out."
bad,I was in training for a month. They told us we would have floor support from the person that trained us plus someone in our department to help. I was told after a week being out on the floor I could no longer go to the girl in my department for help and then our floor support was stripped from us this week so I myself have nobody to help me by my supervisor and she is always in meetings or busy doing other things and not readily available.
bad,"On a good day we can almost finish all our work, but most days we don't. When i started working at CVS we were fully staffed with 7 to 8 people working daily, but now we are lucky if we have 4-5. The work load is to much for techs to handle."
bad,Everything was fine until we got a new pharmacist in charge that made everyone's life impossible and try to turn everyone against each other. I think before a company gives a person a management position they should send that person to take a course on how to be a manager and how to treat employees.
bad,Was on sanctions so we could not look forward to any advancement or raises for performance. Started bonus program but it only lasted for two months.
bad,"If you are thinking about getting a job with this company I urge you to think twice unless you're really desperate for a job. There is a reason they have such a high turnover rate, you will notice omnicare a lot on indeed if you are pharm tech looking for work. In data entry they expect you to sit at a desk for 8 hours and type 50  prescriptions with no errors in a hour or you are not good enough to them. May seem easy to some, it was at first but day in and day out it will drive you to quit. The training and mgmt is a joke. You can't ask a manager for help cause they are to busy or they don't want to be bothered and you can't ask a coworker for help cause they either don't know or they give you the wrong advice because they have had different training from you so everyone is not on the same page."
bad,I felt as though they cared very little about employees who were ill and who would not be able to work if they had become sick with an illness that could be passed to others.
bad,Was very hard to work with certain people. And the mgmt was efficeint enough
bad,I was a contractor and feel that they really don't put much effort in helping employees in a positive work place to grow and learn. Hours were long and calls were back to back and I feel they were not helpful and true to there word.
bad,"CVS is the LOWEST paying pharmaceutical corporation yet one of the largest in the industry with the highest turn over rate. Pharmacists are forced to work 14 hour shifts with no lunch break and no other pharmacist over lap. Techs are being scored on literally every single thing that is done, including phone call duration with patients, forced to sell the ""item of the month"" where many times it is candy/junk food which is basically saying ""I understand you are struggling with your diabetes but would you like some gummy worms with that?"" The management is always uneducated, corporate-minded ignoramuses who are put in a position of power solely because they are not free-thinkers. Never have I worked in an environment where I see people get bus-rolled on a daily basis and continually being told how poor their work is. CVS doesn't have employees, only cogs in the machine."
bad,"It is mostly sales job, numbers is priority. There's no opportunity to grow with in the company. Pharmacy is open every single holiday and weekends. Very hard to request vacation or days off. No recognition, awards, achievements."
bad,"Answering phones, greeting customers, dealing with billing issues. The management was awful, they were never around. My co-workers for Planet Fitness were amazing, the hardest part of my job was dealing with the management. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to the know the members of gym,"
bad,only hire part-time with virtually no benefits but you work overtime 45-50hrs a week until H.R. starts looking then your lucky if you get 20hrs a week until H.R. turns their back again then repeat the process
bad,A typical day at work includes violations of corporate policies witnessed by management. Work is treated as a middle school lunch and not as seriously as healthcare should be taken. I learned that this companies model is crumbling and most days are more like working at a daycare then a multi billion dollar company. At least the day care children are acting their age. The hardest part of the job is nudging my own manger to work their entire shift or at least half of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is twice a month upon getting my paycheck. A few of my co-workers are hard workers and i enjoy working with them.
bad,"If you work for CVS/pharmacy, don't expect any raises. I had only one in 3 years and it was only 15 cents. No matter how hard you work, management don't care. They expect from their employees a lot but nobody EVER said: ""thank you"" or brought us lunch."
bad,Honestly it was a tough job your on your feet your whole shift. Breaks are rushed sick people yell at you all day. A stressful environment for low pay.
bad,"I dealt with a lot of sexism and racism at my particular CVS Pharmacy store. Unfortunately these things mainly came from the past managers. Most of the Employees are more interested in creating gossip and bad mouthing one another, then actually finishing the list of things that had to be done that day. I spend almost 3 years of my life in this store and I was told because I was and I quote ""an immigrant"" I will not get a promotion. I performed tasks that are way out of my lead for my job tittle with no complains or asking anything in return, I never gotten noticed for it. Few girls (who do not work there anymore) Used to go to the office and eat for 4-6 hours every time we closed together and I did all of the work. Any positive things to say about it? Unfortunately no. "
bad,Extreme work hours. Too many family members working together. Expecting too much out of one person. Nobody sticks up for what's right. People who didn't do anything got promoted. Pharmacists would keep you two hours past the end of your shift. I never want to work long term care ever again.
bad,Depending on the store and the shift the people can be nice.
bad,"No job advancement, management is horrible, new employees get treated like gold while old employees are treated like trash. There are a couple managers that make less money than normal employees. And they have been there for years! Would be a good job if we were treated as valuable employees."
bad,they are very rude and unprofessional i wouldnt recommend this job to anyone
bad,"In the beginning I enjoyed working here, because it was a fresh new job. As I got deeper into it I began not to like it because the store was so small and when I would finish task I didn't have anything else left to do but wait for customers to come to my check out lane. I am the kind of person who has to be always moving and doing something, otherwise I feel the day going by slow and feel as if I'm not being productive. My manager would tell me to go over things that I already had completed, but there's only so many times that you can go over the same thing when its already done successfully. I only would get 2 days of work throughout the week and that wasn't enough for me to survive off of. I ended up getting laid off because of lack of store hours. I felt like I was being given the run around for a while when I would ask why wasn't I being scheduled more hours, then I finally was told there wasn't enough store hours. I feel as a manager you shouldn't be afraid to tell your workers the real deal, because I could have been searching for a new job instead of hoping to get more hours. The best part about this job were my co-workers because we all got along and agreed on things that could be better about the store, and tried to help each other enjoy it more. I learned that people who are given the manager title aren't always worthy of their job."
bad,My overall experience at CVS was not ideal. The work environment was unorganized.
bad,Working non stop from 4pm to sometimes 2am.
bad,"I've never seen a place more disrespective, inconsiderate and rude. There is total non-communication and this is within groups. Management runs their own cliques and if your not lucky enough to be invited in your ignored! If you see a job opening here run, run very fast away. But if you do elect to join ask why the turn over rate is so high and if they say it isn't I wouldn't believe them"
bad,CVS should take care of their employees and ensure that they are compensated for the hard work they provide for the company on a daily basis.
bad,Treated like a subhuman servant for $9.00 an hr. NOT WORTH IT!
bad,-Providing excellent customer service
bad,"This job is a great starter job, it does not provide fast advancement nor is the pay really high."
bad,over work you as well as pushing you to do so much in so little time without even saying thank you or we appreciate you...they are so focused on making money versus satisfying the customers or keeping employees happy
bad,"no set schedule for 1/3 of staff, same 1/3 paid the least,of all employees those in dispensing area are bottom of barrel in company's mind, front end & other staff paid more, even non-licensed staff, 2/3 staff work regular shifts & have a balanced work/life ratio - not the fullfillment team. Management NON-RESPONSIVE to employee requests for training & development especially for fullfillment tech's, just want you to stand there & be a machine, computer system ANTEQUATED & ABSOLUTELY SUCKS to learn!!! Management toothless, will not discipline any supervisor even when laws/rights of employees violated, R.Ph.'s don't discipline each other, need a non licensed PIC to oversee ALL R.Ph.'s. Some R.Ph.'s have immense GOD complex, super huge EGO's."
bad,It was all about getting the products out. If you did not fit in with other management or co-workers then you were on you on. I did my job myself with no help from anyone else. Put my order away. Big heavy bags and bins. I did compounds with little or no help. Management there was none. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting out at a respectable time.
bad,"CVS use to be a very good enviorment to work in,until the econmy starting going bad and they opened up ,to many stores and in order for them to save money i assume,they just started cutting hours and making our job harder and stressful."
bad,"This company does not care about employees in the Pittsburgh area. If you could choose somewhere else to work, I would recommend that."
bad,"Unrealistic quotas that are never met. If they tell you that an area has potential. Run!! It means that an area is doing poor and had been doing poor. Women are jealous and manipulative. Back office staff is unprofessional, constantly making mistakes, makes you look bad all the time because of their mistakes, and will lie at the drop of a hat. Supervisors included. Hi turnover. Coram is an embarrassment."
bad,"When working at cvs was ok, It was just the supervisors and managers that were not professional and don't know to run a business. They need managers with a four year degree."
bad,this place is run like by clicks   everyone has a group and gossip about others and the managers are in it too   if you don’t kiss the managers butts then you get the worst schedule  only certain people get days off they want or holidays  everyone else is screwed
bad,"Everything is fine and you give it your all, but the workload just increases. I had a request for a vacation for the longest time. I did not get my answer until the day of the vacation. I tried finding coverage, but instead, we are so understaffed it is not even funny. CVS is capable of hiring more people, but from what I was told, corporate wants smaller payroll. I didn't blame the management since they were instructed to not hire too many people."
bad,Terrible older employees that do not believe in teamwork. The lackluster management does not care about you at all. It's just manipulation game. Not worth it at all.
bad,"Lots of work not enough workers to jobs"
bad,Don't DO IT. Just stay away. Temp employees are shown favoritism. The Manager doesn't show respect. And most of all its no diversity!!! You stand on your feet for little wages from a multi-million dollar company. The work conditions are HORRIBLE.
bad,You have to be there for 15 years plus to get any respect. Everyone who has been there since the beginning of time are all besties so be careful with who you talk to. Want to take pride in your work? Don't. You get a pen and a round of applause. The pay is low for the stress you are put through. Management and leads pretend to care about your issues at work but it's just the newest gossip for them.
bad,"Stay focused, serve the people above you well. Not a bad place to work, you just have to have a personal goal and work on it everyday. Management is also trying to achieve the goal form higher ups so just keep that in mind that everyone is stressed. But have a great outlook, it is a blessing to have a job in general."
bad,I worked in quite a few stores whether helping out or being a permanent technician and some stores are busier than others. The store I work for in New Jersey is always short staffed because we don't have the hours to give so we have to work in an extremely fast environment and have to cater to our patients immediately. The good thing about working for CVS though is that everyone becomes family and work as a team.
bad,"worked as a technician for 6 months and i hated it, the bosses i had were mean and talked rudely behind there team members back when something was done wrong. customers were extremely hard to deal with most people came in with attitudes. environment overall was not fun. Was underpaid for the kind of work they had me doing as well"
bad,The company doesnt care about their employees. They cut hours every year and expect you to meet quotas and run a store with a manager and a cashier for each shift. They expect too much for little pay. When promoted internally they give you the minimum and for the same position if hired externally they pay the max. They spend all yhis money to install all these systems to deter theft when they can just pay more money to have more employees working which would help more.
bad,"After being wrongfully terminated, I had to contact numerous supervisors from shift manager, to store manager, district manager, all the way to regional manager and support. Had to sue in order to get my final paycheck which came 6 months later. Don't work for CVS."
bad,Very busy call center. Back to back calls all day long. Very high turn over due to how stressful the job is. Management is horrible. Supervisors constantly changing. Benefits are decent. Overtime is available pretty much all the time. Dress code is casual.
bad,No weekly meetings to see where employees are at. You barely get to see the store manager. Expect you to do so many things at once. This is coming from a person who can multitask.
bad,This company expects way too much from their technicians for the amount of money we make. We do more work than the pharmacists and we make pennies compared to them.
bad,When I first started here it was a great place to work but now it’s horrible. We have no hours we are over worked and under staffed. They except us to do way more than what we can actually do in a 13 hour day
bad,"This company was great at first yet 2 years into it management and certain corporate rules brought stress to staff."
bad,"I was tired on at CVS pharmacy in Cleveland TX and was promised eatleast 15-20 hrs a week, I’m barely getting 8-10 hrs a week. Work environment sucks."
bad,"Lots of false promises and over exaggeration of commissions with  impossible to meet goals.  Quarterly payouts ,,,but if you didn't met, meant you had to wait 6 months or more for your commission check.... and base pay not enough to live with.  I made more as a floor nurse in the hospital!"
bad,Full timers get their schedule then part timers fill up the void times. You get 3-4 hrs shifts at weird times of the day like 11-2 pm or 5-9 pm.  You only work drive thru and pick up. Full timers do everything else. If you want to be a pharmacy tech. Look elsewhere. This is a fast food job that gives out prescriptions. Long lines and prescriptions usually not ready when customers arrive. Extremely stressful for little pay.
bad,If I cannot say something nice I will not saying anything at all about CVS.  This was not a good fit for me and I would not recommend working there.  But people need to make their own decisions.
bad,"Great Customers, Register Purchases, Answer Phones, Help with Photo Machines, Stock Shelves. Clean.  Store Management was good.  Upper Management didn't really care it seemed.  Relied heavily on Customer Surveys that were not always accurate."
bad,"I love what I do as a pharmacist. I love the fact that I can go home care free. "
bad,"After 6 years, I find myself going from 37 hours a week with full time benefits to suddenly getting scheduled only 13-18 hours a week, thus losing health insurance in a few months!! But they claim they will be posting record profits?! At the expense of my family’s security! They use the slogan “we care” but it’s not about the ones who are the worker bees!!!! They care about the bottom line and not about employees. Or should I say.....”colleagues” 🤮"
bad,Never work here!! Management makes fun of employees clothing and calls them horrible names in cvs group chat very disgusting mean place to work I even had to anomously report the bullying of another coworker
bad,inexperienced and unorganized manager.  Always called you in to work despite your availability. managers talked behind coworkers backs. workspace always a mess.
bad,"A typical day at work is one with a large number of tasks for you to complete being tracked, timed, closely monitored, and flagged for incompletion. You will learn to multi-task and stay on your toes. Your pulse (according to any fitness watch) will average over 100 during your entire shift but you'll to function with it. You'll enjoy the people with which you work but will be saddened to see what the company does to them if you or they stick around too long (>5 years)."
bad,"CVS is a good company....to be a customer of. But in my experience, it was NOT a good company to be an employee at. They don't hire enough staff and expect employees to work beyond their scheduled time. Granted, I only worked at one store out of many, but that was my experience with the company,"
bad,cvs sets unrealistic goals for it employees without having the staff to fulfill customer needs on time.   working at cvs is like playing beat the clock
bad,".Very busy / understaffed"
bad,"- not enough help."
bad,The company is very unorganized which leads to a lot of unnecessary stress. The departments do not communicate well with each other well so sometimes you will be developing something that the company already has so you end up wasting 2 weeks of time.
bad,this job was a consistent work environment. i was able to gain great customer service when working here for over 3 years. i would recommend this job to anyone who wants a slow paced work flow.
bad,I don't want to give a bad review about the company as a whole only the department I worked in and it was through a temp agency. The manger was overwhelmed with her job so the job lacked everything
bad,"The Learning and Development department at CVS is poorly designed. There are not enough learning professionals. It's more an operational focus."
bad,"My team I work with is on manager#5 now within one year. They expect so much out of you, but then don't get compensated right. Now we have to use our break time to use the restroom, and if you can't wait that time is deducted from your actual break"
bad,"They speak of valuing diversity in the work place but it isn't there mission statement. There are a lot of situations that tends to get swept under the rug with this company that are very important. Employees are under payed and overworked. There is a lot of discrimination happening within this organization. Also in order to move forward in the company, relies more on who you know, not what you know or what you do."
bad,"As a manager I was averaging 70-75 hours per week to make up the difference of what could not be filled by other employees due to labor hours being cut back. The pharmacy would have anywhere from 3-5 employees working, but the front of store would have at least 3 hours a day with just one person and the remainder of the time with usually two. This allowed for little to no time to complete necessary and required work such as planograms, reports, stocking, truck breakdown, etc."
bad,"Unless you are walking into an executive position or some type of management your treatment is that of an outsider. Management rarely knows what's going on and annual layoffs in November keep everyone on edge and ruthless. Since no one knows who will be laid off you can be thrown under the bus or punished by management in attempts to keep themselves relevant and spot light you in a negative way. I've worked for both their headquarters and their warehouse and the atmosphere is disgustingly toxic. Save yourself the stress and aggravation and take a position somewhere less worried about their acquisition status and bottom dollar and more involved in their employees welfare. Also their benefits are terrible for a health care company, and grossly overpriced!"
bad,"overworked on daily functions, little to no job training, stressful culture and the customers are what keeps me there.  If it wasn't for them I would quit.Not to mention the pay really is a slap in the face.  I wish the District Manager would be more involved in promoting good people from within.  It seems like she does not care at all.  The company is not an equal opportunity company."
bad,"One of the most worst place to ever especially since it’s Bethesda, Maryland. The turnover rate is high and I can see why. Additionally, it took me 1 and 1/2 to get a decent raise. If you’re prone to get upset and angry I would avoid this place"
bad,There is no way to transfer stores. Tried to transfer and wasn't allowed. Only have you work to benefit the store at the current time. Don't have meetings with the team to find better solutions for the issues we encounter.
bad,No room for growth and average pay with supervisors who don't have answers for you. Will fire over a mix up with information given to HR on there behalf.  Supervisors are never around .
bad,"First I like being a pharmacy tech, the patients are very important to me! I  Pull meds for production, fill, answer phones, pick up, drive thru, sort, stock help with the truck. I am always doing CE  modules which is helpful. Hardest part of the job is the loudness due to a small work area. Also not receiving as much help or instructions that I need to move further. "
bad,"Certain Pharmacists belittle staff constantly, including in front of customers. No time to be trained correctly. Staff is forced to quit because the Pharmacy Manager doesn't allow technicians to transfer to different locations. Staff is hired and given 40 hours the first couple weeks and then cut to 9-25 hours. Never a consistent schedule or hours. Pharmacy Manager continues to hire more and more staff."
bad,I started out at CVS as Part time Pharmacy Technician. I went through tons of training only to be left at pickup checking out customers. I would think after all that training they would have room for advancement but no way. Management plays favoritism and sometimes only gave me 4 hours for the week when I was agreed for 24 hours a week. The job is a joke and was taken advantage of by starting at a only $12 an hour for a Pharmacy Technician when the going rate in NY is $16 at least. I would not recommend going for the Tech role as you are just running around by the other employees and don’t even have time to go to the bathroom they have you running around for them so much. Very poor work culture and no guidance for the employees as managers just tell everyone your business if you even trust them with anything confidential.
bad,In my time with CVS I found good heart workers but very isolated management. The over use of technology to accomplish daily task would rate 60% on a 100% scale.
bad,This is the first job ever in my life where you literally couldn’t go off memory everything changes each day or “As they go”! The management were extremely unprofessional I mean to the highest degree! They played favoritism a lot. It reminded me of high school. For the amount of stress you endure working with this company the pay should be higher as long with the amount of work you put in! Plus the 3 months of training with the most unprofessional trainer ever!!
bad,"Management doesnt work with employees mostly against them , needs longer breaks for those with health issues that are verified . Needs more positions that are flexible as far as hours"
bad,"typical corporate culture and very stressful and demanding work environment. "
bad,"I worked for this company for 2 years. The customers were rude, the pharmacist was a know-it-all that verbally abused his employees, and if you weren't of a certain minority, you didn't belong."
bad,"CVS has a lot of work to do on team building, management engagement, and salary. Benefits were also horrible, very expensive, and not enough coverage, especially for families."
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work with an excellent benefit package until Caremark (CMK) merged with CVS. Pay was cut for all new hires, paid vacation was reduced, and benefits package was completely gutted. Management changes focused on profits rather than providing good service to the patients."
bad,Not a bad company to work for at first pay is decent but not great for stress & workload given but the current management at this facility is kinda racist I feel. If you’re a minority there’s no room for growth. You’ll be treated unfairly and going to management won’t help. They lie to you at the interviews about schedule and the shifts are sometimes mandatory 9-10 hour shifts. Back end of pharmacy seems less stressful than the front end part but still no room for growth and less pay given and you’ll find more minorities so choose your position carefully.
bad,"At first it was intimidating, then it was tolerable, now it is unbelievably unprofessional and borderline abusive. Your store and store manager's actions will definitely differ from the CVS/Caremark policy. And you're likely to be shamed if you report these things even if they HEAVILY effect you. The customers can be absolutely lovely. This job is great for gaining experience in everything you can possibly imagine. However, be prepared to sacrifice something. Your time, your money, your sanity, something. Because, this job WILL suck the life out of you. It's a scam from an external consumer standpoint and an internal consumer standpoint. The fact that you get robbed frequently, will not even be your worst experience with this job."
bad,"No breaks, pharmacy is a mess; tons of training online, that they dont like to pay you for...I can't make this stuff up. Modern day slavery. One manager asked if I was full time or part time, because she could see I was pregnant. Then they skipped offering me benefits, even though I was full time. Pro - I received skills otherwise I may have to pay for; paid maternity leave. Cons - everything else you like about a normal job, this place is run like a fast food restaurant, you'll clean bathrooms."
bad,"The work load was generally too much for the staff. Turn over in employees, and inability to find coverage were the down falls. Very low pay for the work"
bad,"At CVS Health I would steer clear. There is no work life balance. You are underpaid based upon the amount of work that you are expected to do within a day or a week which was basically and physically impossible unless you worked 14 hours a day. The environment is high stress, cut throat, tension and numbers driven between the employees as well as the Management Team. The hardest part of the job is staying there longer than 6 months because of the working conditions long hours, high stress, poor management team. You would be better off taking a pay cut and working somewhere else that believes in equal work for equal pay."
bad,"high stress, not enough pay or benefits for how hard I work. my California cvs job was stressful just from being busy, my Washington cvs job has no staff, no manager, and I have been working like crazy and doing things on my own time at home to make the job easier for myself and co workers."
bad,"company does not care about their employers, only the customers and making as much money as they can. companies like them are they reason why genuine health care has declined."
bad,"Bad training, bad office politics, expensive benefits with sky high deductibles, long hours, and not enough pay to make up for it. You will be worked to the bone, and under-compensated for it."
bad,very stressful and busy always. when busy season ends no one gets hours. underpaid. not enough help. horrible company to work for.  we work very hard and all they care about is numbers and scores.
bad,"It's like a job at Burger King. It's for kids in school. Pay is a joke, managers are some kids that think they're gods and know everything. And whenever a new DM comes along they fire half the employees to make a impression on everyone"
bad,"Very fast paced but the company is not employee oriented. When an employee is old, the management team will kick them to the curve unless they are in a high management position."
bad,Pharmacy is the absolute worst place you would possible work in. You can never complete everything on time and you must be okay with this as you will be frequently understaffed.
bad,"This was an ok job, but there is no room for advancement. You are pretty much stuck int he same role. You will be ringing up people at the front end area and assisting the pharmacy people occasionally."
bad,Leadership lacked engagement with personnel. Unable to communicate with management regarding necessary changes that would benefit work environment. Management promoted based on personal feelings not work ethic.
bad,I work really hard in this place. sometimes more than its given and its not  appreciated. some days I work double shifts and about 12 hours days . its under paid and corporate is not understandable. have reached out to district numerous times and never received help.
bad,"If your desperate for an income, or happen to be looking for maybe a little extra income this isn't a bad choice, but don't expect to be able to live off of the money you make here. The raises in pay are none existing, the amount of work you do, and bull you put up with is not even close to being worth it."
bad,i didnt like it so much but it was a job and i worked it to the best of my abillity..................ill miss the customers but thats about it .....im a very friendly person but not everyone was
bad,"public restroom, major theft, no balance, unfriendly customers, horrible self service machines, 50% Discount, not enough staff, little organization .  ."
bad,"The pharmacy environment is a pretty decent place to work if you are lucky enough to work in the right store with the right managers. Upper management has steered away from caring about patients and more about how many prescriptions you can fill in an hour without bathroom breaks or lunches. With the right pharmacy staff however, it makes the environment tolerable especially in high volume areas where the customers are high maintenance and nasty to you. A lot of hours constantly being cut from the pharmacy staff budget, its barely worth it to get your license to only work 2 days a week or none at all unless you are the lead tech who is the only tech given full time."
bad,"i feel like there is too much to learn and at first one can get really confused about all the things that they have to get used to. it takes time to learn everything,"
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is developing relationships with the pharmacy patients we serve. Over the course of my time at this pharmacy I encounter the same faces and have developed solid relationships with many of the people we help. For me this is incredibly rewarding as we are able to help people become healthier and continue to stay on a path to good health.
bad,"I've made some great connections working at CVS for 3 years, thanks to the great group of people that I've worked with, I have very few good things to say about the higher up management team. There is so much pressure put on the pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to generate perfect scores for the store and the employees are tightly monitored with very low reward for good work, and terrible play, with not many benefits, and nowhere to go as a technician. Would not recommend a position at CVS to my friends."
bad,"Bad place for a pharmacy tech. Poor training, bad department management, and an environment of favoritism. Typical day for me meant running a register. Barely had a chance to fill prescriptions in the 3 yrs I worked there since I  was not considered part of the gang. I graduated top of my class with honors from 2 Pharmacy Technician schools. I became ill and underwent chemo and my hours were cut from 30 to 4 a week even though I was able to perform all of my duties. I was told by the scheduler that my hours were cut to accommodate the 2 temporary college students that were there for the summer."
bad,"This was my first job as a pharmacy tech"
bad,"There was never a set schedule. Times and days off would vary too much and as for a single parent, that was rough. There is a lot of knowledge to gain with regards to medications, side effects, what works and doesn't, and overall learning medical terminology. The workplace is chaos with the amount of customers per employee. CVS understaffs all locations with high expectations that is hard to obtain. It was hard to juggle all the tasks in one day when they are very strict with number of employees and no over time allowed. I did, however, enjoy the fast pace which made the day go by."
bad,"Caring for patient across the life span 18 months and above. Performs various physical exams, administers vaccines, treat acute and chronic illness, interpret diagnostic testing, provide annual wellness screenings, smoking cessation and travel health visits."
bad,"The pay is good if you are brought in on Contract from a job placement program. Not alot of on the job training. Training consist of 2 weeks in a room with no ""in the moment"" questions and then 1 day of training with your lead, then put at your own desk and given patients to work with. Not alot of assistance when questions are asked"
bad,It is a thankless job.  I enjoy working with people.  I enjoy being a manager but at CVS Health everything is a fire drill.  I never get a lunch and as a salaried employee there is no regard for personal time.
bad,"This is the most unorganized company and pharmacy manager I have ever worked for.  Management is terrible!  Work environment created by the manager is one of backstabbing and distrust.  Don't waste your time, unless you want a going no where job.  Save yourself"
bad,"The work site itself isnt bad. It's got a tennis court, a gym, a cafeteria. The bad part is, you'll never get to use any of these unless you live onsite, or very very near by. "
bad,"They play favorites with their employees, make promises they cannot keep, and overall expect too much from their employees than one person can handle (in the pharmacy). They reward the employees that tarnish their image."
bad,"This company used to be a great company to work for, however in recent years it has been all about the numbers. There is no compassion for its employees"
bad,If I have nothing to say. I didn't learn much. Typical day was busy. Co workers didn't really talk to you there is nothing too much more I have to say
bad,"Typical day: Do everyone else's work and your own, get yelled at for no reason."
bad,"insufficient pay and lack of opportunity. there was very little structure or organization to the company, making it difficult to complete your job functions accurately and efficiently."
bad,"A typical day at work was very crazy. It was too busy for just one store in our town.  It was the only 24 hour pharmacy around. Customers would be told it would take a couple hours for their prescription to be finished and when they came back it still wasn't done. It was very stressful because the customers would get mad. I don't blame them for being mad. I would be too. All in all, it wasn't a very good company to work for"
bad,"Great company, but in Savannah, GA the district managers its as nice as she should be.. Store managers at all locations has very nasty attitudes, doesn't let you call out if your mother or kids has to be admitted to the hospital.. I don't recommend any location in Savannah,"
bad,This company sucks they treat there employees badly. Management showed favoritism to certain co workers. Typical day at work busy everyday I learned nothing some co workers weren't helpful.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of standing at the registers and hearing customers complaining that the shelves are empty and that they don't want to use the express checkouts. Shift supervisors are at each other's throats, complaining and spreading rumors about each other. The associates work well together since we all hate management, therefore there aren't any brown nosers. The hardest part of the job is having to put a fake smile and pretending to care about the sales or the numbers. The enjoyable part is when you get to leave and never look back."
bad,"A terrible company that tries to squeeze every penny and every drop of effort out of everything and everyone."
bad,liked my job but didn't like the way I had to do it.could not do my job when others werenot doing theirs.poor management.lack of support.had fun doing my job sometimes.very hard work.heavy lifting.
bad,"Omnicare promotes technicians to manage departments that a capable pharmacist should be in charge of. Which is clearly a huge mistake, to have a pharmacy technician be in charge when you have a pharmacist in the department. Hopefully CVS will rectify some of the ridiculous mistakes made by Omnicare. I was very good employee and was let go because of some of the poor decisions made by a technician who was promoted to a position a pharmacist should have had. Omnicare does not care about their employees. I promise you, you will be disappointed before long if you accept a job there."
bad,"Little training given. What is taught via online modules is ineffective. Most of what is learned comes directly from working on the job. However, while there are some individuals who want to help one navigate the many technicalities of working in a pharmacy, most of the veteran staff who has been for a year or longer does not want to help those who are new to the job and this particular work environment. CVS needs to reevaluate and change how it trains its pharmacy employees."
bad,"A busy work environment, mostly for customer service. "
bad,They had a hostile work conditions that did not care about the well being of there employees.  They had bad management. I did not like going to work.
bad,"While I enjoy some of my colleagues' company as well as my pharmacists', the CVS as a whole has misplaced priorities. I work in this field to help patients, CVS enforces many time consuming and useless computer tasks that negatively impact the care of our patients. I am continuously hearing patients say, ""I'm moving to a different pharmacy,"" and I have to admit, I would too."
bad,"good workplace, good schedule, good environment and benefits and eager to learn new daily basis.. make u punctual and good employee"
bad,"Not the greatest place to work at but I did build my customer Service skills here."
bad,It was smooth running just wasn't a lot of teamwork within the store.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to this place unless they really needed a job.
bad,As a employee I do a little bit of everything and don't get paid enough to do all the extra work. Also management isn't fair with equaling out the shifts and hours. They just don't care for the employees.
bad,"learn a lot about insurance ,billing,customer service . and a typical day of work"
bad,"Let me tell you Omnicare to manage people you need to be smart and have some skills. It is just bunch of insecure co-workers and poor poor management. However, if you love to run to your supervisor office and kiss it all the time you may be recognized. It is just unbelievable"
bad,"Work in a very busy / challenging environment where you have to be on your toes all day. Job calls for real time pressure handling & improvisation to dissipate it."
bad,"They were lacking to keep up with the Pharmacy industries standards,and the old;they didn't practice what they explained to be company  procedure,policies,rules and regulations definitely applies for them.Their employees generally had a bad attitude,not very good representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.Very busy,mismanaged and under staffed most days,data entry systems mismanaged,etc...and I found several locations to be that way."
bad,"every job has its ups and downs, as well as its downfalls and well CVS is no different"
bad,"Answered in-bound calls, data entry prescription information, verified doctor prescriptions, cashier, inventory management, order management, and computer skills"
bad,"Seriously, do not work here unless you are ok with zero advancement, poor management, poor training and favoritism. I have had nothing but problems working here. The work is mundane and boring. Not for someone who is ambitious and craves more out of their career. Ok for college students looking to break into the healthcare/customer service field. Do not get comfortable here. No challenges. Gets you by day to day. Thankful for that."
bad,"The way CVS is set up is not employee friendly. They over work the people they have then cut hours even more. I can understand why customers get upset, because they are very understaffed for the work load. We would get so busy that it was almost insulting to ask for a break, just to have the hours cut... Again. Not only that, but I was severely underpaid to put up with all the garbage they give you. I was constantly stressed out. They care about numbers, not the satisfaction of the customers or employees."
bad,"I've learned a lot from past manager how to do price changes,put stock away,log in venders,I was hired as a photo lab supervisor and learned a lot there are so much to learn in photo and was so much fun to learn, my co worker are really friendly and we work together to get things done. The hardest part of the jobis to learn all the things in Photo at first but the manager at the time said to my I know you could do this job great and I did and had fun learning the job. It was great to have a great team in the photo lab they learned well and did a great job helping the customers"
bad,"Helping Customers all day whether it be cashing them out or helping them find a product."
bad,"A typical day at work here was bickering and bantering back and forth between people, he said, she said, people playing each other against each other day after day..Very stressful and not a good environment to be in. The best part of my job was interacting with the customers.  I enjoy helping people."
bad,"Worked for over two years, promised for over a year for advancement and nothing. Gave that company my all, worked my hands to the bone. Then dropped like a ton of bricks. I've done many a trade in my life, hard physical jobs like brick laying and concrete pouring, the managment treat you like meat and they know your replaceable and treat you like it. Two-faced people, would never go back inside a store to buy anything. Would never work for them again, no matter what the pay."
bad,was glad to leave. horrible work experience. there's nothing more to tell
bad,"No chance to advance. Overall okay place of employment. Management is wishy washy.  People become ""targets"" very easily unless you suck up to certain people."
bad,No room for advancement and compensation very low. Management is not at a top level. Employees are not appreciated.
bad,"***BEWARE***The hardest part of this job is dealing with the unethical practices internally. You are roped in by being told that there are great growth opportunities, when in reality the upper managers and director already have a ""friend"" in mind for the role. In addition there is ZERO accountability for some of the poor decisions made in the Nashville site. If you ask legitimate questions LOOKOUT ...your ""Nashville Career"" is OVER. The culture and morale is in disarray. In addition, there is no outlet...if you speak to HR or the Ethics line your issue or concern is swept under the carpet because no one follows up or through. Benefits and Vacation time were reduced. God forbid if you are a Supervisor, they are expected to do miracles! If you can't operate in a stale & stagnant environment AND carry the world on your shoulders for low wages...then this is not the place for you."
bad,very disorganized company. Does not like to give hours or pay to employees
bad,Very long days average 60 to 75 hours a week on the road.
bad,open in the AM there is 1 staff member and 1 member of management.
bad,great place to intern for but when it comes down to the hiring process they will BS with you big time...
bad,They do not care about their employees and never give raises that are promised.
bad,its a good place for a started to gain experience but I don't see much progression there career wise.
bad,• Lead fellow technicians and keep up with due tasks and due courses
bad,After working for the company for a little over a year and even driving to nearby locations (30 miles) to fill in I never recieved an annual raise. I have excellent work ethics so had to leave this company because of pay and no room for advancement.
bad,Processed checks from a lockbox and applied to appropriate accounts.
bad,management did not treat those with respect. Was not much room to grow. compounding areas were not sterile. Expectations of employees were unrealistic. We were also asked to do jobs not required in our field such as warehouse work. i personally did not enjoy Omnicare at all.
bad,"Receive first delivery evry morning at 8am sharp, then receive shipments as they were delivered throughout the day."
bad,management is abusive and plays favorites. Company does not value the employees and only cares about the bottom line. They make promises and don't keep them.
bad,To be honest it's a very stressful job. I am looking for something else because of recent events that have happened.
bad,"Don’t stick around too long. Poor work life balance. Non-responsive upper management. You can do better elsewhere. Big talk up front about the opportunities but little efforts to uphold their promises. Everyone is a grunt just there to throw a truck or run a register, all two of you on schedule at any given time of day."
bad,"If it is your intent to go to a fortune 7 and be mentored by innovative, brilliant professionals- look elsewhere. With that said, managers are knowlegable and professional. The ones that move ahead are 100% focused on excelling and working 60-70 hours a week. Culture is cold and unforgiving of mistakes or dissent. Blows my mind that such a lack of leadership exists in the fortune 7."
bad,Upper management sucked. There never scheduled enough employees for the amount of scripts we had to fill. Our store was extremely busy and I've floated around to other stores and we were very efficient. Just not enough hours given.
bad,Typical retail pharmacy job.  Customer Service driven with advanced adherence protocols. Increased prescription numbers with little support and not enough tech hours.
bad,"CVS has flexible hours & various locations. Little to no advancement in career options. Fair pay rates are severely lacking & little to no room in the budget for more than 2 people to work at a time, staffing is a huge issue."
bad,"You're underpaid for the work you do. "
bad,They need a whole new management team and pharmacy is drowning because they don't know how to help their employees. The work isn't bad at all but the manager plays favorites.
bad,"Management is terrible, specifically At the bee cave location but I’ve met a few other managers and was very disappointed with them as well. They give cashiers the responsibility of running the register, photo booth, taking inventory, putting up labels and promotional display, stock shelves and coolers, and take passport photos, completely by yourself, until another employee comes in for the 3-10 shift , all for $11 an hour and extreme stress, long paragraphs of your list of “things to do” that day while also doing the job you were actually hired for, and then check back in by texting your manager because he is never actually in the store helping you he’s either on vacay with his girlfriend for the 3rd month in a row or at home, checking in at another store but very rarely do you actually see your manager while at work . Just terrible all around the only pros were the other girls (only girls were hired the whole time I worked there too..) but they were great until they decided they couldn’t work there any longer just like I did. Hope this helps!"
bad,"Most members of field leadership are amateurs with pharmacy degrees that were in the right place at the right time.  If you’re lucky enough to have an exception to that rule, as your leader, you’re golden but chances are, your boss will either be a boys club racist or a cute pharmacist only concerned in their self interest.  Always watch your back because it’s harder than you think to tell the difference."
bad,Ok Company does not offer more staff and hours to give too many responsibilities for only two people in the building. But management will help you if you need time off.
bad,One of the associate manager is rude and doesn’t know how to speak to customers nor employees. If it’s not her way it’s no way. Management let’s he slide with everything she does.
bad,"I was hired on as a part time employee. Started working 40 hours a week. Still DON'T have benefits some how."
bad,"I used to love my job as a tech but cvs went through a lot of changes and caused a lot of people to quit. The people who work in the stores aren’t the problem. The rules we have to follow make it impossible to give perfect customer service, and that’s what is important."
bad,This place was the worst place I have ever worked.  My supervisor was mean and rude was only there to ruin people’s lives   The managers in every department were never willing to listen to any new ideas or advice and played favorites
bad,"Bullies were allowed to exist. Also, a tremendous amount of red tape to do your job. You are awakened in the middle of the night-- even if your assistance was not needed."
bad,Upper management shows no type of respect for anyone else. The employees are overworked and under paid. Customer of the pharmacy sometimes do not have a choice to change pharmacies because of insurance and they honestly despise CVS
bad,"This place is kind of a sham.. The boss only does the minimum, and allows the managers to act like children and treat young adults like theyre less than them."
bad,"I thought this job was going to be so great. At our orientation, we listened for 8 hours about how great CVS Caremark is. We were told it was flexible, reliable, and they understand that life happens. By the time we were out of training, I was already done with the place. I understand it’s a call center and we can’t take the calls to heart, but being called a “bad person” and being told that I’m the reason people are unable to get their medications is hard. It’s a very heavy job. Having to go into work in fear that you’ll be fired because you didn’t recap whether a medication was a tablet or a capsule is by far the most stressful thing. And the Supervisors are either great or downright disappointing. They are rarely there because they’re too busy going out and getting lunch instead of managing their employees. The other departments that you have to transfer to give so much pushback and honestly don’t want to do their jobs, even the Call Resolution Team, who are there to HELP. The only upside would be the coworkers. There are some really great people that work at Caremark but it doesn’t make up for all the negatives. I could honestly say that working for Caremark has not given me a good impression and I have been looking for other jobs since before I got out of training."
bad,"The thing that makes working here so hard is that there is no real management within the Pharmacy Department. The pharmacy technicians due all the leg work and the Pharmacist does the end work. The Pharmacist acts as a buffer with management leaving you no real place to go if there is an issue with a pharmacist."
bad,"Changes every day, no communication with management, favorites are promoted, chaotic workplace, too high of demands, expects workers to be robots, no support."
bad,"It was a training store for management. There was a new assistant manager every few weeks/months, some moved up the corporate ladder, others left CVS entirely. It was a store with what was meant to be a solid store culture of ""everybody working together"" but as time went on, new faces came and caused serious disruptions in the normal cycle of things."
bad,I had a situation once started my pay reflected on my experience after my 90 days i wasnt offered mt pay raise. I was told it was a accident on there part.In which in orientation. Depending on your experience that each pay wouldnt be the same. Had issue wit a employee. Constantly harassing me. Brought it to the supervisor and assistant. I was told by the supervisor that employee was a prpblem starter  in which she called a made a false statement to get me fired. Reported i was harassing her in which i didnt tall wit her. Therr decision was shocking to me. Im ok that im nolonger with this company and i will never recommend this company to any one.
bad,"Rude, cliquish, and only good for a small time. For the short time i worked there, the training was winged, management was immature, and employees were treated as disposable."
bad,"I loved being a pharmacy technician, I loved my regular customers and the duties I performed. What I didn't like, however, was the vast amount of stress put on me not only by rude and unruly customers, but the unsupportive (also stressed) management. You have to beg to get a decent raise and the company forces you to continually harass it's customers with phone call ""reminders"". Keep in mind, you also have to do all of the other work while also making these phone calls daily, dealing with customer issues, AND them cutting hours for not only technicians but the pharmacists too!"
bad,There are more managers than employees and work still doesn’t get done? Managers are horrible and lazy. Everybody has the “wasn’t my shift” mentality and will leave their mess and disorganization for next shift to do.
bad,"Learned a lot about how the Pharmacy/Insurance industry needs extreme regulations, penalties and oversight."
bad,i hated it  they got mad at me for losing stuff that they actually lost and it was a lot of complicated stocking the cashier part was the easiest part but taking passport photos kinda sucked.
bad,Overall management at CVS is top-heavy with lots of managers.  Turnover rate was very high.  Management is unconcerned with needs of employees.  Pay is exceptionally poor for such a large corporation.
bad,Management operates based on seniority. Not much room to grow without a few years on the job. Work speed varies depending on the time. Lack of communication/ team work amongst superiors yet the job manages to get done at the end of the day. Getting days off gets difficult. Good for new or unemployed workers looking for work.
bad,Needs superior management skills. Poor communication an respect between management and colleagues. Overtime mandatory and underpaid reps. I'm happy atmosphere
bad,Manager not cooperative and had a poor attitude toward employees and customers. Little assistance given by management to help learn operation of store.
bad,"Insurance was terrible.  Tried to work around my other job but didn't succeed.  Doesn't like for employees to ask off for family time.  If you want a job there, think first."
bad,"Horrible management. High turn over rate. Low pay. Was only allowed part time so no benefits. Very hostile work environment. Verbal abuse directed at both technicians and patients by head pharmacist. They frown upon devoting too much time to patients. Too much time being anything over 2 minutes. Pharmacist often got aggravated at any requests for consultation. A get in, get out situation. I trained at a different location and the atmosphere was completely different. Wish I could have remained there."
bad,"The day starts with hellos from everyone. Updates on issues that may get passed along, and lots of communication and working together for problem resolution."
bad,"always short staffed in technicians & pharmacists, making it virtually impossible to complete required tasks on a daily basis while being constantly interrupted with phone calls.   Also would not give raises and had to fill in at other stores to get necessary number of hours."
bad,After a year of working with CVS Health you get paid time off and a week of paid vacation. The co workers are okay. However the store manager has poor management skills.
bad,The upper management there is horrible.  The turnover is extremely high.  They are always holding training classes because nobody wants to stay.  They can constantly move you from team to team. No consistency
bad,CVS allows bad Managers to reign and run off good quality workers.  There is no job development and very few opportunities for advancement. Managers hire for loyalty instead of skill or quality.
bad,"Please give up your days off to have meetings, complete modules, and go into work to get caught up so you can provide service to the company. Please be part of our leaders program you will just need to use your vacation days to do so."
bad,No growth and there is a lot of favoritism. They don't teach you and expect you to know everything. The training sucks and everyone seems to be in a bad mood majority of the time . Thought I could grow but total the opposite.
bad,The managers are immature and you won't get paid the hours you're worked they lie to you it's always them against everyone else working there not a good work environment
bad,As a company they cannot figure out how to keep the stores stocked with product.  The Pharmacies are so under staffed that it is impossible to safely take care of patient needs.
bad,"poor pay, can never get a set schedule so home/work life balance is nearly impossible, depending on what store your at management is different and each manager has different rules as to what they expect. its hard to get fired from cvs so you have to deal with people showing up late everyday, not doing their job or being VERY SLOW at it and it being ok with management."
bad,"After the Aetna acquisition, corporate lost track of their so called mission. Store and pharmacy tech hours were slashed while expectations, became higher than ever. Little to no help from leadership, district leaders, or corporate. One by one store employees kept leaving before new hires could be trained. CVS needs to take a hard look at what REALLY happens in stores and realizes though the employee pool is constantly a revolving door, they are losing their best quality employees by treating them poorly"
bad,It starts out well and you’re just overwhelmed but you just go with it. They only care about metrics and nothing more. You are nothing but an ID number. The customers are the worst and CVS brings in new things that just make life worse for the workers and they just don’t care.
bad,"The minute you enter the door, until you walk out at the end of your shift (which you are never able to leave on time), it is non-stop. Too many metrics to follow which almost makes it hard to show genuine concern to customer or to provide good service. Hardly have time to take lunch or even step out to take a bathroom break."
bad,"As a Pharmacy Tech, the hours were long with no breaks other than 1/2 lunch.  It was a Sweatshop and there was a Revolving door. Management doesn't care about work/life balance. No respect for their employees. Micro-managed til the day I left. Belmont, NC 24HR STORE Pharmacy management was brutal and atrocious."
bad,"I really enjoyed working at CVS and had hoped to retire from there until I ended up under Danielle Blosser's management. She is very deceiving and a bully. I feel CVS knows she is a issue when you see how many people quit under her management. I never got an increase under her management and we worked months without a supervisor and still get our numbers up. I got called a cheat because I went over my production and given a failed score for punishment. , and I went to her boss and again nothing so I felt I was being pushed out so I quit."
bad,"In 2008 when I first began working for CVS, advancements, raises, morale, and care from the company was decent. Two or three years later there was a huge change."
bad,"While a lot of the employees are great, most of the store managers are not. You can get fired for anything and everything but yet they need the people so the good people are fired while the bad ones aren't. The store managers have a habit of calling an employees at 3am and constantly change your hours at the drop of a hat."
bad,"I worked for cvs about ten years. And i understood the job demanded great deal of patience and sympathy. But you'd think the management would appreciate the employees hard work? Never. "
bad,hardest part of this job is dealing with customers who talk to you like your beneath them an have little to no respect for you what so ever an you have to smile and suck it up because its your job.
bad,Employees are stressed to take on more tasks than manageable and do not receive any additional compensation for these tasks. Employees are madated to work 50-60 hour weeks due to lack of planning for busy seasons. Employees are undertrained but expected to know skills outside of what they are trained to do. All of this is masked by the fact that their employees are promoted within the company to positions outside of what they are trained or skilled for.
bad,"This company has a lot of job opportunities but it is a very stressful and un-organized work environment. The management are very different, some can stay on top of things and seem to know what they are doing but the others give you wrong information, don't know how to help or you can't even find them half the time to help. The benefits are very good but it is not worth the stress."
bad,"For a company that cares about helping people, they sure do not care about their front store employees. I have been forced to stay and work past my scheduled hours many a times. My store manager and district leader were best friends, so no matter how horrible she treated her employees, it was overlooked. Its a company about who you know and how much they can squeeze out of you. Once you draw a line, they will replace you and slave the next person. Would not recommend this job if you have a family or if you have any self value. Work there for a PT overnight. They will leave you alone."
bad,"My time spent at CVS was very up and down over the 4 years that I have spent there. It started off as a good career to have, especially for somebody like myself who is just beginning their work career coming out of high school. However, a couple of promotions and a change of management has caused an overwhelming amount of stress. A passive aggressive type of culture does not work in a pharmacy. The best part of the job is knowing that I can be making a difference in the life of our patients by helping them improve their overall health. The worst part of the job is the constant stress of needing to get certain things accomplished with little to no help."
bad,"You would think after 17 years the company would give you a break. Wrong. Please look elsewhere for a job. CVS will work you to deth, you are just a cog in the machine."
bad,"The only reasons I am contempt with work is the interactions and relationship I have with customers to better assist them with their needs in the store. And sometimes, the employee problem solving related to work and outside work also makes me feel need to be there."
bad,"Warning now stay away unless you are desperate. Been here for a couple of years and watched about 100 people come and go the turn over rate is extremely high, and thats including management(which they cannot seem to keep). Training is less than none and MANAGEMENT just dont care about you at all. Im only still here to build up my resume. The drama in this place is outrageous!!! Your eyed down/stalked/followed like prey and can't even use the restroom without being asked where you went. Oh and I cant forget to mention they make up their own rules outside of CVS. If you desperately need a job then to each their own, but dont say I didnt warn you!!!!"
bad,Working at CVS is a decent job for those looking to start there work history. It isn’t a place to pay a mortgage take care of a family and being independent is very difficult.
bad,"The new culture at CVS/Health is ""Do more work with less help"".  Since acquiring Aetna for $69 Billion, all costs have been slashed below what is acceptable to fill Rx's in a SAFE AND TIMELY manner. My store fills approximately 1750 rx's/week and the technician help has been cut back so far that I am not only the Pharmacist for my 12-hour shift, but I am also the PRIMARY DRIVE-THRU CASHIER for 9.5 of those hours!  Makes it pretty difficult to get my Pharmacist work done in timely or safe manner.  They set you up for failure.  It seems as if you are an experienced Pharmacist making a decent wage, they make it more difficult on you so that you leave so they can then hire younger, new graduates for much less money?????"
bad,"I feel I was fired unreasonably, I have back problems and it slows me down. I understand the rate its fine but even if I pushed through the pain I couldn't get close to the minimum rate at all. in time maybe I could have but 2 weeks before my 90 days I get fired. for having a 70. I had management watch me and told me I ran an 88. he gave me pointers and I applied them. it helped a bit. it was usually 83 degrees on the ground floor. I worked on the 3rd near the roof. in a shift, I would drink 7 to 10, 16oz bottles of water a day. that caused me to use the bathroom pretty regularly. in return would lower my rate. the bathroom was 3 to 5 min away depending on what line I was on. in the rate meeting we had they say you can accumulate 2min of bathroom time by the end of your shift. my overall experience at CVS warehouse was a so-so type of feeling. I enjoyed the job and I love physical work and the workout was nice. but the push was a bit much. management don't really care. as long as it's not going to affect the company your just a number and part of a machine that can be replaced. they gave me no heads up or warning. I was working a line 30 min before the end of the shift and got pulled to the office and was told I wasn't up to standards and that I was terminated and had to sign and date a paper. I used to be a manager for years I get it. I learned more as a manager then working at CVS. CVS are worried about CVS. sure they throw you some healthcare you have to pay for. if they got rid of the rate I think it could be a 5-star job. and stop trying to 1 up by getting rid of someone"
bad,very stressful work environment...very goal oriented company with unrealistic goals...understaff to meet the goals they required...high turnover in pharmacist and technicians positions..very
bad,You don't get 40 hours a week and the health insurance covers nothing. You pay over 4000 a year for nothing. You need a second job to make up for hours
bad,"Company mostly cares about sales and numbers not patient care, very high paced and expectations are very high with minimum recognition, hour cuts and slot of work for the number of employees on team."
bad,It was an okay job but not for me. Slowest and boredom job ever. The manager wasn’t even there like that. Although it was a clean environment and everything in place.
bad,"In the store I worked in for 28 yrs they employed 2 individuals that ended driving out myself and another long term employee, these individuals were caught doing an illegal thing and were not even wrote up that basically did it for me"
bad,"Lack of communication between management and supervisors, lack of communication with management and employees, very cut throat, lack of trust in ability to do tasks assigned, horrible work/life balance, stressful environment due to management/supervisors"
bad,"I love my co workers"
bad,"CVS cares more about the bottom line then employees or customers. If you work there you will receive little compensation for the work you are expected to complete. In addition you are expected to complete training modules while on the job, but it is impossible to do so because there are so many of them."
bad,"I really like helping people, that is the main reason I stay there. You develop friendships with customers and it makes you smile when you see them out side of cvs and they come up to you and talk with you,"
bad,I was really excited when I got the Job as a Pharmacy Technician as CVS but the company did not live up the my expectations. It's so bad that the store where I work has a very high turn over rate. The amount of stressed that you are put under versus your compensation is not worth it
bad,The management  was unprofessional and did not know what  they were doing. Communication was poor and scheduling was a nightmare. Blind  leading blind
bad,Overall CVS offers a structured work environment in their buildings.  depending on the management the environment can change drastically.  Employee retention is not important to upper management.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone works for CVS on a store level. The employees aren't treated with the upmost respect, and no matter your position with CVS, if they feel like you aren't needed anymore, they will let you go."
bad,Its a pleasure working for cvs.  Ive learned alot in my months of being there.  unfortunately there is hardly no hours given to employees so people have to see places for employment.
bad,I personally did not enjoy working for CVS. I was not getting enough hours or getting paid enough to cover all of my living expenses. I was constantly having to work at other stores way out of the way just to get enough hours to pay my bills
bad,"They don't care about their employees. They set crazy expectations and expect their employees to meet them. If you do not meet them, do not plan on being employed for very long. It is like a revolving door and employees are constantly being fired or quit due to the stress of the job."
bad,"When addressing a problem with employee, supervisors  are not willing to help solve the problem  only sending you to other people .  This company dosn't treat their employees take the time to correct issues in the work area."
bad,"Lets be realistic, the job isnt that bad, helping members with benefit and insurance questions is pretty easy. however their is little advancement, moving from one department to another isnt advancement. The call center rifles through employees like changing your underwear. People get hired between June and the end of the year, and of all the people hired maybe 20% stay. Management is horrible, if your not your managers favorite you have very little change of going anywhere. Their day is filled with meetings and walking around the office, very little interaction with them unless your getting in trouble or doing something wrong. The only nice thing about working here is the mount of PTO time you get, its extremely flexible and you get a decent amount of it yearly."
bad,"I don't have very much to say, they just don't care if you live or die and no consideration for single moms. I was hardworking and dependable, but the manager just wanted to work you and no consideration what so ever"
bad,"Most managers are nice but if you have to call out sick you are out of luck. They don't give sick days and make you work bad hours while putting most of the responsibility on you. My store manager would schedule me to be the opening manager for the front of the store and then he would tell me that I had to work as a pharmacy technician in the pharmacy for 6 hours in the middle of my shift manager shift leaving me with only 2-3 hours to actually do my shift manager job. Giving the amount of time I had to complete my 8 hours of manager tasks for the day and stop every minute to go back up front to help the cashier it left everyone unhappy. Customers would have to wait in the pharmacy because they would only staff one technician (me) with the pharmacist on duty and only one cashier in the front. Makes it impossible for anyone to actually do any of their jobs. Got really tired of being treated like that and being forced to unload truck at 3am in the middle of a various dangerous area by myself (female) while having to leave the receiving doors open because all of the pallets wouldn't even fit in the backroom. Do not recommend if you even want to spend any time with any family over even 1 holiday, I was forced to work all holidays. Would be nice to have a work 3 holidays get one off type thing."
bad,This is not a place to work and advance unless you're friends with management. They lay people off and expect the ones who are left to pick up the slack. It's just impossible.
bad,"Overworks their employees with out equivalent pay.  Poor work/life balance, I worked 80 hours one week here.  Poor opportunity for advancement.  Had management asking me how to perform duties at one point of my employment."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had simply due to the lack of professionalism of coworkers. The high paced volume and long hours would be more manageable had there been a more respectful atmosphere among the coworkers. If you are looking for a job in the health field where you can really take the time to care for your patients, this is not the place for you."
bad,"I believe some people in CVS Health's management team expect too much out of their cashiers/stockers.  I wouldn""t encourage others looking for this specific position to work here."
bad,"...and that’s putting it politely. After almost 7 years I feel unappreciated and still at the bottom of the totem pole, so to speak. Poor scheduling, management, no respect or communication..."
bad,"Being a receiving tech means any drugs that came in to the building would be handled and put away by me, with little to no help (which I was told I would have during the hiring process.) I have been at this company for roughly 10 months and have already witnessed two layoff's with rumor of more to come."
bad,"Only good thing is that they offer health care benefits for full time employees. The company will try to hire you at the lowest rate possible and will only give you a raise of a few cents an year(not exaggerating), so try to negotiate your rate prior to hire because they will only cut your hours, not pay you more. Upper management has no management skills. Just acts as a puppet of corporate and does useless conference calls while their employees suffer with problems of being understaffed, hours cut, but workload growing day by day. Our store level managers pressured everyday and stays over many hours to pick up the load but look depressed. We've had change in store managers 3 times in the past year because they keep quitting. Company reminds me of the new Blade Runner."
bad,The management shows no respect for anyone. The ones that need to be disciplined or in some cases fired never get in trouble it's always the ones that try to make it a little better and put in more effort that get in trouble!!
bad,Working at CVS was only ever going to be a temporary job until I got a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  I did not want to spend the rest of my life working for them.
bad,"they will promise you 40+ hours a week you will be lucky to get 20.  they will cut your hours without warning, you can go in to work on your scheduled day to work to find out they gave your shift to someone else. they will belittle you and make you feel like dirt."
bad,"The current head pharmacist talks down to customers and employees. Workers are filled with childish drama, which makes it difficult to enjoy the work environment. Nothing gets done, we receive no breaks, and the district manager does not support us."
bad,"stressful place in retail pharmacy, bad software .started as intern and worked as staff Pharmacist after working for 1 years i have to move to other retail pharmacy."
bad,"having a large team and multiple managers that work for me, it is rewarding when you help someone achieve their career aspirations or help them through difficult times to ultimately put them in a better and stronger place at the end."
bad,"Working here is great to get your foot into the door into a leadership group. Nonetheless, once you are in a role it is difficult to move up within management."
bad,Management only looked at the bottom line - no room for suggestion or growth. Poor business practices and there was no proper training. Supervisors didn't support their teams.
bad,Its a ok job a.its varies for location to location how the management treat employees if they dont like u they cut your hours..if u full time they can cut hours to part time
bad,"High stress,  not paid enough for the all work that you do. company cares more about making money and pushing vaccines on patients than they care about its employees and patient care. never shown appreciation by the company."
bad,I do not wish to answer this question or give much thought to it - I did not like the work like balance too many hours were expected of me - many nights and weekends
bad,A poorly managed pharmacy can lead to stressful times. Entirely understaffed with corporate increasingly cutting hours.  It could be a good place with proper leadership.
bad,Overall a good benefits and salary package. Everyone's experience would vary from department to department. I would have liked more chances to improve my skills and a work life balance. Bottom line driven company. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work there and get to know so many hard working people. Once the regime changes it will be a great place to work too I'm sure.
bad,"Employees work 12-16 hours a day including on call on weekend without pay (exempt employee), no work/life balance. New leadership took a well working department with 98% accuracy apart to spread the knowledge and improve processes in other departments, however, because this was done abruptly, it only resulted in process failure and more errors all across the company."
bad,"This was a great job if you want fast cash, they offered a lot of overtime so I did make amazing money. But they hire only through agencies so that they don't have to over benefits and advancement in the work place. Not to mention no paid time off and no sick time. They have a fast turn around rate, everyone I knew was only there for 6 months or less. The management and work flow was the worst, they had very lazy employees and lazy management."
bad,CVS Health needs better management. The pay is not worth the amount of time you put in to your job .I would recommend going to a company that appreciates your work ethics. And that is going to pay more.
bad,"First off, my project manager @ CVS ROC was GREAT! For the entire year+ I worked at the ROC, I worked with basically the same project manager. We made the ROC great again! However, I feel I was the exception to the rule, and I was allowed much more freedom than the average (temp) worker would ever be allowed. With that freedom, I felt I was able to do some cool things, none of which stuck around, but during the time I was doing them, it was great. However, as fun at times as that first go 'round, I would never go back there for anything. Top management was not open to change of any type. Once my temporary work ended, I applied for another permanent position with the company. Over two weeks went by waiting for an answer after my interview, which I thought went very well. In that time I found a much better job and CVS is ancient history now. To this day, I have nothing against CVS. It's only because they didn't want me that I have the great job I have today!"
bad,It's a call center and the call volume was always high. Managers treated their employees unfair and were very rude. Constance drama every day. Each day was a stressful day at work. I wouldn't advise anyone that I know to work there.
bad,"Very unorganized, stressful, no room for advancement a lot of brown nosing, hours are okay. If you your going to work there you can't  have a mind of your own. "
bad,"I was there for 18 months, while it started out great, it eventually went downhill from there, work hours went through the roof  for over a year, sometimes being stuck working 14 days of 12hour shifts in a row, while training was ok and i learned a lot of their departments, it was the refusal to pay me that finally ended my time there, i left in May of 2017, is is now September 2017, and i have yet to recieve the 47 hours of pay they took from me."
bad,"I wouldnt go back. The management is lacking the hours are cut weekly, the higher ups take what you say about work and the environment then forget about it as soon as they step out of the store. I felt undermind and pushed aside while i was there."
bad,"I loved working at CVS, it a very fast paced environment. If you love helping people and working in a fast paced atmosphere then this is the job for you. The pay does not go with the amount of work that you have to do, which definitely changed."
bad,"A typical day involved assisting the pharmacist counting prescriptions, insurance approval, directing customers on how to take prescribed medications, and inventory"
bad,"Very clique based place"
bad,"typical work place come to work,work and go home pay is low no benifits no advansement. work like a dog no one cares all they care about is making money they say we are helping patients with their health but it is about making money for corporate. standing on your feet all day.pharmacicts do not stay long on the job they are rotated every 6 to 8 months."
bad,"The attitude has shifted from being about taking care of the patients to focusing on the bottom line and the money. I no longer feel that as a company they are focused on patient care and their treatment of employees isn't much better. They cap the salaries and don't expect employees to stay 15-20 years as they get too expensive. It may be different in other districts, but in mine it got harder to do my job and try to do my best for my customers."
bad,not interested in reviewing - nothing positive to say. Very unstable company to work for. They are writing their policies and procedures currently and management and staff just stays confused
bad,"training program leaves much to be desired, Rph's pick favorites, unequal responsibilities, unequal time at each station, you bascially teach yourself , modules leave much to be desired, if you start as a floater stay one"
bad,"this place really sucks. The management is the worst. Extremely strict, everything needs to be done by the book. no other way around it. SO much gossip."
bad,"District Manager strung me along for two years, while hiring outside the company for positions that I was well qualified.  The companies Logistical process is filled with errors."
bad,"The company has lots of interesting and hard working people, but management does not define clear direction nor allows you to empower its employees. Very reactive environment and very caustic to work in."
bad,"Bad enviorment, boring, Bad pay, long hrs, you work all holidays & weekends.Biggest plus was moving to the pharmacy but even that was hectic. Management frequently quit to."
bad,"greet customers, ring customers items, keep front end of store clean & stock. I learned how to work a cash register & time clock. My managers were very unprofessional & hard to work with. The hardest part of my job was being pregnant and standing on my feet for long periods at a time. the part I enjoyed most was coming into contact with different people"
bad,"Room for progression but sometimes was not fair "
bad,"Responsible for dispensing drugs to customer "
bad,"When I started at CVS, I felt as though my contributions made a difference to the success of the company and was compensated for it. Over time that corporate culture diminished and more work was demanded of me with less reward and recognition. Eventually, the company cut-back on resources but still demanded more work from the employees to the point of using lay-offs to reduce operating costs."
bad,"The training is just a million slides and still doesn't cover important things new employees should know. The pharmacy I worked in had horrible customer service skills, unfriendly to unfamiliar patients. Staff filled with drama. The manager was very unprofessional, talked about coworkers in group chats, looked up their facebooks to gossip about them at work and treated you differently if you didn't engage. Pharmacists get a listing of other technician jobs and other opportunities to move up but throws it away. Not at all diverse, at least not in the state of MN. Keep an eye out for advancements online to apply that way but overall avoid the company if you can."
bad,Managers and Upper Management used to care about their employees. Now it's all about numbers and goals. I've worked for them for 17 years and make less money than I did before!
bad,very uncertain scheduling terms.... recently bought out by CVS who has no history in the LTC pharmacy arena. there is a lot of turnover right now and cooperate versus operations confusion.
bad,"Working at my location is okay, however, I have had to fill in in other locations and it is understaffed and poorly managed.  Management doesn't seem to know what they are doing in the slightest, mostly upper management but a few local managers as well."
bad,"The job is not hard at all. Training is provided. Only thing that could use improvement would be the hours to be worked. Basically mandatory overtime on a daily basis when I was here. Which is bad if you have a family to take care of. Other than the hours, it was fairly decent."
bad,"Stores do not get enough CPHTs so there is a shortage of technicans. Customers are normally upset and short with pharmacy employees because they do not understand we can only have a set amount of people per pharmacist. Good job to be able to get your state and national license, though, because they will pay for both. Good starting milestone, but not a career."
bad,"Training was ridiculous, literally saw my trainer once for not even a minute in my 3 month training period. Store pharmacy was always so packed that they only ever used me at pick-up. There was always a constant long line but they never offered more hours or hired anymore techs. Got paid only $10.70/hr plus had to pay union dues."
bad,"The beginning stages of my employment with CVS specialty were very pleasant. However with the shift in management and chage of the direction of the phamacy, things have become very sressful"
bad,"I was responsible for counting medications for prescriptions, packaging, ringing up customer sales as well as inventory and customer calls regarding their medications."
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy tech for 4 years.  It was rewarding to be able to help customers with their pharmacy needs.  Pay was good at the time, during college.  Other than that, it was just a stepping stone job."
bad,"I was hired on as a packer.  I packed medications for mail delivery to  customers. The company would hold an occasional benefit for the employees if there were no errors in packing and drug dispensation. Being a facility where CVS ships medical supplies to customers, the facility sets high standards and you are punished accordingly if you fail to meet those standards. Since the medical supplies are crucial for the customers it is understandable that the warehouse has these standards, what is entirely unacceptable is the horrible pay rates and absolutely terrible benefits package offered by the company. You aren't being adequately compensated for what the company is asking you to do in the warehouse."
bad,"CVS Pharmacy technician is definitely not a job for the faint of heart. My store in particular had unorganized and passive management that led to a variety of problems in both the store and the pharmacy. These problems included scheduling issues, favoritism, and even discrepancies in pay. Overall, the CVS system is far inferior to other pharmacies of its rank. I would suggest Walgreen's or a private pharmacy if you are looking to become a technician."
bad,While working for this company the supervisor timed us constantly they gave us a 15 minute break for an 8 hour shift. We had to use this time to use the rest room or go outside to smoke. We had a half hour lunch and the supervisor timed us and if we happened to be 1 minute late our time sheet was docked. I have nothing good to say about this company.
bad,Manager did not know anything. Got sent home many times because we had disagreements on how the job should be done. Many people quit after working for him because he would not give enough hours for people to work and expected worked to be done. Did not know how to maje schedules so on busy times we had no employees on the floor.
bad,"The retail pharmacy environment is changing rapidly and has become a very stressful one as well.  Pay is decreasing along with"
bad,"The department, Care 1-on-1 is not organized. I had an experience with one of the supervisors. She said that I was not allowed to introduce services and a few hour later she apologized and said I was right. I have also received comments similar to this from other employees who worked in the same department. I enjoyed helping the customers and knowing I helped them maintain a great path to maintain their health with the services that they need."
bad,I worked with some great people and learn a lot about in this field. the work load was overwhelming especially when you had to stop what you are doing to start another compound that had to go out ASAP. Its okay to do may at the most 3 but 10-15 at a time and you still had other work to be done by a certain time. Also you had branch manager that didn't appreciate the employee's from the PIC to pharmacy technicians. There is no time for breaks or lunches. If you don't have a life this is the perfect place to work because you are going to work until everything is done so prepare to stay late. If you have a family and want to keep you family in tact then this is not the place to work.
bad,"Frustrated and Ill Management System, get impacted from offshore companies and have ruined the culture, work environment, no transparency in promotional criteria, no transparency in getting improvement, very ill managed, do not know how to manage tasks, teams, ill management systems overall."
bad,very dysfunctional management and poor communication skills from supervisors in pharmacy aspects. Overall pharmacy more concerned with meeting goals then actual compassion and patient care. All of wish I do not personally agree with so not the place where I would like to work or receive service.
bad,you are given the option to get certified as a pharmacy Tech which is good but the pay is not good they do not give decent raises and at one point it was only 2c
bad,"CVS pharmacy is a fortune top ten company, but has terrible management, horrible pay (way below the national average), and there is no sense of team."
bad,"My experience with this company started out with promises that were never fulfilled.  Very poor supervisor/team member communication, very critical supervisors that were not good at solving problems or people skills."
bad,"Coram is not a career just a job. They don't care about their employees well being, health or home life. They don't understand the importance of a happy healthy work environment. You are treated like a non existent robot rather than a person. They show favoritism and unfairness openly with out regard to the other hard working employees. They don't treat each employee fairly. It was a hostile environment. Very stressful place to work."
bad,"Company demanded to much out of employes managament doesnt know whats employes have to deal with on a daily basis, they want you to pull in way that they have time cut to every second, any second you waste your numbers would fall, employes need better represenation out of union reps and company need to listen to employes."
bad,Stressful when you have a store manager that does not do anything. I worked 45 HRS in two days because of inventory that should say iy all.
bad,Not a great experience. Was under a very biased manager who played favorites no matter what monthly reports said. No rewards for going above and beyond for patients multiple times except for a piece of paper with your name on it.  Don't expect to move up in this company or receive a raise.
bad,"The starting pay is decent, don't expect much for the raises though."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of being on the register and sales floor, attending to customer's needs. Providing excellent service and getting work done efficiently. Hardest part of working for the CVS I work for.. is not being appreciated for all the hard work I put in. I feel there is no team spirit and management tends to be careless towards employees. The most enjoyable part of my day at work is knowing I helped customers with a smile on my face."
bad,"Not bad company but not the best ,management isn't the best ,hardest part of the job is standing for 14 hours a day with no breaks allowed"
bad,"its okay workplace if you like ""cliques"" in business and decent part time job. And it is wonderful if you like to be bullied by a pharmacist."
bad,"It's a job.... Not a good company to have a career in. High expectations with no help to obtain those expectations.  Hours are constantly cut while the workload increases. Upper management does not care about their people only production. Employee turnover rate is high. Budget hours do not allow for extra help if an employee is ill.  Overtime is not aloud to cover other employees shifts. So if someone calls out either the manager or pharmacist and a tech will most likely have to work alone for 15 hours straight with no breaks. Most buildings are not well taken care of. Every CVS in my district has black mold coming out of the ceiling vents. Stress is normally very high amongst employees in this company therefore most stores harbor a hostile work environment.  Income is extremely low for the amount of work expected. Benefits are ok. Health insurance is average.  HSA account is about the best thing the company has going for it. They do give you around $1,200 a year if you put as little as $25 a week in the account. There is advancement in the company as long as you know someone at a higher level and are willing to make CVS your life."
bad,"Although CVS is a prominent company, it does not fully value its employees or compensate them for the work done or expected."
bad,"They're is no ""typical"" day as CVS IS Technician in the field, being called out is a 24/7 possibility which is not conducive to home and personal life. I have learned how to utilize the skills I came into the job with, I have independently had to study and investigate to resolve many issues on my own just to keep up. My co-workers are in the same situation, with the gross lack of communication and leadership it makes the job more difficult than it has to be. "
bad,"Overall CVS isn't some where to work at long term. I wouldn't make a career of retail pharmacy period. Being a pharmacy tech at Cvs was very stressful, our hours always varied, they cut our hours, and my new PIC (Pharmacists in Charge) decided to hire more people even though we barely had any hours to spare. There was plenty of unnecessary drama, I got to a point where i dreaded coming to work, i was miserable. One day I couldn't take it no longer and i quit. I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. Cvs wasn't all bad, I had some very lovable coworkers & customers but, overall it was quite an experience."
bad,The days are very high tempo and makes the day go by quickly.  The work is not hard but the atmosphere is soured by some of the employees and managers.
bad,Coram was a awesome place to work until the shift in management that changed the moral in the company completely. Would not go back with the same managers and structure in place. Very high turnover since the transition
bad,"I started working here as a pharmacy tech trainee and had a horrible experience with management. They lied to me before hiring that the schedule is flexible and set every month upon availability. As a student, this would work for me because I wanted to work around my class schedule. After 2 months, they started scheduling me whenever they wanted and I had to miss classes to be there. Although I did the best I could, I was always yelled at and given a load of work to do alone, low pay which never changed, and no respect. Stay away from this corporation. They treat you like machines and have no basic human dignity."
bad,I've worked in the pharmacy for 3 years now and the upper management doesn't really know how to handle a lot of situations. They expect a lot in return from the techs in unreasonable time. It's an okay part time job but I don't recommend anything full time. You have to be a real people person to work here and even then the customer's attitudes will break you.
bad,very little pay for such a work load. Always problems with management and your future in the company never looks bright.
bad,"I have worked there for a short period of time in the management team and I have never seen a company at its worse. They put managers or supervisors in those positions who they like not for what they know. That's why the company is running at its worse on a daily biases like bad planning ahead make you work alot of hours and weekends as well.They have let good employees go by them not making rate, they work 12hrs a day, it makes it hard for them to make rate. Employees get hurt because they over work them to the bone. If you're going to apply for the supervisor job here Think again, yeah the pay is great when you work 5 days a week 45hr but when they work you 7 days 12hr a week you look at your pay check and you're getting paid 8 dollars an hr and upper management gets the weekends off and the pressure is on the supervisors!!!! Every where I worked operation managers come in on weekends so show support for the employees and the company. The hardest part of this job is keeping people, they want you to engage with the associates but at the end the decisions they make, they turn them against you by the decisions they make in the final moment. Upper management needs to change in order for this place to work,Its not the company that's bad it's the management that makes this place look bad. In the past three months supervisors have resigned from this place and people quit on a daily basis.My co-workers, well most of them are promoted with in, that's why they're afraid to speak up because they know if they do they'll get terminated.If you don't want or have a life and want to be treated"
bad,"This company is by far the worst company to work for. They don't care about their employees at all. There is absolutely no room for growth and the pay doesn't amount to you standing on your feet for 8 hours a day and all the other duties you have to do not to mention staying over some days. CVS is underpaying their employees. I asked my former pharmacist manager could I transfer to a store in my hometown because I drive back and forth for an hour round trip, and he specifically said ""No"". I even went to higher management and they did absolutely nothing about it. This is a job for college students not someone who are trying to  get somewhere in life. The only good experience I had with this company were my fellow Co workers. They were a great team. I will definitely miss them but not the company, manager, or the pay!"
bad,Upper Management lost the customer service edge company is doing a lot of things to get them away from customer service they don't care about employees or customers.
bad,They were understaffed the entire time I worked there. I was forced to do over time and they did not seem to care so much about how hard the team was working to get the job done understaffed. Technicians showed lack of respect for the Pharmacist (really bothered me) management was not open to caring for many of the work related issues. My confidentially got broken twice while being apart of this company and the management did not seem to have a concern about either matters being so open. Employees seemed mentally and physically tired of the environment.
bad,"I worked here for 5 years and was so disrespected, under paid and most definetly over worked.  All this company cares about is numbers not their employees or customers."
bad,"The managers are great the job itself, not so great. I'm not to big into retail. Simply was just a job to make money during school."
bad,"The best part about my job was working with the customers.  I loved helping them.  My coworkers were at times negative, but usually wonderful to work with.  Unfortunately, my supervisor was not professional at all. She had no leadership skills and often yelled at individual people.  She had many complaints, but no action was ever taken.  I ultimately left the company because of her behavior."
bad,"management was never there for you when a problem needed attention lack of communication,would never answer the on call phone when i rang"
bad,I enjoy the people that I work with but the pay is terrible. it is not somewhere that I would recommend for people to work. it is not somewhere most would find a good salary.
bad,"Unless you are able to function with the speed, accuracy, commitment, lifespan, strength, and emotional coldness of a robot, you're better off finding a job elsewhere. CVS demands far more than what they compensate you for, and enough is never enough. "
bad,I learned a great many things about the world of long term care.  I worked in every area of the pharmacy and its processes.  I would always make myself available to all areas of the business to gain as much information as possible.  I would volunteer on a daily basis to help where the greatest need was. There was always a large turnover of employees due to lack of communication and training.  I enjoyed being cross trained and having the ability to help where ever I was needed.  I enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with different areas of the pharmacy and getting to know the bigger picture.
bad,"The immediate management was lazy and rude. The one I worked in was a union and because I was new, I was the employee working all weekends and holidays. It was an easy job and didn't require much effort but there was no room for advancement due to long standing employees. Upper management did not seem qualified to run the establishment and let his supervisors walk all over him. Overall the culture of the store is laziness with no idea of actual work."
bad,I started off loving my job here because I loved working in this field but it became very inconsistent and excessive working hours.
bad,"They cut hours monthly, want you to do more and more with less and less. They tell you if you cannot get it done then we can find someone that can."
bad,Hours and staff were low. The customers were mean but always have the nice ones. Schedule was not good. Pay was horrible.
bad,"I have learned many different name of prescriptions, what prior authorization means, what different type insurance companies are out there and why a prescription would get rejected for a patient."
bad,"The lead pharmacist was terrible and blamed me for mistake because I was new. to prove my innocent's, I have to start putting my initials on everything I do. I was so happy to leave this low paying job that required so much for us to do."
bad,"A job is a job no matter where you go, but what you do with it is up to you. Problem is without any room for advancement is a bit of a damper. Wanting to learn more and experience more is the challenge for you, and will benefit the company you work for."
bad,"So I left 2 jobs to work here. A lot of my opinions is self responsibility and the what is being said and shown to me by the company,nothing is one sided."
bad,Work hard for very low pay. They cdon't care about anything but money. no compassion for others. Management terrible.The best part of the job is the clients.
bad,Absent Senior Management and no clear directions given.  Co workers were supportive.  More work given but not compensation and no tools to use to reference the correct procedure.
bad,"CVS as a company may be a good place to work, but there is not a very good work life balance at this Distribution center. They are still in the startup mode and have a very high turn over rate for new hires. It may take years for stability to be achieved at this location and they will go through numerous managers and supervisors to get there due to the extreme amount of hours they work and the lack of commitment to a decent work life balance."
bad,"Worked the .com pharmacy. Great group of people until you get to upper management. I was middle management. "
bad,Really need to be aware of store management and implement better training programs for new employees
bad,"Customer service, customer counseling of OTC products & area in store where they are, counting medications, verifying pharmacy stock."
bad,looking for another career opportunity looking to further my career
bad,The work that is involved is not worth what they pay you. Management makes inappropriate comments in front of other employees/ customers. Front end is horrible but the pharmacy is very helpful.
bad,"L'Environnement est très désagreable , travail dans un entrepot plutot sombre remplis de poussiéres sans aucune ventilation ni aucun chauffage de plus il n'y a aucune securité et materiel adéquat."
bad,At CVS it is important to know how to move fast and learn fast. There is no room for error or to redo anything. 8 hours on your feet with no breaks makes a person appreciate the small things in life
bad,Very repetitive tasks. Little advancement opportunity. Uptight Management. Unrealistic expectations. Nosy coworkers.
bad,"Employees are expected to work 10-11 hour days on a regular basis, not just during deadline periods. The tax function is the most micro-managed I've experienced in 30 years, up to and including the VP of tax. There is no work/life balance."
bad,"Worked as an acute dialysis technician for a nursing home, caring for the nursing home patients in need of this service.  I was stationed by the nursing station and called for assistance as needed with the care of my patients.  I filtered their blood via dialysis machine 3x a week, and made sure that they were not in any immediate danger due to me working with minimal assistance from the nurse.  The best part of my job was working alone and learning how to depend on my own judgment when it came to patient care.  The worst part of my job was getting assistance from management concerning other issues.  They were practically nonexistent and inaccessible all of the time, for they were stationed in another city in IL.  The dialysis division shut down, forcing me to look for work elsewhere at that time."
bad,The office I worked in had terrible management in my department.  Supervisor often used profanity toward employees.  Unrealistic goals.
bad,"Mandatory overtime, usually with less than 24 hour notice. Badly managed standards that are not clearly defined. Many daily meetings focus on how terrible ""we"" (your group) are doing and threatening mandatory overtime hours on your weekends. During some meetings broad statements of how some of us lack common sense or other non-specific statements about the stupidity of ""some"" employees. I like being able to help patients with orders, however at times you feel soulless. There is no accountability to quality service standards, and  all management pushes for is numbers, not patient satisfaction."
bad,I learned the process of medicare part D pharmacy insurance. It a very time consuming process and knowledge about the job
bad,Every day was different you never knew when you were getting off of work depending on the work load. Management was awful never dealt with problems. My co-workers were great and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make plans because you never know when you are getting off of  work
bad,Good way to get sick. Management trys to mess with you. Working in the isles you smell the rodent feicies.
bad,"We have a double drive-thru window within our pharmacy, which with the low staffing, we have to work VERY hard and be extremely good at multi-tasking.  Dealing with the customers trying to pick up their meds can be very challenging, and difficult due to things that our out of our control, but we have to handle it with compassion."
bad,"You really don't--enough said"
bad,"Omnicare is not a good company, at least not the department I work in."
bad,"interact with customers, fill prescription orders, The job itself was something that I really enjoyed"
bad,"Never work for a company that beats around the bush in giving you a higher position/raise, or for a company that makes up stories to get you fired. It happened to me, don't let it happen you."
bad,I enjoyed working with this company when I first started 15 years ago.  The last 5 years have brought in the most ignorant and unprofessional management that I have seen.  Watch your back is all I can say
bad,"Typical day at work would be doing whatever you are told to be by shouting management.  We were treated like robots to type faster faster faster! Either sat in front of a computer and entered new rx's all day or refills all day or answered incoming calls all day or did outgoing calls all day.  Sometimes we were forced to do many of those at once and still forced to type faster faster faster WITHOUT ANY ERRORS!....impossible? YES!"
bad,"I, today *(8/29/13), saw this advertisement for my job, which apparently was posted on 8/13. I was terminated on 8/14, before my probationary period had expired. "
bad,Overall it was an opportunity for me to learn to work with the public  while acquiring & using my customer service skills.
bad,"i loved my co workers to death, and i was usually stationed at the production station so my day consisted of answering phone calls and filling prescriptions the hardest part of my job was being understaffed and having a management problem"
bad,"poor management, messed with scheduling a lot, coworkers not very customer oriented.... however, I loved helping the customers. never received a portion of my paychecks and never got my raise"
bad,"managment is not fair and they do not work with you if you have a family emergency or want to go to school. you can go from 40 hours to 5 just because you want to go to school.i watched and learned what not to do as a manager, because i would like to be a great manager one day.my co-workers are the best people to work with. we are all there for eachother, we are like a family.the hardest part working there was dealing with the managers and how they never stand up for their employees when it comes to customers or other management or employees."
bad,"It's good for a part time gig, but for an actual career, they're terrible."
bad,The highlight to working at Coram was working with the nursing staff. They are all compassionate caring individuals that work hard every day to make sure the patients receive wonderful care.
bad,Long hours and no communication within management that trickles down effectively to employees.
bad,"managers, dont know anything about ANYTHING (vacation time, sick days , personal days, or the way the photo kiosk works!!) its like every man for him self. then they get mad because the front store has low scores. UNDERSTAFFED!!!!!! youll be lucky to have 2 days off in a row (thats if you ignore their calls). the store i worked at the main store manager wouldnt keep his employees in the loop, he would only come to do payroll and write people up. like its his store he should be here to help out to. i started as a cashier and then got promoted to supervisor. sounds good right? nope i only got a .30 cent raise from being a CASHIER! i was there for a year 6months as a cashier and 6 months as a supervisor . towards the end of my year i was TRYING to get demoted because management is a JOKE at cvs, Too many problems for not enough pay."
bad,"Highly over worked for the amount of compensation. A ton of micro management and way too many ""chiefs and not enough indians"" Very little room for advancement. If you dont kiss butt then you dont advance. Supervisors play favorites and if youre not a favortie then youre a black sheep"
bad,"After being employed with this company a while, You prepare for work before you leave your home. You must get your mindset and prepare for battle with not only the callers but your employer as well. You work short staffed and with improperly trained or untrained staff. Management no longer cares about the employes. If you have any problems or identify a potential problem they will only be nice and provide canned responses. No genuine sympathy or concern."
bad,"Advancement & pay were based on ""who you know"" not skills or capabilities. Management would lie to your face, and ask you to lie to customers. They did not encourage continuing education or reward for it."
bad,"Long hours, short breaks, no benefits and the management is not understanding of the employees needs"
bad,Every employee was responsible for putting away the truck. Also each employee is responsible for helping maintain the look and cleanliness of the store.
bad,worked here for four years and did not realize till I left how much stress was actually from my job.. Worked most days 12 to 14 hours a day one day 20 hours . Seasoned managers worked just as hard as I did and were equally stressed. Quality of life is nonexistant. The co workers were great! T
bad,"Tend to focus more on meeting far-fetched quotas, which are not reachable with the lack of employees staffed. Focus should be more on providing quality patient care and delivering medications in a timely manner."
bad,There is no real room for growth or advancement within this company. The hours dont balance well for people who have a life outside of work.
bad,"short breaks , no good pay or hours, mean staff, no benefits shall i go on? customers dont understand just how hard it is working back there and give you a HARD time"
bad,poor management policy voilations good employees to work with low moral hours of work were good I did data entry work shipping receiving inventory etc...
bad,I worked there for 2 1/2 years and what i can say is that is was very crazy for a typical day there which over time it grows on you so i knew what to expect but learning that draining myself of every little oz of energy for the place for so lil money and respect from the company they dont know what is said on how they treat thier employess thats why so many leave. Of course the enjoyable part was the fast pace which made time to go home quicker. i hope down the road they will notice and change the way they do things.
bad,had flexibility to work with cross functional teams.
bad,Before Omnicare took over I honestly loved my job and the co-workers were the best. Then things changed people left due to the buy-out and everything started to go downward. I had to start driving about 50 miles daily one way and this was not told to me when I agreed to stay on with new pharmacy. I did this for about 1 year and when we re-located back to our original pharmacy my job was eliminated. The hardest part of this job was when we had to answer phones and try and do data entry we had goals we had to meet daily. Which started to be had to obtain due to answering calls. Management was poor they just wanted the work done not caring who did it.
bad,"The company as a whole is not bad and there are a lot good people working for the company. The company does not place an emphasis on the associates. There are executives making millions in bonus money, yet they took away the little Christmas bonus that the hourly associates use to receive"
bad,out with the old in with the new--no policy handbook therfore they mak up rules as they go along
bad,Not a good place if you want to advance in your pharmacy tech career. political politics is a big role if you want to advance. Very disorganized in a sense of moving up in the company.
bad,"Cashier's aren't paid enough. They are always cutting hrs. I was a shift supervisor and I was not properly trained, store manager acted like he couldn't be bothered most of the time. Pay should have been more and you wouldn't work a full 40 in a week."
bad,The stress level is high. Staff work too hard for the pay. Staff work hours without break and unpaid hours. Staff are really wonderful people and deserve much better.
bad,Picking and packing and pulling orders.loading and unloading trucks picking orders for customers and nurseing home wearhouse numbers ALLDAY seven days a week
bad,"CVS does not hire enough people to cover the pharmacy, so you have employees that are extremely stressed in trying to get the job done.  They also do not support any feedback on how to improve this situation."
bad,"Constantly making promises that weren't kept. Promised a raise, then was not given one after a year of exceptional work. Not impressed with how management explained why either. Gave excuse that due to full time hours given, raise was low. However I was hired to be full time"
bad,"One of the most grueling places to work.  If you are single, do not have kinds, or any other responsibilities, this is a great place.  If you are willing to put 12+ hours you will advance quickly.  However, do not expect to get a pat on the back or a thank you.  They will pay you well and this is about it."
bad,"It's a joke, corporate is also lame they want workers to comply to rules that they wont even adhere to. Sometimes marketing is a joke, the only good I see they have done so far is replace the old self checkout machines."
bad,"CVS wasn't a great workplace an is no different than a lot of other retail corporations. They say one thing and totally do the opposite in a horrible way. The training is terrible and inefficient, per each location. The pay is usually minimum wage per state, and not a lot of raises. There isn't a lot of support from your management team for the floor, but this depends on the location too. The turnover is outrageous and so is the lost prevention. There are opportunities for mobility but this also depends on if you are like by the management in the store."
bad,"For the amount of work needed by corporate, the compensation is less than exceptional... many people in the company will agree that it is grunt work for a slave wage... no matter what position you are in, in the store..."
bad,I don’t Recommend people to work for Cvs because they don’t care about doing employees nor their customers right.  It’s all about a dollar. It is sad how the company has went down the past year
bad,"I worked at CVS for over 3 years. I really did enjoy the excellent coworkers I had the pleasure of working with on a daily basis as well as most of my customers and patients. However, there is a huge disconnect with upper management when it comes to treatment of employees as well as treatment of patients."
bad,"before CVS acquired Omnicare, we were proud to work there. we felt valued and the company always showed us employees they appreciated us. Moral was good and we felt we all shared the same purpose: to get patients there meds. the real big problem with omnicare was more of a technoligical one as we ran day to day operations on a very very old system. CVS came in and forced their retail  business  model  on  us and we have been suffering  ever  since"
bad,"A typical day at work was non stop calls with EXTREMELY structured breaks and 30 min lunches.   Corporate slavery very unprofessional behavior of most of the employees.  "
bad,When I first started work for the company 4 1/2 years ago I liked my job but now its all about pushing the workers to do the jobs of 10 people while making them as much money as possible. They don't care about the employees especially when they are struggling with trying to find help. We need people to run the store and without that they can't make their money but they don't give a cr*p. They just push more work on us and except us to do everything right then and there while staying late because we can't do the work during the time that we are there. Especially when their stuff keeps braking like the registers or the system crashing. How are we suppose to assist customers when we don't have a working register.
bad,"I love my job at CVS in general, however management is not good and I am not getting the hours I was promised. "
bad,"They only care about themselves and seem to care less about the conditions for their employees. I would not recommend working for this company. Not many benefits, if any at all. Very rude customers make the day very unpleasant. This store needs much better management. Conditions in the store are not very pleasant and turnover are common because employees are not very happy."
bad,"While I was there, management was a revolving door.  I had 11 different pharmacist supervisors in a year and a half.  The job is extremely high stress and fast paced.  It was common to be 4 to 6 hours behind in filling scripts, due to being short staffed.  When we would bring in the needed help, the work area was too cramped and we'd mainly get in each other's way.  The employees didn't get along either, with some blatantly trying to sabotage other workers.  Management would help individuals that fell behind but ignored the behavior of the bad apples."
bad,I rather say nothing at all than to say anything bad and now that should let you know how I feel about this company. I worked there for 10 years. Maybe the job just burnt me out!
bad,"I was fired because they did not feel as though I was good enough. However, I beg to differ. I was not trained as well. I felt more threatened by the two main managers, the store manager and store assistant manager. I didn't feel welcomed. I felt like I was more of a burden than actually providing any good use. I know I could've been a better employee, but they certainly were not supportive"
bad,it was very face paced work and everyone was everywhere or standing around like they didn't know what to do. they were rude and inefficient. their classes/training to being pharmacy was outstanding.
bad,"I love working as a pharmacy technician. CVS Ephrata had terrible management and was terribly understaffed. CVS as a whole is a great company to work for. Ephrata, however, was awful."
bad,"Overworking staff and cutting hours is the culture. Many work off clock to catch up. Employees leaving every week. Mgmt does not listen to employees just appears concerned  about their own jobs and “good numbers”. Customer service is not a priority for mgmt. employees try their best but constantly pushed for more. “Ethics Line” is a sham! If you have a concern with a manager, they take your info and route call to manager  so concerns hit a wall"
bad,"When I was hired, the man I interviewed with was the store manager. He was down to earth, easy to talk to and open. After being hired on I was still excited. after working there a couple of months I was still eager to prove myself. They were a bit unorganized. A lot of people there weren't willing to help you learn more. They acted like if they taught you anything their job wasn't secure anymore. It was all for one and one for drama. I hated the environment after the original store manager left so I left to find something better and more comfortable to work."
bad,"Management is bad, working the overnight shift is hard if only one"
bad,My experience at CVS was less than pleasant. My managers were forgetful and showed little interest in the employees and more on the store ranking. Hours were unpredictable per week for part time employees and weren't posted until 1-3 days before the new work week but they were flexible with my school schedule.
bad,"This location turned out to be the worst place I ever worked. Under two prior managers the store was ran smoothly and I was on a path to become the next store manager yet after they left and the District manager left/quit There was a huge difference. The store was given to a mgr who didn't want to be there and was afraid of people. The supporting leaders cared less than he did and came and went as they pleased while on the clock. leaders cursed at customers and physically fought people they ""thought"" were stealing. knocking over elderly people in the process. All of the things I was trained on such"
bad,This is one of the worst companies to work for. They treat their employees like they are trash and some of the management are racist. literally say racist remarks to your face and behind your back.
bad,"Upper management came from pharmacy backgrounds and had no front store retail experience.  Only knew the business ""on paper"" and had no concept of how things were in reality on a daily basis."
bad,"Working for the company was a total night mare,"
bad,"As a long time employee, I have seen first hand the mistreatment of many fellow employees, myself included. Always shorthanded and forced to worked ""off the clock"" just to keep the pharmacy a float."
bad,Not much to do in the office because of low clientele  and the company doesn’t know what they’re doing in the optical department. Unorganized management and threatened losing job almost every month.
bad,"Turnover is incredible for managers and front line staff. The work culture is very unstable. They are now hiring anyone they can find and new employees are not trained well enough to handle demands of upper management, leaving managers to do a lot of the heavy work. Systems and policies are not employee friendly and favoritism runs rampant."
bad,"Company has on going changes that affects the employees (money, benefits, etc ).  Its nice when you have a strong team at work, it makes working smarter & not harder."
bad,"Cvs is weeding out the people who care about the patients. The only people that can actually work there and leave the pharmacy without feeling immense guilt for not taking care of patients the way they should be taken care of are the people who don’t have heart or compassion, and they are perfect for the job."
bad,"Warning!! Do not work here! This company is a complete joke. It seemed all great and like it would be a piece of cake after the interview. Yes every job has it’s stressful moments, but the way employees are treated is uncalled for. To begin with when first hired, my first day was a nightmare, they don’t train you how to do anything and you will stand there clueless asking questions other associates don’t even know answers to. Every time you come in it is dreadful the managers all hate their jobs. You will only be working with yourself and one manager if you need help and call for the manager for the numbers, for approval or if you have a question they get a attitude about it, they will complain to customers about employees also.  Not only have I heard one talking just about me but multiple other employees. Disgusting and unprofessional. There’s no ac. So it gets hot.  Manager tells you do something and you do it exactly how you were “taught” and you get in trouble because it’s wrong and when asking the correct way and admitting that’s how I was trained apologized and asking for help and how to actually do something. Didn’t get a real answer just a rude response that I should know by now. The store is a mess they hire on so many people that when they promise hours you will never receive them. No matter what you do here your wrong. They will talk down to you and to others about you. You won’t get the hours promised. They will promise this that and the other to get you to say yes to the job don’t fall for it. It’s all a lie. They don’t care about their employees. The attitude of"
bad,"CVS was an okay place to work. There are many staff changes constantly that make it more than a little stressful. Policies can be hard to follow when not everyone will adhere to them. Customers know what to say and who to mention to get around you very easily. Overall, it's just a job. Not really room to grow or learn."
bad,This was a great company to work for until they started having managerial changes and forcing people out. The managers and assistants were not promoted from within and the ones they brought over with them were not adaptable to our situation and what we had going on.
bad,"I came in as a Contractor; 90% of Contractors are looked at as disposable workers."
bad,"Severely understaffed, ridiculous expectations, harassing outbound sales calls required (minimum of  3 per customer per week), terrible management.  Positive is competitive pay in union stores and good health insurance."
bad,"This company does not care about it employees, and will unlawfully fire you at anytime they see fit. They pay more then minimum wage, so you think it is great pay but then give you a ton of work and expect it all done at once. They are also currently in the process of replacing there employees with robotic self checkout machines. CVS as a whole company does not care about anyone or anything besides the money in their greedy corporate pockets. This is not a company i would ever go back and work for. The job may be tolerable, but the corporate aspect is not something you should want to work for."
bad,I will not comment on this company. I can not judge this company as a whole but parts or districts are broken and employees are suffering. I have nothing more to say on this matter.
bad,Too much work in a very stressful environment. The company continually cuts ttech and RPH hours but Run away. PCAs with less education and no licensing make more $$$
bad,There is no advancement as a Pharmacy Technician and no room for growth. The management level needs improvement. There are no leadership roles in any CVS.
bad,The company has gone down hill quickly with deep cuts to store’s operational payroll. Managers are stressed until they leave. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Employees talk behind their backs."
bad,"I’ve been with CVS Retail for years now, and absolutely feel stuck. The highest they promote within to was Shift Supervisors, but now Operation Managers which is literally just Shift Supervisors the manage sticks more of their tasks on. They promise possible promotion to good employees into higher management, but just outsource instead. You probably have to quit and reapply to even get a store manager in training position. But even then, it’s not worth it. They especially overwork the new managers and purposefully put them in challenging stores without them even being fully prepared. So! If you want a job, this is definitely a check, and you basically need to blantly steal to get fired... but dont do it unless it’s just a stepping stone. It’s a deadend place to be."
bad,"Bottom line: this company does not care about their workers. Sometimes (many times) you will get off at Midnight then have to go right back in at 7am. The store Manager assured me of a raise and promotion that never came. I was a supervisor who was making less money and scheduled for less hours than a cashier; rarely did I get close to full-time which was another lie from the manager who said I would be switched to full time."
bad,I was hired on the spot. With tons of promises of getting me to my end goal. That lasted a week. My store manager wasnt very motivated and the rest of the team/managers were disgruntled. I came in with energy and excitement but it wasn't having any impact. I think the company puts too much pressure on the little man (store employees) to do so much while they continue to gut hours. As managers we were expected to run 2 to 3 registers at a time during busy times. Plus answer all calls. It got to be too much and when we would voice our concerns with the DM. We are told that's just the way it is..
bad,"No work life balance and unclear and indecisive upper management, No payroll to achieve unrealistic goals, standards, and budgets. Unsafe working conditions because in most stores employees are forced to work alone for most if not all of their shift."
bad,"There is quite a lot that I wish to convey through this, but I am just simply going to stress that CVS is not somewhere that I would recommend working. The benefits offered are awful and, depending upon the location, hours given to employees are a real problem. If you are lucky you will receive just a smidgen under what is considered full time. The higher ups make it very obvious that they have no intention of letting many employees move up to full-time status. "
bad,"The managing staff that is not in the building think 1 person can do the work of 4 without overtime. In the 3 years I have worked there we have lost 6 positions and they will not let us hire more. As a result, we are losing customers and the higher-ups cannot figure out how when we have lost 6 positions we can't keep up with the work."
bad,"CVS does not take care of its employees. I loved my co-workers, but the company continuously showed its apathy to employees and changed policy regularly to display their lack of trust."
bad,"Work in call center doing out going calls. Hired for one job and it has change at least three times since. Have had four different managers and restructured twice. This has all occurred within a year! No consistency and poor planning. To make it more painful, the pay and benefits are minimal!"
bad,Toxic environment to work.Management doesn’t care and do not respect people of color. I wouldn’t wish this on my enemy and stay healthy you do not want any of these home infusion places to have to take care of you or anyone in your family.
bad,And micromanage on everything you do.. they make you responsible for things out of your control. The pay is awful and your hours can go from 40 to 24 for fulltime. Not consistent.
bad,"Bad corporate management; pay is too low for independent sustainability; high turnover; good place to work if you are not some breadwinner and/or need below national poverty level pay to sustain your lifestyle; good stepping stone to learn retail pharmacy basics; some locations, very few, are okay but most are horrible with overworked staff and understaffed pharmacies."
bad,"overworked and under appreciated, 45 work weeks turn into 70 hour marathons, never enough help in the districts to get the work done on the timelines demanded by the DL's"
bad,"CVS recently bought Aetna.  All employees are forced to use CVS pharmacies if they want their meds covered under Aetna insurance; which means your colleagues know whatever medicine you take. Not sure how that doesn't violate HIPAA law, but they get away with it.  CVS has already begun to monopolize the industry which means eventually we won't be able to do anything when they raise prices and lower quality of service / customer care.  To job seekers:  Do yourself a favor and heed all the warnings from those that have worked here- Find work elsewhere!  To customers:  Try to be nice to store staff, especially pharmacy department because they are way overworked and underappreciated. It's corporate that forces the pharmacy staff to carry the cheapest possible generics.  It's corporate guidelines that make the pharmacists fight doctors so that they prescribe similar, less effective medicines in the same class, in order to cut their costs (not yours).  Remember, if you have Aetna, CVS is now your insurance company too).  Last - check your prescriptions because they're often short.  Please report CVS to the BBB if you feel they have done anything unethical."
bad,"Every day is like walking into a losing battle. It's a skeleton crew day-in, day-out due to higher-ups not allowing enough hours to function properly. Many of our techs are extremely proficient and fast, but filling 5500+ scripts weekly is a giant beast with our crummy available tech hours."
bad,"Through out the years of working in various locations with this employer, I experienced absolutely no job work/ life balance due to long hours and limited help."
bad,"Poor management all around, lack of budget and managerial responsibility- constant finger pointing somewhere else, no accountability. Boring office environment, no leadership. No growth, no collaboration."
bad,"Rude customers and don't get paid enough for basically doing the work of a manager. They don't hire maintenance to clean a bathroom that looks as, if not more, unsanitary as a gas station bathroom."
bad,It started out as a good place to work. Near the end of training there was an unrealistic expectation in regards to workload. As a new employee I was expected to complete 18+ cases in a day when other coworkers were completing around 15.
bad,"on a typical day you will deal with rude and nice customers, you will deal with staff that wants to do things there way verses the companies way. you will battle with unruly providers on the phone that don't want you to approve something for a customer. with this job you must have tuff skin and be a peoples person. you must have a love for helping people, because if you don't, this job will chew you up and spit you out! This job will teach you patients and understanding for others"
bad,"Poor conditions, little respect for employees, lack of communication. Limited hours of work. No respect for individual lives. Only think of themselves."
bad,The environment can be hostile at CVS. There is a lack of a unified culture as your experience will vary greatly depending on which store you are working in. Management is in need of better training before being thrown in a store. The training provided is not consistent and again varies based on the store you are working in.
bad,Watch your back.. and trust NO ONE.  Everyone is out for themselves.  You can not count on anyone’s word and no one tells the truth. It it horrible!  I have never felt more betrayed in all my life. The gossiping and talking behind people’s back. It was like being back in high school. Amazing to me to how these people call themselves grownup!
bad,"I worked here briefly. I ran into issues immediately on my first day hired. I warned them BEFORE I even got hired that I had a medical appointment that day. I was told ‘Oh, it’s ok we’ll let them know you’ve had this set before hand and you’ll have to leave early for the appointment’. Before I started the job I even sent a reminder email as it was essential I go. Of course my first day of work I was told the have no record of me ever saying I had the appointment (never mind my emails and the fact it is on my application as well) and that I was not allowed to go period. So I went 8 weeks without any medication to complete my training. My entire time working here was pretty similar to this situation, which is unfortunate as the job is insanely easy. Very simply put, this a job that does not care about its employees."
bad,I didn't work at CVS but Apria/Coram.  The Indianapolis area is no totally different and I am not familar with the new version..........................
bad,"Working hard, long days for a store that not only did not keep work professional, but was constantly at odds with each other. My promotion from clerk to supervisor was swift, however, most of the other team members felt threatened by my work ethics. The Assistant Manager heard our Regional Manager mention of promoting me again and began to harass me into quiting my job."
bad,The department cared more about the numbers instead of the employees. It didn't matter how hard people worked if they didn't meet the numbers they were fired.
bad,"Two very poor managers, unfortunately they control over have of the pharmacy. Not easy to work for people that do not lead by example. Pharmacy is severly short staffed and you are expected to stay late and help out other departments, even if your department is behind. All the employees are realizing that Omnicare is not willing to pay for them, they pay you poorly and expect you to go above and beyond for nothing. They are losing facilities left and right because of the lack of leadership, desperate for someone to make a stand and get new management. GM is great, some of the people are amazing. A few pharmacists are incompetent though and refuse to do certain duties they are obligated to do to be a pharmacist at the pharmacy."
bad,you just have to work here to know the process. too many much responsibility for so little workers. the company needs to hire more employee to get the job done. i have said it all just work here to find out. management needs more training in order to have a good work place to work. hardest part of job is when your all alone to fill all prescriptions. i learned to work really hard to get burn out. to help the community just work hard.
bad,"Hours are budgeted horrendously. Never enough help, regardless of increasing work load. The required training is inadequate. You are given a severely basic 'class', and expected to function at full capacity in an hectic and confusing system that changes frequently. Higher-ups have absolutely no clue as to how their employees are doing, nor do they seem to care.  Overall, a terrible place to work. Too much stress, not enough team work, and no one listens to the ones who have to implement the jobs."
bad,"CVS is a place that only cares about the bottom line as with most if not all companies that deal with pharmaceuticals now. Everything is based around certain metrics and though they have their catchy ""We Care"" slogans it is only in reference to the financial benefits their customers provide them. Definitely not applicable to their employees. In pursuit of that end, for lack of a better term you are slaved to their every beck and call with little to no support from your corporate higher ups as overall their only interest is metrics. There is very high turn over company wide because of all the work the company asks of its employees with compensation that is no where comparable to the duties asked. In regards to the pharmacy, the techs have to be certified but are paid similar to what you would find in a job without the state/national certification requirements. Pharmacists are compensated well but definitely are worked for every dollar they earn. Many are forced to work LONG inhumane hours without opportunity for break. If you're planning on working for CVS try to be out within 6 months to a year if a front store employee or pharmacy tech, and 5 years if a pharmacist. There are comparable jobs you can do with better or similar compensation without the level of stress, CVS places on its employees company-wide."
bad,Call center very routine. Must be comfortable making 100 + calls per day and being monitored. Yearly testing for HIPPA and FDCPA.  Must be able to follow strict rules when speaking with customers. Script like environment. Strict attendance policy
bad,Liked working there a lot of nice people. Worked as a team to get the job done. Supervisor was nice and helpful. learned a lot about Medicare and Medicaid.
bad,"I ""moved up"" within the company twice. I ended up in the dept that I thought I would spend the most time in because I enjoyed it. little did I know it would be the dept to take me down. my immediate manager was great. but her sr manager was AWFUL! I was written up 4 times in a matter of 2-3 months when their new sr manager came on. Written up over the most minut things. things my immediate manager said she didn't agree with but her hands were tied and they didn't listen to her. In the end I was fired after almost 6 years with this company. "
bad,"managment was poorly ran. I was moved over 100 miles from home for work, i was never home when needed, worked late, and never got days off when requested"
bad,This place some times get very busy because business does not understand IT at all. I learned project management here. Management does not care about employees. Workplace culture is no work like balance.
bad,Management is all I can say. I loved this job as in title and duty but management is why I left.pay is not equal to job duties. There are many job functions.
bad,"management had favorites and skipped others for promotions for their favorite, very unorganized, and slightly unprofessional, never got the schedule in enough time."
bad,"I've been working at CVS for a year and six months, and through my time being employed as a pharmacy technician at CVS pharmacy I felt as though I was not valued as an employee. I tried to put my best foot forward especially when it came to dealing with certain issues that came about with management but it was made apparent to me  that my feelings did not matter in the ordeal. I've have the opportunity to work with some really awesome people at CVS but it still does not take away from the fact that the company needs to reevaluate and hire leaders who want to build a strong team and acknowledge everyone's strong point and build on their weak points."
bad,"This is an o.k. job. It is what you would expect from a retail store. The best part of the job was the people I worked with. My ratings would be completely different if they did not have a revolving door of managers and they paid a decent salary. I was getting paid minimum wage, then I got a raise, I had a raise for a month then minimum wage went up and I was once again being paid minimum wage like everyone else."
bad,CVS will run you into the ground. You will not have a home life. They cram mandatory OT down your throat. Management is beyond sloppy. Horrible Atmosphere. They will give you holidays off but you will make those hours up plus more extra hours with mandatory OT.
bad,"The information technology team at Caremark is very good. However, management is so poor that employee turn over never stops. Employess are under appreciated and used to produce for management."
bad,Very poorly organized needs work with computer systems.  Training could be longer and more extensive. Management could give more time to be implemented to the system
bad,"stressful every day, poor management, technicians don't get the pay they deserve when they do more work than pharmacists. company favors quantity over quality which is potentially life-threatening for patients, I could go on for hours.."
bad,"Worked very hard and sacrificed so much of my life and my family to earn insurance eligibility, which never happened. I quit my Masters Program and worked more and more with no pay-off in the end. I was lied to on a recorded line by HR regarding eligibility for benefits and it didn't matter to them. I took leave and had a mental breakdown. This company almost broke me. They did not, I am now a nurse practitioner moving on to bigger and better."
bad,CVS experiences vary from store to store.  But in most stores we techs are overworked and underpaid.  Working conditions are fairly miserable.  The front store employees seem to have better work load.  The pay and benefits are on the high end of average for pharmacist and managers but low for me and other techs unless you've been there for over 10 years.  I quit to go back to the Waffle House.
bad,"I’ve been with CVS for 19 years, and the last 6 months have felt like my job is on the line.  I always had good reviews until working with this pharmacy manager, and he has also run off 3 technicians and helped run off 4 front store employees, but apparently upper management is wearing blinders."
bad,"employees hate working there. management doesn't have any consideration for employees lives, just that they meet their own goals. goals are lofty and cut throat. management is very poor. i couldnt wait to leave that company."
bad,"This job was really stressful, and unattainable goals are constantly pushed on us. CVS expects A LOT of its employees, but does not compensate fairly. It's picking and choosing between gas to get to work and food to eat or paying the bills: can't do both. Always short-staffed. Hours are all over the place. 12 hours one week, 34 the next. You're going to work holidays, and weekends. Customers are impossible!!!!! This job made me hate people, and I hate that. I decided the pay wasn't worth the stress and anxiety this job gives me. I gave my 2 week notice, but with how customers are, I'm not even sure I'll make it to the end of this week."
bad,Working at CVS is mentally draining and older technicians think they know it all because of longevity of employment. I was a Tech II unlike the rest of the older employees and did mostly cash register which didn't execute my skills at all. Pay was horrible minimum wage for dealing with prescriptions.
bad,"Low pay, little help, many times no lunch breaks, hardly any bathroom breaks. 1 raise in 2 years only  .33cent more an hour. Only scheduled hours no one else wanted to work. Always busy. Pharma Management totally has favoritism."
bad,"Your not paid enough to be not only a cashier but also doing stock inventory, restocking, photo shop, cleaning building, help with merchandising, record building for customers on cvs rewards and etc."
bad,"Very corporate feeling. Very busy job with very little to no help. Not able to make professional decisions, even when actions are correct still somehow management sites with patients."
bad,Great colleagues but sometimes let down by poor management. Support can sometimes be lacking due to a small company culture. I would not work there again .....personally
bad,"Is all about who u know. If your supervisor like you, you will do whatever. However, if not you will be in a trouble.call center with no job description, you do everything."
bad,"there is a severe need for more staffing at every pharmacy. they value giving customer amazing healthcare and service with little to no staff. we're not able to help each individual patient with the time constraints, the over influx of people with insurance that is only covered at our pharmacy. a lot of people who work here tend to quit and we have a high turnover rate due to poor training and many patients being inconsiderate assuming that we are supposed to give them everything at that exact moment. there just isn't enough time in a day with the number of hours allotted to make every single person happy."
bad,Manager was very unprofessional and talks about employees with other employees. Workers are very lazy and depends on the one willing to work to do everything
bad,"Don't plan on being helped out if you or a family member falls ill. I had encountered an illness myself, and was trying to work with HR getting things squared away, trying to follow company policy. Very unflexible and unaccommodating if you need sick time or to take an LOA for medical reasoning. This company claims to promote ""better health"", but fails to care or support their own if they are to become sick."
bad,"My experience at CVS was pretty awful. While there was exposure to some interesting and complex work, management was terrible. I can't emphasize enough how disappointing the group I worked with was. While these folks were all supposed to project management experts, none of them had any real grasp on what was going on around them. The engagement level with their groups was awful, and they were all fully stuck in their own worlds."
bad,I determine my work goals.  I have a $ goal to meet and its up to me to reach that goal.  I provide all data and updates to leadership weekly - at a high level.  The hardest part of my job is knowing that only I provide this skill.  There isn't anyone here to bounce ideas of of or that can provide a second set of eyes.  Sink or swim.
bad,"I worked in a high volume store, we never had enough staff to do the job required of us.  Management never seemed to take staffing needs into account when assigning working hours to individual stores."
bad,"Overall, the dynamic of this company is not where it should be. The environment is very dull. Not much of a team environment. You show up for work & can call it a day."
bad,A typical day at work is quite busy multi-taking a high volume of inbound calls. Must be very computer literate using multiple screens and navigating the software during calls. Never a slow day!
bad,"lack of communciation"
bad,"Not enough payroll to get all the daily tasks done and take care of the Customer,CVS is always trying to reinvent the wheel when they have something that works they take it away replace it with a system that does not.best part of the job are your co workers and helping your Customers,worst part long hours not enough help weak management."
bad,This is a great company to work for if you are lucky enough to get a good manager. There are more managers than leaders... and in a company this large... leaders are a must.
bad,"I am full time 40 hours a week and cut to 19 hours a week.... "
bad,"Sudbury store was quite stressful and the employees were very cutthroat, the Marlborough store was a great place to work everyone was very welcoming and helpful"
bad,The employees are great to work with but the store manager makes it difficult to complete a task. Being able to give customer service to customers and helping out serves our purpose
bad,Hardest part of job ..15 customers deep and only certain people make any effort to help.. The customers frustration builds and you have to progress through this knowing its not necessary and could be changed. .Being asked to tell them to go to the end of the line while the pharmacist reprocesses . or drive around the building...No rotation in production only jewels that hate the register get to produce.Text medication is ready and nothing found in system?
bad,its okay place to work at I would only recommend if someone needed s job quick there are a lot of things to do in 1 day plus no extra help. Managers must do everything and never get breaks .
bad,"I worked for Caremark for 15 years in various incarnations and roles, with the last role being a supervisor. The company that it was years ago is not what it is today. Employees are not rewarded for years of loyal service and are often phased out or ignored. Hours are long and the pay in many areas compared for the same type of work is in the lower scale. Upper management is coached to force items like location or benefits as “selling points” but frequently are not positive attributes for the company. Benefits are offered but are costly and at the lower end of quality. Paid time off is offered but difficult to take your allotment due to staffing and workload. Depending on the position, advancement can go quickly but then stall out. There are frequent pay issues, often resulting in employees needing to pay the company back due to miscalculations, often with strict deadlines or threats of collections. Yearly evaluation merit increases are well below industry standard even at the highest level of accomplishment. "
bad,Thankless employer with high cost insurance and low compensation for the amount of work they expect to be done. There is such a high turnover they are constantly short staffed and they rely heavily on the employees that stay to do both their own job as well as any other jobs that need done. Most of the management  are disrespectful you can forget about kindness from them they will work you like a dog and still complain about you not doing enough. There is a lack of communication unlike anything I have ever seen first and second shift have had meeting yet third shift is told nothing. I work thirds and have to work every other weekend. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here unless you are desperate and even then keep applying else where for a better work environment.
bad,"Unprofessional, favoritism, biased . Un organized unopen to new ideas suggestions. If issues are expressed to managers regarding supervisors the supervisors are told and retaliate against you"
bad,"Honestly, I don't even know what CVS' core values or cultural statement were when I worked for them - they weren't conveyed to us.  We were given a strict set of timetables and production metrics that we had to meet, and that was about it."
bad,"Averaged 9 to 10  hour shifts, usually 4 days a week, with some shorter shifts mixed in, but often worked 7 to 10 days in a row.  We were expected to skip fifteen minute breaks,  answer phones during lunches, work before punching in and often expected to stay an hour or more after shifts."
bad,"The company's values include ""Innovation"" and ""Accountability""; however the culture does not appreciate any innovation or ideas. The process and management are disengaged and their focus is short term for the next benefit period."
bad,"Little to no training on how to do things"
bad,I would answer calls to rude customers and would often get yelled at on the phone. Management was to very great and it was hard to get along with others that worked there.
bad,"The customers where kind of needy and messy. Kids would just come in the store and play with toys and leave them everywhere. My store manager was moody and didn't know how to talk to people, he would talk down to you."
bad,"Fast paced environment where corporate expects too much from managers, who in turn expect too much from employees. Not paid enough for the stress we are subjected to"
bad,It is a fun place to work because you meet and talk to different people everyday like coming from other countries. If you treat your customer nice/right then they always come back and look for you!
bad,"Typical Retail Pharmacy, fast paced, high volume, only work there if you like that kind of a job, I enjoy working there as long as I am working with professionals"
bad,no life balance. your just a number. easily replaceable. does not accept doctors notes. very stressful work environment. favoritism. treat you like children.
bad,"Short and sweet: I deal with the inventory and I get paid less than a dollar more than minimum wage. The expectations are completely unreachable and  the organization of policies and regulations is not very clear, nor is it enforced consistently."
bad,It was a bit unorganized. The store scoring system and reducing employees work hours were very unusual for this company. There were heavy workload and less hours to execute them. Balancing hours were challenging.
bad,Thought I would stay until the end of time but with increasing work load and less and less benefits and increasing stress levels those dreams quickly ended. In my 17 years there my jobs were outsourced 3 times without the help of re-positioning.
bad,"Depends on your supervisor.  But in general, the burden of all the marketing phone calls can draw you away from your work as a pharmacist.  Usually understaffed."
bad,"Retail setting is very stressful, super demanding with not enough help and definitely not enough pay. Cut hours plus understaffing is a huge problem. Last year I was there raise was about 0.02 percent COO raise was about 13% on his already 900k salary."
bad,This is a customer friendly company. Everything is about revenue and cutting corners (even cutting employees) at the sake of the employees. we're overworked and not given enough help. When things aren't done they act surprised and confused as to why they didn't work out when they know it's because one person cannot possibly complete the task of 10 people. They don't care. They're always threatening to fire people. Complete modules or you'll be terminated. They put your name on a public list for the company to see who hasn't completed what (and is basically as risk for termination).
bad,"Daily filling, repacking, cycle, data entry, compounding., Duties include: Pre packing medication for later use, prescription filling, managing inventory, taking live orders, maintained stock and checked for expired medication"
bad,"At first, I was in the department that was more relaxed and laid back. There was a lot of work to do, but you could handle it with the better management. Since changing departments, the work is more fast paced and it's a lot more stressful. The atmosphere is kind of petty and although they say there is room for advancement, they take their sweet time trying train you for advancement. The pay is not necessarily bad, but you're expected to play a lot of roles for the same pay. I do love some of my co-workers though."
bad,"one of the worst jobs I've ever had - absolutely horrible management, company only cares about numbers and money and does not care about techs at all. They work you like a dog for very poor compensation."
bad,Basically you will be overworked. 30 min lunches. Sometimes have you work more than your regular times shift due to business needs but won't pay you overtime. Management isn't quite helpful.You're going to be doing more than your job title and get paid minimum.
bad,"Great place to start working in 1999.  Once the company, then called LoMed, was purcahsed by Omnicare, everything went down.  All perks and incentives were taken away.  The turnover rate was alarming and the hours of operation led to late nights and no personal time available."
bad,Used to be a great place to work but executive leadership changed and culture changed. Lots of employee burn out. Became very high stress. Job demands exceeded rationality. Salaries were very unequal and low.
bad,"I do not think corporate cares much about Pharmacist Managers, the pressure is always on the techs.  And whatever you do on training is not going to be followed through at stores because the management is horrible."
bad,CVS Health is a love hate relationship.  Customers love the employee's.  CVS loves the customer's.  CVS hates the employee's by not taking care of them.  CVS Health is cheap and have not invested money making the employee Break Room decent.  Hours are alway skeleton and CVS does not care about proper coverage to support customer's.  Stay away.  Toxic work environment from upper management and sly store managers.
bad,CVS is a cooperate base company. The main focus is numbers and not compassion. The work load is always heavy and the expiations are always increasing. The compaction is not equal to the work load.
bad,"Work life balance depends on what shift you work.  It depends on what area of the country you live in.  When I was at the CVS location in Yonkers, a 24 hour store, I worked full time hours, but be careful because even if the opportunity presents itself to where you can work at another location in addition to your home store, you still must not go over 40 hours.  If so, you will get written up.  At one of the CVS locations in NYC, only a couple people have full time hours.  The rest are only part time, working 25 hours at the most. A lot of times, they refuse to schedule you more than five and a half hours so they won't feel obligated to give you a break.  You have to ask for your 15 minutes to have a little bit of a breather.  I learned a lot, but I could have learned more.  The pay isn't that great and management a lot of times isn't all that great either.  CVS used to be a nice place work, according to some of its employees that have been ""demoted"".  It's a shame.  No wonder the turnover is high.  There is no 401(k) plan.  It's an ESPP, which means you buy your stock and there is no company match.  You are given time off, but you are only allowed to use a certain amount of it until it is actually built up or you have really earned it.  Otherwise if you use it and you haven't worked enough to pay it back, they will take it from you at the end of the year."
bad,"Very ""corporate"" company and management style. I rarely talk/work with my manager, but when I do need him he is not very helpful. Upper management (directors and VP) are recently pushing new policies and procedures that do not make sense in my role. I feel like my opinion is not valued/does not matter. Your work life balance and how much you like your job really depends on who your manager is and who your client(s) are. I personally do not like my manager but there are some good managers at my company. Most clients are tough. If you get assigned an easy client you will most likely get assigned another client or 2. Job advancement is awful here. This is the type of position they want to keep you in forever. I have rarely heard of anyone ever getting promoted. 80% of the management and upper management positions are hired from outside of the company. It makes me feel like I am working towards nothing. The only perk of working here is that you get to work from home. The pay is decent, but with the awful things you have to put up with and deal with on a daily basis, it makes you feel under compensated."
bad,I was dissatisfied with the work atmosphere at CVS/Caremark. The training was not uniform & employees like myself were always in fear of suddenly losing our jobs.
bad,"Somewhat better than similar jobs in the area.  Still--it's a call center, and you have to take that in consideration when looking at the overall mix of the place."
bad,Since cvs has bought omnicare a lot of people have left. Omnicare employees are underpaid and over worked because lack of employees. No communication btw management.
bad,Management was pretty terrible calling us in last minute and expecting never following through with time requested off. Honestly there is better money to be made waiting tables
bad,"It used to be a great place to work but since the buy out and bad management decisions, we are forced to work a minimum of 50+ hour a week.  Some even more and we do not get over time."
bad,A typical day at CVS is a good day for learning. There are many things to learn with this job especially in customer service. The store in general is easy and precise to manage. The culture of this job is rich and can be a great learning tool for how to deal with issues in customer service and also retail and could help with people skills in total whether in personal life or with a job. The hardest part of this job is trying to brighten up a customer's day or find a way to make their day easier when there seems to be a problem. The most enjoyable part of this job is feeling that my assistance to someone helped them in some way.
bad,"Their mentality is "" everybody is replaceable"" and with that they don't care about their employees. No acknowledgement, no appreciation. The scheduling is the worst."
bad,"High turn over, small group of core employees that try very hard.  Upper management neglectful of employee needs and morale. Working 12 plus hours per day for more than 4 months in summer and no idea or plan by upper management to ease burden.  Facility monetary overhead is low, public subsidies in the form of tax breaks etc., a work force that is desperate and desolate due to lack of jobs allows upper management to continue its poor treatment of employees. Also only place I have ever worked at that management says it is easier to make rate in some areas of the warehouse than others yet performance is still measured by rate and if you are in a difficult area this difference is not taken into account."
bad,"A typical day at work if your only job isn't working the register is to stock shelves, display promotional items, and clean."
bad,If you think you can trust management team at cvs you are wrong. They will make it a great place to work at but people leave or get fired as fast as they come in.
bad,"Manager wasn't experienced - wanted to be everyone's friend instead of distribute assignments fairly. Very stressful environment, language barrier with Spanish speaking customers caused a LOT of confusion, anger between customers and pharmacy. I got nationally certified and gained experience through CVS and got out of there as soon as I possibly could after that!"
bad,"CVS Caremark is notorious for layoffs, they do not compensate their associates for the work that is completed. Management lacks people skills. I would not recommend this company."
bad,"Typical day involved handling cashier duties. When not handling cashier other tasks such as stocking,photo,tossing out expired products, and facing store. Every day a new task was set and was met most of the time, however as a cashier you our left out and in a sense left for dead while at the register. Managers have attitude when you do call for backup or just take their time until line builds out of control. Not much was learned while working a year plus at CVS. Besides channeling my anger whenever a rude customer came across. Some staff and management were actually very friendly and welcoming. I was late 4 out of 5 shifts per week and these were met with no more than some write ups to cover the managers tails. Although managers expected employees to want to work the holidays and weekends while management has those days off. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers. Most enjoyable were some of the people I met during my time there. Not a place to apply if your looking for a company with raises or promotions. Somewhere to apply if you just want to exist and make $10 an hour. One more thing I may add their employee incentives are a joke. I think i'll have to correct myself and say I did receive a raise of about 8 cents. Yay!!"
bad,"I would not recommend this company as a temp placement. the culture does not support the proclaimed goal of temporary to permanent hiring. The coworketrs , howere are excellent."
bad,my family come's first and all I have is my kids and husband left but I am a very hard worker at work and I come to work to do my job and nothing else
bad,The company makes many changes as they grow and dont concider how it effects the employees. The lack of monies provided for the job you do is sad. Lack of training to do the job at hand and being thrown into more difficult roles with out the best knowledge.
bad,this company was not fair to all employees. they had their picks. I did not have a chance to use my skills to the best of my abilities. the hardest part of my job was not being able to complete my work due to the lack of production work being given to supervisors pets
bad,This job isn't a career move for the future. It's an entry level type of job to gain experience for the medical field. The pay isn't great but it's something to get by with if you're in school or down on your luck. Depending on the store you're in the staff that is there can be a '10 or a '0' on the friendly scale.
bad,Very poor management. It's run by a couple of people who are under qualified and don't know how to run a pharmacy. They play favorites which is what probably led them to try and fire me. Luckily I quit before they could. But they expect you to cram in 50 hours of work into 40 hours a week plus add on more work and not even consider a pay raise when more work is added on. Watch out for some employees there. There's a couple of brown nosed people there who will be gunning for your job. Management hates it when you try to better your department with ideas that they didn't think about. And they're really stingy about pay.
bad,"Likely would never work there again, work conditions are sub par to say the least and you are compensated poorly for the amount of trouble you have to deal with on a consistent basis."
bad,"At the time I worked there, I can honestly say it was not a place that I would recommend to  friends or family. The pay was not up to standards-employee shortages created more work for others, and constant complaints that the company as a whole is not cohesive, or reliable."
bad,The culture at CVS Health is budget based and resources are not valued until they pass the contractor role phase.    Resources are looked as numbers and the company culture allows the hiring and laying off of contractors to make revenue constraints. This leads to lack of loyalty by contractors and no real ownership to getting work done.
bad,"Little room for advancement"
bad,It was always busy and we were always under staff. I learned a lot from working there. Management sucked because the manger of the store was never there but she always had our back. I loved my co-workers but they had been there for ten to fifth teen years and I couldn't do it for that long. The hardest part of the job was getting cursed out even thought you were doing you job but the customer didn't like the rules and the way that you were doing your job. I just loved helping people.
bad,Technicians are not treated like people try are treated like slaves. They do not talk to you appropriately. You are expected to be quiet and refuse your hand to leave your desk. You are viewed as incompetent if you made a mistake. If you are not friends with management you are treated like you don't exist.
bad,"i stock beer, water, spirits with NO chance of advancement it is a dead end job but i make ends meet las vegas strip is fun place to work"
bad,"very busy, stressful and not customer focused anymore. numbers driven at any cost. demand of things out of employee control"
bad,The job and hours were long and boring with not much to do. Management was disorganized and did not get and adequate break for the long hours
bad,"There is always to much work and not enough techs.  You have to answer the  phones,  ring someone up at pick up,  go to drive thru. ....boss wants it all done at same time.  Old crew gets best stations. You never get breaks and lunches are late a lot of the time.  Kinda not worth working after paying a sitter and  putting gas in the car. The pay is really bad."
bad,"At first i was excited to start working for cvs as a pharmacy technician "
bad,"Was hired part-time but worked full-time hours. Started to ask about full-time pay and benefits etc. Kept being cut short on answers. Co-workers were highly unprofessional, childish and harassment spun me into a whirlwind of emotions everyday. Cried at home every few days after work. Reported to management and corporate and nothing was done. I was dismissed on account of personality mismatch (unprofessional)."
bad,The Harlan store is horrible. Do not apply you will be miserable if you work in the pharmacy. Front store seemed to be okay. But pharmacy is a whole other story. They act like you do not matter even if you know what you're doing. Find another pharmacy to work for if you wish to work in pharmacy. Unless you want anexity from work!
bad,"I am usually on the register though sometimes I work the production table and help with other various tasks. I became a CPhT with 500 hours of work experience here. Co-workers for the most part are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is having the opportunity to learn new things due to the chaotic environment which is due to the high volume of customers and lack of staff on hand. The most enjoyable part of my employment is working alongside my co-workers, the busy pace, and conversing and assisting customers."
bad,"Do yourself the favor and stay away from this place. Management is a joke here, they tell you that they really care about you and your growth, but in reality all this places cares about are the numbers. You cant trust management or the leads because every little detail that you say to someone manages to get out to the entire floor. Get this, there method of the trying to excite everyone is be giving us candy.. Like really? how old do you think i am. Don't get me wrong though, i like that we have the weekend off, but that's really it (sadly). Find something else, don't let the bs that managements feeds you get to your head. Grow your roots somewhere else."
bad,"Initially,  I was excited to work for this company.   Things were running smoothly because we were taught to do our job duties illegally and incorrectly.   Upper management was relaxed and chill until we started to change policies and do our duties the correct way.   Once this occurred,  the beast face came out of upper management and the ""finger pointing""  occurred.   We were given huge workloads with an impossible expectation to finish it all within 8 hours.   Yeah overtime is great,  but advantage was highly taken over great  and hardworking individuals.   The job duties I had were great and not hard,  but with the misleading guidance and arrogance of upper management, my work environment was mentally draining.  Work and life balance is impossible with these people.   Favoritism and group cliques are high amongst this area of Omnicare.  I saw so many able pharmacists and technicians quit which was appalling.     The last draw was consistently being blamed and pointed fingers at unprofessionally,  about the work we supposedly don't know how to do.   Upper management needs to be brushed up and cleaned out.   I gained experienced dealing with compliance and the pharmacy issues and how to resolve it.   I am sad I had to waste my highly derived skills and time with this company when I could have done that for another company or foundation. It is also sad that one part of upper management was telling us one thing and the other was on a whole different level.   When the finger pointing started, it would only be pointed at the individual contributors.  Also,  once you call out the"
bad,the expectations are set too high and the company provides no tech hours to reach those goals. Everything is about numbers and not patient care. It is more important to them that you scan the patient's cvs card than whether or not you helped them feel cared for.
bad,"The CVS branches are known for always being understaffed in the busier places and this place is not any exception. The staff is incapable in completing tasks, so most of the time the patients walk away dissastified."
bad,Good Management skills and training but only good for people who want to stay at one position instead of moving forward in life.
bad,Patient care is no longer the focus of the business rather the company pays more attention to metrics that is not a measurement of quality assurance. Pharmacist makes so much mistake because of too many task as regards to the metrics KPM system the company runs.
bad,very busy and generally organized. no time for breaks. management is not very helpful. It is very stressful and I find that management is not good at helping the employees decrease there stress. You are not accurately compensated for job well done
bad,"I came into CVS as a certified pharmacy technician and still was underpaid because I had no experience. As it turns out, CVS offers the lowest pay for technicians. In addition to the high level of stress in general due to inpatient customers who feel 15 minutes is an unacceptable wait time, you have pharmacists fresh out of school who can't handle the stress either. As a result, technicians are blamed for anything and everything that goes wrong.  "
bad,This place sucks to work at.  I have been hear for a little over a month and working here is terrible. Managers honestly are worthless and are not interested in helping. Training was okay but I felt like there was still ALOT to learn. The incoming calls are 70% calming angry customers who had bad service from peers. This place needs a lot of work and needs to train better. I feel like I make errors all day long because I simply don't know how to do my job properly.
bad,"Lack of employees in the most busiest pharmacy in staten Island."
bad,"They treat you like you are just another number. We have been told that they can find anyone off the street to do our job. They do not promote a healthy work/life balance. They do not care if you have personal issues out side of work, to them the company comes first."
bad,"Theres so much i can say about cvs that i rather not, my main concern was safety did not feel safe working there a lot of theivs and some shady people"
bad,"Huge lack of training throughout the company.  From the lowliest employee to the boss who knows very little if anything about what their employees do or about how the department is ran in general.  Managers holding back employees from posting to other positions, lack of a team player environment. Low employee morale at least in my location I cannot speak for other locations."
bad,"Fire-drill focused work place, management had little to no interactions with employees, poor benefits, poor communication."
bad,I am currently scheduled from 11:00 AM to 7:30 PM daily. we are taking in new business constantly. However the company has not upgraded our data systems and training to complete the work. I feel the company overall is fundamentally sound. there is an overemphasis on temporary and contract workers who do not always consider themselves as part of the company. Several years ago I was well supported and rewarded for becoming a CPhT. I do not currently see any effort for internal development. I am now looking for a company which will allow me to schedule my return to school to complete a BS in accounting and then to pursue a graduate degree in business administration.
bad,"Your daily job is to make sure the patients get the correct medication. If you are new, you are stuck as a cashier even when you advance during training. The pharmacists would not act like management when a patient has an issue."
bad,"Extremely cheap company that has not respect for thier employee well being. Does not want to provide health insurance to part time workers, tons of useless rules and regulation that have not value."
bad,"the company is good my review is okay, I am just a temp there and they do not want to hire me. A good hard job that I like but I need something long term and not temporary."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is that there's not enough hours in a day to get every tasks (besides filling prescriptions) required by the company done. AND CVS kept cutting technicians hours, which makes the whole working experience very stressful.  The most enjoyable part of the job, ironically, is hearing customers saying they feel bad for us because they could see the pharmacy staff ""running around"" to get things done as timely as possible.  Having customers who are understanding really brighten our days."
bad,"I learned at CVS Health that working smart and being dedicated to the job doesn't mean you will be rewarded with a raise. I learned some variable lessons there that I was forced to take to another employer; I was refused a raise two out of the three years I worked there. I was given a lame excuse for not earning a raise. As a result I felt mistreated and discriminated against so I quit and found another job where I could utilize my education and skills including the skills I learned at CVS Health.  A wise management team would work to retain employees instead of holding back on a twenty five cent an hour raise and losing a good worker. Companies spend thousands of dollars a year training new employees and losing them over a few pennies which means they have to hire a new employee and spend even more money training new hires, this is one of the biggest reasons for high turnovers."
bad,"CVS is an okay company to work for if you literally have no life and would like to dedicate yours solely to them. They try to be flexible with your hours at first, and then you will start receiving phone calls everyday asking if you're available to come in on your days off, and they will make it seem like it is your obligation to. They keep it understaffed and cut hours constantly thus making it hard to complete your tasks in a timely fashion. You cannot take breaks here because there are not enough employees to keep everything functioning while you are gone. I am all for multitasking, but it is very difficult to even get one thing done when its just you and the pharmacist working. This is also a very low paying job for the amount of work that you put into it. The only plus I would say about this job is the knowledge about medications and the experience. Overall, I am very unsatisfied."
bad,"A typical day of work was incredibly stressful and hectic. I did up too 200 prescriptions a day with a drive through. I am experienced with being under pressure and getting the work done. But, the quality of life for Pharmacists and Technicians suffers greatly. CVS forgets about the patients and wants their workers to do too many miscellaneous work that defers from why people come to us for their medication. Prefer a hospital environment which is why I left."
bad,"My co workers and customers were the best thing about CVS. I enjoyed building relationships with the customers, and especially helping the more elderly customers who didn't really have family help."
bad,When I was there the company was under sanction. The managers and the supervisors was unclear on the direction we would take. Customer service reps were left on the phone trying to assist customers but did not have the correct answers. When some information was provided. Reps could help the customers a little more but this information was not provided until months later. At that point CVS started firing people left an right. People who had been there for years were fired for giving out wrong information or CTM's when management was not clear of the information.
bad,"Typical day would be anything other than your own work.  Always having to ffix problems left behind from the previous shifts before able to work on yours. "
bad,"The company went down hill since the implementation of a program which tells the manager/pharmacy supervisor when a certain number of people should be working etc.  Sorry but a computer program is not going to know when to schedule employees... "
bad,I went through their training to become a Pharmacy Technician and the pay was not enough for the amount of work that is expected of you.
bad,"Totally disorganized. Was told at hire the job was Mon-Fri 8 am -5 PM, no weekends and only voluntary overtime, Holidays off. It was 7 days a week. From 8 am till 11 pm, mandatory overtime and worked all holidays."
bad,"Really busy with limited help. Too customer service oriented, majority of prescriptions aren't filled by promised time."
bad,"Responsible for overall coordination and processing of new patient medication orders.  Learned the different types of insurance benefits and how it affected patient's lives."
bad,"Ok wasnt bad...Good job...Good advancement..Fun..Learned warehouse  life..Boriing some days ...Over night shifts ok"
bad,"CVS didn't offer a structured atmosphere, we had no quality, you performance was based on what the Supervisor's felt you were able to do, and if things were to become personal you rank poorly, when professional ranked somewhat equal to most."
bad,CVS is not the type of company you can grow with there is a lot of favoritism.
bad,"like someone posted when I was first inquiring about CVS, Its the type of Job you work for a ""Season"", gain some retail experience and move on!"
bad,"While the actual work can be very rewarding, the benefits usually go unnoticed due to the large amount of stress and little help given to the pharmacy staff.  Corporate expectations are unreasonably high, especially during busy times of the year such as holiday season.  It is not uncommon to come home feeling both physically and emotionally drained, dreading the next day at work."
bad,I was never given the hours I was promised. The manager are indecisive and not customer oriented. My manager went over hours and we were punished for his mistake all of our hours cut causing us to lose money ourselves when he lost nothing.Great people nice environment but the staff is just not what it appears to be.
bad,my day start by preparing my cards for my work shop or going to help out where needed I've learn how important being a pharmacy tech is and I've learn how uncaring management can be I work with some beautiful people the hardest part of my job is getting up to go there. The most joy is the workers I work with
bad,"CVS is a multibillion dollar company and the reason they stay this way is because their workers are underpaid.  Every CVS employee is looked at as a suspect more than employee."
bad,I dis like working at CVS Pharmacy the Loss prevention department is ran horrible. Management doesn't own up to their mistakes instead they blame employee's
bad,"low pay, no promotion. can be tiring and very boring, they send you wheraever"
bad,"This is a busy location, which I love!! Very little down time. My time is spent retrieving patients filled prescriptions and getting payment for each one. If patient has any questions handing them off to the Pharmacist on duty. "
bad,"Managers do not provide clear expectations, nobody wants to do their job because nobody's job roles are clearly defined. Company is too concerned about their public image and decisions reflect that rather than the good of the people who work there."
bad,"Co-workers are supportive of each other, but required daily tasks crammed in an 8 hour shift takes an above average worker 12 hours to finish.  Company's demand of their employees include but not limited to almost no bathroom break, no lunch-break, and not a second wasted because every click of the keyboard and time spent on the phone are recorded and graded and converted to a formula that is equated to PATIENT CARE."
bad,"The job in itself is great and somewhat rewarding.  Company lacks on the job training, no communication, broken promises, no leadership.  Doesn't allow breaks when it states in their policy."
bad,"great customers, and employees were great to work with.the hardest part of the job was family was considered last.management could of been better. not enough appreciation"
bad,"I worked about 10 months for this place everything started out wonderful but it hit a hard left  after the 3month. Basically I dealt with co workers attitudes. Pharmacists talking down and yelling at you in front of patients. When you ask for help your basically own your own. Management sucked, brought up these issue and did nothing. Oh and hours and pay sucked. Never know what to expect when you get your check."
bad,"I been with the company for  years and it feels like prison. When I started off years ago it use to be fun but now it feels like a crime to have fun with corporate breathing over your neck and watching every little thing  you do. I'm currently looking for another job because I'm no longer happy with the company I feel like the turn overs are EXTREMELY high, no chance of advancing opportunity and we do way too much to get paid very little and not to mention we have yet to receive our yearly raise and benefits suck...Im also a believer that the company discriminates against certain race. Overall its A very stressful company to work for ESPECIALLY for all managers."
bad,"Stressful environment, customers are difficult to deal with"
bad,"I worked for CVS/Pharmacy previously and thought my transition back would be an easy one but due to a lack of leadership and accountability in the pharmacy making this  the most challenging part of my job."
bad,"I began with CVS as a sales associate after having managed a convenience store for 2 years. When I was hired I made it clear that I was there to work hard and move up. Shortly after my start date, which was prolonged by a month, a new manager was brought in who knew nothing about how things worked. I, as promised, worked whenever i was needed due to call outs or availability conflicts. Meanwhile, I completed all of the required training modules to become a shift supervisor. When I approached the manager about the possibility of filling that role (We had 2 shift supervisors, and both were leaving in the same month). I was told I was unable to move up because I had been written up for mishandling cash. The reason this is a problem for me is that policy stated that each cashier would start their shift with a fresh drawer. The manager did not feel like counting the drawers that day so 2 of us cashiers ran on the same register all day. so who was really short?"
bad,"I have learned much about medication during my time at CVS. I have learned about drug usage, treatments, mechanism of action, off label uses, etc."
bad,"While being employed here I have seen many dishonest and impractical actions taken by the management staff. Instead of solving problems with staffing they try to cover the problem with very short term solutions that include requiring many people to perform job functions outside of their primary position while giving no additional compensation or recognition. Add overtime for unnecessary training to schedules with little to no notice to employees. Offer schedule changes that are not based on job performance forcing many people to take impractical schedules without compromise. Many of the supervisory staff are very friendly and try to help as much as they can though, so it is good to know the poor practices are not completely unnoticed."
bad,You are overworked & they expect the impossible. They need to realize everything is not black & white.
bad,"I have been working with this company since 2010 and I am not happy with the way employees are not shown any appreciation for doing all that they do every day. No raises, even in the 4 years I have been working here I dont see any advancement in this company. I feel that all of cvs employees feel over worked and underpaid. Very short staffed."
bad,I prepared prescription drugs for the public. Organized and stocked medications. Kept accurate records.
bad,My day starts at 9 AM.  I answer calls from Doctor or an associate of the dr office.  I also put appropriate overrides in the system is the prior authorization.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with poor management with Xerox.  The part that I enjoy is speaking with different people on the phone and trying to resolve an issue and help the caller.
bad,Not a bad job but they don't pay very well and the hours aren't great.
bad,"overall it was a company I felt had no respect for its employees,"
bad,"This is probably one of the worse company I have ever worked for. I was only there for 3 months and it's the worse 3 months of my life that I will never get back. They slaves their employees to death! all they care about is how many referrals they get per day than their employees health.. And the pay isn't really worth the stress. The supervisors, management and lead for the teams could careless about concerns on the job. The people are ghetto and no respect for their teammates. It's horrible! There's no incentives or room for growth at all. My training was a joke! You can't grow working at this company, what they described is totally false. You're better off finding another place to work for."
bad,"All in all, working @ CVS was enjoyable, learned many things about all different products.  Management was always fair and understanding if any problems occurred personally.  All employees were great to work with and being fun place to work doing a job as well."
bad,I liked my job until my coworkers took to joking around and messing with my home life its ok to be friendly and have fun at work its another to say things jokingly and let things get out of hand
bad,"A disorganized environment that is not well-managed.  A very fast-paced workplace that was cobbled together.  I believe the biggest obstacle in this company is the fact the growth was not organic, but rather pieced together through acquisition.  This leads to cultural hurdles and many employees voiced concerns that largely went unnoticed"
bad,"There is no recognition for any employee. The hours are long and tiresome, no breaks or any meal time!"
bad,"the typical day begins with mostly being on the cash register for 7-10 hours putting up tobacco products and struggling to answer customers problems on and off the phone between other people. ive learned photo processing pictures,signs,cleaning, facing, truck, price cuts, credit items, refunds,register,and money gram. the management is poor things are never done correctly people dont take responsibility for what there suppose to do, they dont seem to listen to your outside schedule, your limited to the amount of time for your tasks in between customers, the best part of the job is helping the customer meeting new people learning new skills."
bad,Supervisors focus on metrics that are near impossible to meet.  There are never enough hours to accomplish workload.  Patients often wait hours for their prescriptions.
bad,"Low pay, lots of confusion in the office, old computer platforms, management not up to par."
bad,"Went in at 10:00pm and ran a cash register, cleaned the store and, stocked the store."
bad,"I work as a pharmacy tech. It is a good job, for a college student. You can make decent money to put yourself through college. CVS pays very little for the amount of work you do. The rate that you get paid is not even near the market rate. The performance pay raises are small. They love to give you more responsibility but they will ony pay you for it.  This is only my view. I enjoyed the people I met. I have made friendships with customers and co-workers. I like the 20% employee discountl."
bad,"Worked for many years here first few years I loved my job, until the best management team was fired and all new management was brought in and it became a nightmare, the better you were at throwing people under the bus and kissing up, then you were promoted didn't not matter if you knew your job or not...they wanted puppets working under them... I left after a few years of working for these incompetents....I would say this was the worse job I have ever had..to bad too, as it was a great place to work....."
bad,"Customers are incredibly rude which is to be expected, but you'll work with unqualified technicians that are paid just as much as you because they refuse to give you a raise. Management ignores any issues, and if a co-worker is lackluster then corporate punishes EVERYONE."
bad,Overall I was not their long enough but the people were very nice.
bad,The best part of my job was helping my customers. I liked helping but the pharmisist made it hard.
bad,The more you give the more they want...dead end job. Management walks around clueless most the time and middle management is even worse
bad,Overall fun place to work and great way to learn new things. Management was grouchy and negative on all employees.
bad,"Not family friendly,they do not want a balance of work/family its them or nothing.You will be given occurences for everything so pray that you never get sick,that family never gets sick that everything runs perfect all the time.better yet look elsewhere for a job.Management will treat you like a number and expect you to be like a machine."
bad,"They recently updated their computer system to something called WECARE, however, it infact shows how much we do NOT CARE. Sounds funny, but I think the basics for the system were made for smaller volume stores, however, my store 4843 is suffering majorly from the swap due to being the only chain pharmacy for 10 miles. Computers crash, glitch, and even freeze preventing us from the already hectic workflow we all have to endure. On top of that, the customers are furious when their perscriptions are taking 2 hours to be processed, counted, and verified off because of said glitches and errors. I loved my job before the new system, but highly recommend you consider asking if they are low or high volume before even applying for the job. It's too stressful for someone like myself with no prior pharmacy experience. Honestly, it's asking for someone's death from being so rushed in this process."
bad,"not enough employess, overworked underpaid"
bad,CVS is not the best place to work. The store I work at in particular has management issues. It's very difficult to take your job seriously when not all employees are held to the same standards.
bad,"Busy, customer contact most of the day. Contacting doctors, insurances and updating customers on daily basis"
bad,"1) Typical day at work would be adding a patient into the computer & data entry, then entering in the prescription in the computer, filling the prescription & handing it over to the pharmacist to review & then cash out the patient."
bad,A typical day at work was challenging. You have to stand for 8 hours and always stay busy. I learned that it's best to work at your own pace to cut down on mistakes. The cool thing about the job is they have a big cafeteria so you don't have to worry about your diet or nutrition.
bad,"Its retail, so you will always have good and bad customers. Since I was in the pharmacy, not only did we have customers we had healthcare providers and insurance companies."
bad,"Over Worked, Under Paid"
bad,Good store location until the need for the corporate transfer which brought new management along and seperate expectations beyond the usual work manner.
bad,"Understaffed, overworked, exhausting job environment. I dont believe they care about employee satisfaction or liability. Everyone complains about the lack of help, support, and pay for the amount of work that needs to be done."
bad,"It is very fast-paced in the pharmacy, and there is a mountain of tasks to accomplish by the end of the day, most of which doesn't get done in time, and it is common to fall a day or two behind, if not more. With hours cut and fewer pharmacists and techs to work at a time, it can be very overwhelming."
bad,"The only thing that kept me going back, was the people I worked with! The right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing as far as management and supervision goes!"
bad,"The program for orientation was completed unorganized, the Pharmacist at my location were immature and disrespect you each other. That lady the working environment terribly stressful.  CVS must allow any random employment and the employees that already working there would be in tears every shift. Rediculouse!"
bad,"Listen. It’s retail in a chain pharmacy, we all know how it goes. I think my location is likely worse than others. Sometimes I moonlight at another location than my main store and to be honest it’s better there because of the management, though it can vary by who is running the shift. My main issue is that I don’t feel management at my store lives up to its responsibility to advocate on behalf of its employees — for example, we recently switched to automated check out and have received a significant number of poor reviews via customer service surveys, and very little is done by management to communicate day to day issues with the DM and corporate at large so our hours have been cut due to lowered store rankings from the surveys. Management also seems disinclined to intervene when customers cross a line — for example, today a customer raised his voice at me for a prolonged period while a shift supervisor stood two feet away silently watching the incident unfold. I do not feel supported or even actually managed/supervised by the leadership in my store and wish I had an ally to turn to when things get tough."
bad,"You’ll be lucky if you get the hours that you need to survive, part-time or full-time. Raises are a joke. If your part-time you could end up with no hours on any given week because they don’t have to give you any hours if you’re part time. If your full-time will give you at least 30 but you’ll be lucky if you see more than that. Management can be horrible. People fight over being in production versus helping customers."
bad,"The constant juggling of unrealistic expectations.  Includes a lengthy list of calls that resemble spamming.  Work is mostly quantity, not quality.  No real times a really left for doctor calls to resolve issues or use clinical knowledge to patients.  The expectation is to provide great customer service to an unsurmountable number of clients.  An expectation that neither the company or employees believe is possible."
bad,They run the pharmacy department with limited technicians it makes the job stressful not a healthy place to work. They limit the hours to their liking with no notice to the point that it affects the quality of life to their employees
bad,"Salaried people don't get paid extra although it is very likely to work over time. During December and January, it is required to work 7 days a week, at least 70 hours."
bad,Work live balance is terrible. Constantly cutting hours and understaffing is a norm. High stress with very little payoff. The employees are usually great but management destroys what little joy you have in your coworkers. It is a daily grind without lunches and breaks.
bad,The company supports a culture where there is limited support for people who are placed in new roles.  There is a culture of managing out instead of mentoring.
bad,Company changes every few months. SOP changed daily and patient care is nill. Managed by clique coworkers .  Temp agency workers make more than company workers and then they don’t have to do the work
bad,Company is slowing falling apart and getting away from retail store fronts which makes sense being a pharmacy. The pharmacy side is successful and that's where the money is made.
bad,"The work/life balance is nonexistent. Want to spend time with your family? Forget about it. They will find every single excuse to have you work at nights when you've been working for more than 4 years. "
bad,"The work load is through the roof, expectations are impossible to meet with bare minimum hours and under staffed pharmacies. Corporate couldn’t care less. You are over worked and under paid at CVS."
bad,"It was an ok experience. There was no overall direction."
bad,Your schedule depends on your direct manager. They will tell you something  once & expect you to remember everything. Not a reasonable learning curve. Bring a reporters pad & write EVERYTHING DOWN. I think the  younger you start the better. They are not very forgiving of age or disability.
bad,"Run! Run far away.  It is truly amazing the lack of support you are accorded in this company.  You are not properly trained, or it's rushed.  Very difficult to retain good people."
bad,"Totally under paid for the amount of work employees do, and especially supervisors who work excessively long hours, are expected to cover call outs, work extra, eTc during busy seasons only to be cut down to minimum hours after holidays for many months without a say. Little to no management opportunities even with longevity with the company and lots of ‘who you know’ politics to try to get promotions. A waste of 5 years of my time."
bad,"I am a hard worker and very efficient but the times on picking orders was ridiculous. I achieved very high quality yet my time wasn’t always acceptable. You could get written up for this. It didn’t matter if you showed up on time, got along with everyone AND worked hard. I think the engineer who set the times was either a sadist or didn’t know what went on on the floor. I think they did this on purpose so workers would quit and the company wouldn’t have to pay benefits. Turnover was very high."
bad,"I worked as an assistant manager. The stores in my area are shoplifted daily. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars walk out of each store, a day. You are tasked with ""doing whatever it takes"" to stop such theft. Apparently, giving discounts to police officers is not one of those things. In their eyes, this is considered theft. I would think that incentivizing police officers to frequent the business more often, would be a priority, but they value their shoplifters more. I have also seen loss prevention detectives let go for just doing their jobs."
bad,"I have been a shift supervisor for 5 years. My current store manager is great! He does what he can with what he has, although corporate does tie his hands a lot. Pay is fine, but almost not worth the mental anguish you go through to work there. Hours are not flexible. Schedules are 3 weeks out, but change on a dime (with no notice depending on your store manager). Company cares for customers, but not for employees. Open holidays and if you are fulltime, you can not request time off during nov/dec. Scheduling your life is a difficult task. Back to back shifts are common, so forget your sleep. (And NO, you can not work only mornings or only evenings, which is fair to keep employees from hogging all of the decent hours. However, closing and then coming back 6 hours later is frustrating and should not happen as often as it does. Especially 4 times in a row when I live an hour away)"
bad,"With a manager change on average every six months, eventually you're going to get one who blocks your attempts at advancement and doesn't much care for you."
bad,You have to self mentor/train as nobody have time to train you on the job. you have to setup the pace for workflow accurately otherwise things will go very hectic.
bad,Working for CVS Health as a pharmacy technician will drain you and the pay is not worth it. They have changed their system to where you work yourself to death only to have more work dumped on you without the help.
bad,This CVS store is full of drama. The store manager talks about employees behind their backs does not fix ongoing issues and does not listen to employees concerns.
bad,The environment is extremely stressful! There is a constant increase in work load and a constant decrease in resources. Salaried managers are expected to make up for this by working more hours for the same pay.
bad,"The Most Difficult Part is dealing with the ""Corporate"" hounding."
bad,The management takes favoritism they only write up people they don’t like . Only the management get decent hours. You don’t get ur break on time. A lot of young workers with no knowledge and values.
bad,I work the overnight shift and they do not provide you with security. There are only two employees in the store and they expect you to clean up the whole ready for business the next day.
bad,"Always short staffed, compensation was decent but still not worth the stressful environment  I was always asked to stay late, come in early, and even on my days off"
bad,"Over my 8 years of working for the company, they have gone from focusing on patient care to focusing solely on money and metrics all while cutting hours to stores so that every year you have to do more with less."
bad,The only enjoyable part of job is knowing I am helping sick people get better. Customer service should always be a big part of any company. Lately customer service seems not to be important as much as pushing new programs (even to people on limited income). $$ numbers are what matter the most now .
bad,"A person can definitely make or break a job.  When I was hired it was great and then I got a new manager.  He sat in the office all day and even napped.  He insulted people and laughed it off as a ""joke."" He would never work holidays or Saturday nights.  Almost never helped put out the truck.  Broke CVS policies and the DM didn't see much of an issue, even encouraged him. It was constant chaos."
bad,"CVS stores are highly disorganized and Management micromanage your every move. If you are fixing the chips isle be prepared for a manager to watch over your shoulder. This company has zero trust for their employees, we are subject to bag checks and we have different purchasing privileges than customers. I’ve found myself walking after work to a different CVS store just so they can honor a rainche kcoupon. Overall, the job itself is easy to collect a paycheck. However, CVS will do very little to show employee appreciation. We are watched 24/7, which is beneficial for the company. But be prepared to be watched at all times"
bad,Output out ranks every other job application.  Disgustingly dirty bathrooms which are never professionally  cleaned. Useless district manager.  Unhappy coworkers. Usually understaffed.
bad,"As a manager for an inner city store, I was at my store weekly by 5:45 am bringing in inventory shipment alone."
bad,"The district leader didn’t even interview me, she had another store manager who happened to be there interview me while she took a phone call for my scheduled interview time. The store manager who took me on to train me had about a weeks notice I would be starting in his store. I was manipulated into believing it would be my only opportunity to have a store before I would be pushed out of the company. I did not complete my basic required training before taking a store. During my time as a store manager I was told By my district leader I wasn’t allowed 30 minute breaks, that my 45 salaried hours wasn’t realistic and that I needed to be in my store at least 60 hours a week. Fast forward 9 months and I’m out. Over worked, underpaid for the expectations they have, terrible upper management, hours continuously decreased while work loads increased. So much lost time with family. So much of a negative impact on my health both physical and mental. Do not work managing those stores. Not worth it."
bad,"Job was easy, but they had about 100 things for you to do before shift ends. Horrible pay for all the work and customers are nasty. Short breaks, low pay, rude customers, too many tasks, to much gossip at work, so cheap they don't even buy vacuums so they'd rather you sweep the disgusting carpet. All around I don't recommend working here, not even compensation for good customer service."
bad,It's an ok company to work for as far as co workers and customers. The pay for management is really on the low side. The only way you can get full time is to work extra shifts.
bad,Poor training. You work through your lunch as a pharmacy tech and management tries to not pay you for it. Dirty facilities as well as unhygienic pharmacy techs
bad,Lost my work/life balance. developed health problems. learnt a lot about effective leadership and problem solving. The work environment will break you if you are not strong enough
bad,"Training was not up to par to prepare one to be a pharm tech.   Co workers are too busy to assist you if you get stuck."
bad,"District manager was terrible, rude, and overall not enjoyable to be around. The store manager was nice and friendly. I noticed that the district manager was making the store manager do what he wanted not what was best for the store manager and the employees."
bad,Poorly managed. Changed schedules all of the time. Did not want to pay overtime. Was not family oriented or caring. Did not want anyone to advance. Poor pay for what the job called for.
bad,"Terrible management "
bad,"Even if you stay at your desk 24/7 and keep your stats up you're still never doing enough. Oddly enough every new policy the company enacts makes it harder to help patients. "
bad,We get along we do our best business go well but some managers make their own rules. Working in the pharmacy is better. Helping the customers is the best part of the day.
bad,a lot of training modules gets you in the door and get used to it. All the pharmacies are under stress right now. It is a learning environment; the less said the better.
bad,"My role for CVS Coram sounded glorious during the interview process. “Decent pay, flexible schedule, etc”. Going into this role, from day 1, I was not given the position I applied for. Second, hours were never outlined, and days were dictated by another’s laziness. Colleagues looked after themselves, the manager was lacking, and nursing in general had no guidance from management."
bad,Pharmacy and front store are completely different atmospheres. Working in pharmacy was easy and fun. It flowed and was very functionable. The customers made the job unbearable. I would be yelled at nearly everyday. I would say on average I went home to cry 3 days a week.
bad,"Training for the customer care role was not sufficient. The work environment is very stressful and demanding. The company has unrealistic metrics for what they expect to be done on a call, and do not allow enough time to do the job properly. Every week we would be coached by team lead, with what we needed to improve. It was a constant threat of being fired if we could not meet metrics. Never got acknowledged for what I was doing right. The only good thing about this job was most members I spoke with were very pleasant and thankful."
bad,Boss hired friends over good workers and promoted. Harassed mentally and sexually by a member of management reported and nothing done. You get a union that doesnt care and a work place that wants u to pull 16 to 24 hour shifts last minute.
bad,"IT management culture towards delivering rather than caring. Strong check process through SDLC to deliver code. Because of checks, slow on-boarding process which can take weeks and a very low possibility of learning and applying new technologies. Developer team colleagues had great potential laid to waste and there is a lack of cohesion and standardization across different developer teams. Great place if interested in standstill and retire. The most enjoyable part of the job was to meet people interested in doing things better and to know a corporate SDLC process (and puzzles and coffee in the break room!). The hardest part of the job was to do nice implementations while reconciling with management, delivering and internal practices and checks. Finally, what I learned is what I improved for the company, self-taught."
bad,The initial transition from Target to CVS was ok for a while..Target management was awesome but slowly CVS culture took over and they cut pharmacist AND tech hours but demand results and productivity.
bad,To many white faces and people  that have been there longer can get there way   if they complain   it's not a diverse place to work if your not in a certain  group.  Forget it  .they do things for certain  people  that they like
bad,"Pay is good, work environment/tech support hours/job security etc. is very challenging. The system is ok, but things seem to constantly change, sometimes not for the better."
bad,It’s a good place to work if the managers didn’t take on such a high volume of work and expect the same amount or less staff to fulfill those needs. The atmosphere is not climate controlled and the heat is unbearable with trying to work at such a pace to meet your personal goals for the day. Management does nothing to help aide in such conditions and comes down on you for not reaching your goals.
bad,Overall this company may be okay to work due however the department Omnicare sucks and no once should apply here.  They only cares about numbers not employee.   Favoritism is at an all time high.   That's all
bad,You are always trying to multitask so you can fit 24 hours of work into an 8 hour shift.  All the hard work results in field managers coming in and telling you all efforts are not good enough
bad,"No 15-minute breaks even though policy states it should be happening. "
bad,"While working the second shift, from the time you clock in to the time you clock out, management always seems to be looking for something to write up associates to get them in serious trouble. Even for minor things they look to write people up while at the same time ignoring OSHA standards."
bad,Very poor management. Dispatchers don't know what they are doing. You are forced to work long hours during busy season. The only good thing about working here are the benefits.
bad,"Management doesn't care how sick you are, they don't care about anything but your scores. They are extremely strict with metrics and there isn't any coaching available. The hours also suck with mandatory OT in January totaling about 20 extra hours. Training was decent but HR really doesn't know what they are doing most of the time. Also, it is a NON-SMOKING campus meaning you can not smoke on your two 15 minute breaks since you can't leave the grounds, you have to wait till your lunch.  "
bad,"New hire rentention is almost none. Unattainable goal made while being understaffed. Unexpected mandatory overtime is the root of the issue. ABSOLUTELY NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. Any day given off is a makeup day. Pay is market rate, but still terrible for NJ. 2 20 min breaks no half hour lunch and breaks go fast especially walking from one side of the warehouse to the next. They are nowt trying a  failing attempt of implementing tablets instead of paper picking, but continue to give out 3 foot long receipts in the store. I have been here 3 years and work with almost none of the people I worked with when I started. New hires quit because of work life balance."
bad,Pay is decent if you worked what is required but as a store manager you have to work about 60 hours or more a week to try and keep up. They cut payroll every year and you barely have anyone working with you. Expect no home life as a manager.
bad,"Work/home life does not exist, they expect you to run a store on less than minimal hours and demand that you support your pharmacy which also has not hours to operate and still get your work done. The fact is that the purchase of AETNA has cut the store hours to an unacceptable level while senior management have no compassion or concern for store level colleagues."
bad,"Working retail anywhere is stressful, but it seemed much worse at CVS. A great place to learn customer service because of the focus they have on the customer, but it'll cost you your dignity as many customers use clerks as their emotional punching bags. Other skills that could be learned here include, Communication, Leadership, Organization, and Time-Management. "
bad,Management are bullies. No real training. Trainers are horrible. Nothing like training. Management are all in clique if they don’t like you they will push your buttons. There is favoritism and a lot of it. Very misleading
bad,The company core values are not being demonstrated on a daily basis. Half of the staff are either calling out or inserting them selves into drama and negativity. There seems to be a disconnect on communication within the organization. Patient care should be the number one priority but it is not.
bad,"I could only hope that work/life benefits vary by teams. I was warned to not work here because work/life balance is TERRIBLE. I should have listened. "
bad,Loved meeting and interacting with patients but hard to balance between metrics and patient care...overall I have learnt a lot working here. I have grown from a grad inter to a manger but sometimes support from upper management
bad,Really one of the worst call centers I've ever worked in. The training was a joke. It was Several weeks and my entire class knew almost nothing about how to do the job after training. My manager is almost always unavailable and complete unhelpful when he is. You'll get Lots of critism from management. The raises are a joke. Dont work here unless you really can't do anything else.
bad,"1.Very difficult to hire new people because of the hiring process."
bad,"I think my summary says it all. Co-workers, great, upper management, not so much. Like most corporate companies they are all about the bottom line and the almighty dollar instead of better customer service. Understaffed pharmacies and overwhelmed front in clerks is what you get with CVS."
bad,"You come to work, do your work, never get complimented. Never hear appreciation. Management is a joke. Training is a joke. the real only good thing, is the flexibility to come in any time before 10am without calling to say you'll be late.."
bad,Management does not have knowledge of what they need to be doing as well as job duties. Life balance and scheduling is poor. Job security is awesome. Bonuses are poorly given. Poor Growth within the company. Promotions are given to people outside the company.
bad,All though they do offer some on site training a lot of your license renewals are paid for by you . If you want additional training you have to pay for it . Depending on the store depends on wheater the management team work with you and hours that you need to work . There is poor communication and there is a lot of favorites
bad,"Absolutely no payroll model for the front of the store. Management expected to work alone for hours each day, even in the tough areas. No support from higher management. Lots of opportunity to grow with the company if you aren't burnt out."
bad,"Basically enjoyed working in the front part if the store until i was transferred to the pharmacy. I than began to realize not only was the environment a popularity contest and a repeat of high school gossip girls it was worse when the pharmacist was the leader of the girl group. I did not enjoy going to work to say the least. i did my job and was heckled daily by the pharmacy manager. no how many times i complained or called the ethics line she still kept her job without so much of a slap on the wrist. The absolute worst, horrible pay and hours."
bad,"Waiting on customers, filling & resolution of rx's, answering the phone. Turnover with Pharmacy Managers which is difficult. Hardest part of job is the amount of multi-tasking with little help to get prescriptions out in timely manner. Company is very metric based instead of focusing on customers like they preach. Enjoy helping our customers with all aspects of their health in the most up beat professional and helpful manner."
bad,"I will say that while working at CVS I learned a lot! But working there was still like a living h*ll. The hours were crazy, there was low staffing, the manager wasn't really doing anything to fix that and never made good on his promises. There is no growth with this company. It paid well but only because I always ended up working 8 to 10 hour shifts. And on some days it was a full blown 12 hours. If you work here, be prepared to be burnt out is all.and fell really under appreciated for the service that you give."
bad,"Pay is not good at all compared to other pharm tech jobs out there. They ask for way more than others, with too many corporate visits. Their pharmacy system is quite rudimentary, almost too user friendly ( red: dumbed down) that I found myself constantly at odds to do something simple like looking at a patient's prescription history. And yes CVS does call patients a lot, with no option to opt-out, so you deal with a lot of angry patients."
bad,"If you would like to be overworked and underpaid, work here. They do not care about their employees and they are severely understaffed and do not seem to care. They would rather put all the work off on the few employees they have making them not even want to show up. Because they are so understaffed, it is like pulling teeth to get them to approve your PTO time that you earned. Don't do it.They bring in new employees making more money than the tenure employees and expect them to be okay with that as well. When tenure employees ask for a raise, ""they don't have the money for that."" But somehow they can renovate their building."
bad,Stressful job specially because they micromanage everyone so it doubles the pressure. As every other job you gotta be kissing the right butt in order to be promoted.
bad,"Poor communication, lack of vision, Sr. Leaders are not supportive. No work / life balance. Good salary and benefits / career advancement is difficult."
bad,"When I first started the company focused more on customer service, the patient, good relationships. As years have passed they have made that goal harder and harder. They have decreased the amount of technician and pharmacist hours, increased the required work, decreased compensation. Thought they increased the minimum hourly rate to $11( shocking it wasn't that before) they have kept the same ""caped rate"". Training time/help is shorter with more expectations. Communication has gotten harder because district and regional supervisors have SO much on their plate after redistricting and taking away important intermediate positions. As staff I feel I have less and less autonomy and less power to accommodate my patient's needs. More and more ""programs"" come out from cooperate that bombard the patient, confuse both patients and working staff, and aggravate patients when as staff I can't change or fix issues. "
bad,A lot of things don't make sense at CVS.  A lot of employees are not trained properly and are usually trained by a new cashier anyways.. management is a boys club. They are all buddy buddy.
bad,The company has cut hours so drastically it was impossible to have all the technicians we needed daily.  They care about making money and that is all!
bad,They talk a lot about advancement but there really isn’t any. No consistency and it always feels like they don’t care about their employees. They don’t offer great incentives at all.
bad,"I was hired to do a creative job that would have kept me on my chosen career path. One year in, they changed the duties of the job and derailed my career pushing me off into a rudimentary, dead end non-creative role where i push paper all day. Was stuck (lost) for five years at CVS while I a) figured out what my job title was and what I actually did b) taught myself new skills out of cvs so i could get OUT of CVS. And I RAN out the door first change i got. Horrible. Pay raises were next to null, we haven't seen COLA in so long it's pathetic, and half the computers are old and outdated and they just moved over to Chrome so...yeah...if u like working with outdated equipment at an outdated company with antiquated corporate ideas, this is your place. You will feel right at home."
bad,"Drama got in the way of the facility, became harder to work in the environment. It became toxic and no one was doing what was asked of them. Everything was a joke. The manager abide with your schedule for one week and the next week was inconsistent and the schedule was never according to your availability"
bad,"A typical day at work consist of regular tech duties and almost no help from staff. This is because there is typically no overlap of employees and you are usually on your own. The company adopted a new scheduling system to ""optimize"" the hours allocated for the technicians. The optimization program is all run through a computer software that must keep ""optimization percentages"" above a certain percentage. This is really to cut down on hours as much as possible. It is very rare that any one person will be scheduled for a full 8 hours shift. The most common shifts available after optimization are 4 to 6 hours. You will have to float constantly to other stores to MAYBE reach 30 hours. This company has a high turn around rate and will turn and burn their employees with little to no compensation. They only offer empty promises of a better future and help themselves more than they do their patients. Upper management is always in chaos. Go to Walgreens instead. CVS is one of the least competitive pay employers in pharmacy. Only the union stores have decent pay. Do not expect more than 10 to 15 cent raise per yer. Or any AT ALL!!!"
bad,"My typical day at work is to make sure that your  ready to work ."
bad,"Ugh...just don't. Tons and tons and tons of paperwork. Training never ends and a lot of it doesn't even apply to your job. There is no  HR at the place so you must call or go on  websites to do anything. It's worse than trying to get something done through the IRS. Extreme, extreme picking. Someone is always looking over your shoulder about every tiny thing. There is a rule for everything and then another rule on top of that. Rules are strict-no exceptions. Also, no sick time. Any time you call in is a point-doctor's notes don't matter. Bosses treat people badly. There's a reason there are always job openings at this place."
bad,Management was awful. Unprofessional and unethical. Never felt appreciated or valued for my invested time and loyalty. wouldn't recommend this company for a career.
bad,"CVS can be a great company to work for, but their obsession with external promotion of unqualified candidates while ignoring talent in their own stores is incredibly demoralizing for everyone who has dedicated time and energy to making sure the company succeeds over years of employment. "
bad,"The work atmosphere and morale is  very low due to poor management. Promotions are based on favoritism, not skill base. If you do not have seniority, be ready to carry the brunt of the work and to get the worst schedule."
bad,This company is horrible to work for if you are not part of a clique you will not advance in the company the pay is low and raises are pennies.  The management only comes to you when you do something wrong no recognition when you do well.
bad,"A typical day at CVS includes work work work!  You clock in and am immediately on 10 bc of the extremely fast work pace.  There are a million phone calls, with often one technician having to man multiple stations. Depending and what kind of pharmacist you may have, you may have to do your job as well as some of theirs bc they feel it beneath them.  It depends of who you work for but advancement is not possible unless you know the right people. In my honest opinion, it is a great place to get your feet wet.  If you are looking for advancement, go elsewhere.  CVS does not care!"
bad,Very difficult place to foster correct focus on patient care at the patient level. There are too many time constraints to properly place emphasis on drug interactions and adequately provide counseling to patients correctly.
bad,"As a pharm. tech, is hard doing three peoples jobs because the hours are always getting cut. Coprate pushes vaccines (which is good) and other promps on the registers so much that it actually takes away from customer engagement. "
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy technician at CVS Pharmacy for a number of years. While the experience there did allow me to progress into other companies and medical fields (hospital pharmacy, private sector), i did see those that were not able to make those improvements."
bad,Management is critical of employees and do not support them.  Many co-workers in my department were verbally abused and made fun of by supervisor until super. moved on.  There was not one predominant language (English) spoken in departments so everyone could be on the same terms for processing. Rules and policies inconsistent. There was a tendency to add more job duties but no increase in pay.
bad,"Very fast paced. When I started, could not get trained for position I was hired for as there was no one available to train me. So, I learned several other jobs which were interesting."
bad,"When CVS bought out Omnicare the work place drastically changed and attitudes changed. The atmosphere was not the same. CVS tried to  bring in their policies and they were significantly different from what the employees were accustomed too. The work itself did not change, just the expectation of not being able to celebrate monthly birthdays and have company cookouts. We could celebrate birthdays out of our own pockets vs the company supplying a birthday cake once monthly or sponsoring a cookout for a holiday.  The company would no longer reimburse for tech or pharmacist license."
bad,It was an okay place to work but no room for advancement unless you were a pharmacist. As a pharmacist Tech you have to pursue a career in pharmacy to advance at CVS
bad,The Company was okay while it lasted. I learnt a lot working as a Customer Service Representative - speaking to members of the public and dealing with different personalities in the office.
bad,Working at Cvs Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician is too much i must say. There are pros and cons i can describe but overall it was just too stressful and draining at the end of the day for me. I did learn a lot and therefore i am thankful for the experience.
bad,"Employees are always amazing to work with, even pharmacists are pretty understanding and will work with you through most anything. Pay is horrible for a pharmacy technician that has 2 years experience! No benefits, no over time or holiday pay, I work average 40 hours a week and still am only listed as part-time. I work at a very busy store in a snobby, rich people part of town and the way these customers treat us is sometimes just straight up abuse. At least 10 pages of scripts every time I come in at 9 am, phone is ringing off the hook all day, customers picking up scipts ALL day, you only get a 30 minute lunch break, if you're lucky, as well as being severely understaffed for the 2 years that I've been there! Corporate only cares about numbers and getting scripts out as quickly as possible. No acknowledgment of your hard work, no matter how hard you work corporate still comes in and complains how you aren't doing enough as well as talking down to us. This is a thankless job, do NOT work for CVS if you are looking for decent pay, full time hours and appreciation!"
bad,I would never work for them again.  Hours were inconsistent.  management was terrible.  Training was way overboard for the position.  Onboarding took forever and was complex.
bad,"Work and treat employees like robots and poor pay.  I was hired to enroll 65 enrollments per day and after hired on permanently, they increased the goal to 85 per day.  They know that the system is poor and they company needs to update it but don't take these issues into consideration."
bad,"pay is good but management is not. very stressful environment, if your good in your current position they don't advance you. toxic managers, very cliquey."
bad,Ok a lot of drama unneeded that's why on here looking for a better job that I will enjoy going to. Does not work with people who have extreme issues at home or health issues.
bad,"The job is great if you are looking to make a lot of money but of course be able to put in the work. Paid training for 5 weeks with up to 2 instructors and actual practice while in training. While in training of course they go over company policy and procedures as well as how to work the system. Only down fall of the job are the memebrs, they can make the job a very stresful enviroment especially because most people that you speak with on the phone are 65+ with no conncetion to the modern world that most people that work in this enviroment live in. for example most do not know how to work a computer, or even be able to read the medications written on their bottle to better assit you and themselves. The job can cause a lot of stress and make you burn out and not want to truly go to work past the bare min. Lots of overtime, and it is unlimited. you can leave with a $2,500 paycheck for 2 weeks if your willing to sit there past 8 hrs and come in on your days off, but after awhile of being on the job you dont want to."
bad,CVS Health is by all means not a wonderful place to work.  They have zero work life balance and zero ability to think outside of anything but numbers.  Pay is terrible as is CVS's ability to maintain systems to give us a great place that we want to be at.
bad,"CVS looked like a beacon of opportunity when I first noticed the listing for the pharmacy technician job. I was given a part time position upon being hired, although I had applied for a full time position with open availability. I was promised I would have a full time position as soon as one came available. 4 years later and I’m still part time. I was promised state certification and it never happened. I went above and beyond with my job responsibilities just to be unappreciated. If you work for CVS, I hope you’re really good at kissing butt, because otherwise you’ll get nowhere."
bad,"All stores are different and during the time I was there, stores other than the home store were more enjoyable to work with. Overall the experience working here did expand some knowledge on prescription drugs."
bad,"When I started with CVS they put a lot of effort in to making sure people had some home/work balance.  In the past few years they have changed management styles and are slowly getting rid of the management that believes that people at the store level deserve this type of balance and replacing them with people who have less and less retail experience.  "
bad,i don't see any prospects for advancement for myself in the near future and am looking for a more challenging and rewarding position elsewhere. not pleased with the workplace culture here.
bad,"As a part time pharmacy tech, you get the hours that are left and still do not get to get the days off you need for other responsibilities. Some managers need alot more training."
bad,It is an ok company to work for. Need some work on rules to allow.  Staff is wonderful. Need more room for approvements. Need more help with staffing and management.
bad,"Pharmacy is not adequately staffed with technicians, Pharmacist are cashiers, technicians etc.  CVS should give us technician help and let pharmacists should be pharmacist.  Everything we do is timed by the computer system and our flow is integrated by the computer system and we are judged on the times."
bad,The environment was too stressful.  Pushing the older employees out the door. Not enough help to run the pharmacy right. Too much back stabbing  from other employee’s
bad,"I have been in the company for many years and have taken any promotion that has come my way.  No room for real growth and they don't pay you according to your responsibilities.  Hours are always an issue in most stores and you are always running a store with just two people.  In some areas that are not very safe at night, you won't have security making it unsafe.  Tasks are hard to complete when you're the only person on the floor and also trying to manage.  Customer service will be hard to keep up with and maintaining a clean store.  To actually get a decent pay raise within the company as well, it's almost required to work there for a min of 5 years to make it worth your while."
bad,"Mentorship of employees is selective and inconsistent.  Members of the Leadership Team are not mentored at all. Clear favoritism towards male employees, especially Caucasion males. "
bad,"Could be a great place if the management was replaced. People are hard working and intelligent, but not appreciated.  The environment is so frustrating and sad"
bad,"Most days we were so busy we would not be allowed to take breaks. We would work 9+ hours with no breaks.  We would be on our feet the whole shift, as well. The turnover is so high at the Port Royal location."
bad,very busy and any shift will go fast due to the busy schedules provided. Management is not organized.  Many departments have to much input and it becomes confusing.
bad,the person in charge of scheduling was covered in tattoos and acted very unprofessionally in front of patients. she threatened to cut my hours if i couldn't provide more availability. i had given her 6 days a week availability and was only being scheduled for 2.
bad,"A regular day of work was usually stressful. I liked working there dur to me knowing all my customers after period of time and gaining a greater relationship with them. I will miss that part The pay was not good at all, wasnt treated equal"
bad,"I loved working in the pharmacy half. I was never bored and was used to patients, kind and rude. I absolutely HATED being a regular cashier. They eventually stopped putting me in pharmacy, then lowered my hours up front, wouldn't communicate anything, hired a  bunch of new people even though full-time workers weren't getting 30 hours a week. The managers I had were just as bad as my minimum wage retail mall job. For crying out loud, A WALMART CASHIER MAKES MORE THAN ME, a licensed pharmacy tech!! Love the pharmacy job, hate the cashier job and managerial system and employees."
bad,"A division supplying 70-80% of the prepackaged medications was being divided, but instead of informing anyone using that division, we only got messages that more and more medications would not be provided. Once the medication losses reached over 60% reduced, deeper ""investigation"" by the branch manager revealed the splitting of the division was causing a temporary reduction, lasting some months. Well, revealed to us subordinates for the first time, anyways. To make up for the loss, other departments should have picked up the difference, but no cooperation: ""We do not help that department""."
bad,"I really liked my coworkers and the customers at my location were very sweet and understanding. I definitely felt like the job kept me very busy, which I like. I learned to stick up for myself a little bit, because the management was not very understanding at all."
bad,The best way to describe working there is as follows.  Let's say your task is to hammer nails in a board.  However you are given a screwdriver to complete that task
bad,"They were fair in recognizing hardworking dedicated employees. Three years later I became discouraged and felt that I was not going to advance, so I resigned.  The moral in the company was very low."
bad,Decent company to work for if you like low pay working long hours sometimes without brakes not meeting high  Demands from the company. Over all it was a learning experience to say the least
bad,"Did everything from counting pills, inputting insurance information, and everyday customer service, to general clean up. "
bad,"Too much to do, never enough time or resources.  Guidelines seem to change weekly. You never know what is correct. Pharmacy equipment constantly breaks down and causes serious workflow interruptions."
bad,"You are responsible for EVERYTHING and not given enough time to do half of your objectives. This leads to a lot of work being put off for ""tomorrow"" and eventually being lost with other objectives from last weeks to do list. After doing this for 2 years it's become apparently clear that the stockroom and sales floor will never be where they should be and has simply become a constant game of catch-up. Personally, I need to feel proud of what I do and unfortunately, CVS does not give you the resources necessary to do the job required."
bad,Very stressful and at the mercy of both your PIC and techs.  No support from management.  Lead techs rule the pharmacy and you.  Not only do you get stress from customers but also from your techs and interns.
bad,CVS does not care about its employees and they make this clear. From the day your hired its hinted that you are a slave to the customer. The opionions and feelings of employees are invalid.
bad,The place is has the highest work rate in the Pharmacy field. With a few Techs but huge amount of work to be complete daily. Its a 24 hour facility in tampa.
bad,"Working at my current location we do not have a pharmacy manager, and the district manager that is suppose to be helping us out and running the store does nothing for us. She is very good at handing off tasks she doesn't want to help with to other people that have nothing to do with our store. She should not be a district manager and should be removed from her position."
bad,"I've worked at multiple locations for this company and unfortunately I had the pleasure of getting a manager who forced me into hating the company. The employees are constantly overworked and under appreciated by management which makes the job feel more of a chore than actually helping people. Management is so focused on ""scores"" and ""metrics"" they forget what it means to help people."
bad,"My failure to file an Initial Report was the cause of the termination. I thought that the process of submission was 72 hours upon discovery of the incident but according to the District Supervisor, it is mandatory to submit an Initial Report on the day it was discovered. I did file a report before the 72 hr. period expired & also talked to the Physician but he thought it was a reason for them to fire me."
bad,I began to lose interest with this company in 2014 because I began to notice the lack of communication skills by management. The department I worked in was a good team until I began to notice how some of the people (including management) was doing their best to get the outspoken employees terminated. The once fun and relaxed atmosphere turned into a nightmare when the company began to add too many clients
bad,"I love coming to work and talking to customers, and helping them out. if it weren't for the customers, i'd have left because they are the only ones to acknoledge my hard work and effort. employees were, for the most part, wonderful people. when properly staffed, the crew can handle any customer rush, but unfortunately that was rare."
bad,"It was an incredibly difficult place to train. There is no specific training program and so when you are on the job there is no manual and no special ""trainer"" to assist so instead I was a burden to the other employees. The people who had been there for over 10 years were not welcoming and difficult to work with."
bad,"I came here as an extern for my college course, and it was one of the most intense jobs I have ever experienced. The head pharmacist needed things done specifically and not only stressed easily, but she emanated the stress to others. The typical day included fast-paced multitasking with a huge amount of customers and call volumes daily. Mostly understaffed, expecting one to two technicians to do the work of eight. The hardest part was working multiple stations at the same time, and definitely time-management. The only thing enjoyable about this job was that you are busy enough that time passes by quickly."
bad,The job was slow and days dragged. Management sucks don't take advice from employees and quick to point fingers when things were bad. Salary was horrible worked there for 9-10 years and got 3 bucks in raises during that time.
bad,"I worked third shift and had to run claims, I was left alone on most nights in an empty building with no security. The claim amounts i processed were never right and were what i was being judged on for performance. The manager I had did the least amount possible to pass as a manager."
bad,its good organization to work for. i worked there for almost 6 months and everyone was friendly and a good place to work for. i would recommmend this organization to a friend
bad,"The people that you work with are great, but the company does not have any regard for their staff. It is like a puppy mill...they churn people in and work them to death until they quit, and then churn in the next group of people. "
bad,"Unfair pay as well as being understaffed. This company is not loyal to its employees, even the pharmacists are treated poorly. I would never reccomend this company."
bad,"I tried everything I could to advance there. I was a warrior worker, however they had their favorites.  Supervisors walking around with walkies talkies like running a prison camp.  The employees were not valued or respected.  I saw people crying and being put under severe stress.  I got tired of being the abuse after 4 long years of tortured, I got the courage to leave."
bad,Working in the pharmacy at CVS was very stressful. The expectations are unrealistic. They add more work and less time for the store hours. I'm grateful for the opportunity but I wouldn't make a career out of working for this company. Pharmacy Technician is a dead end job with no room for advancement.
bad,"If  you  are  new  to  the pharmacy  field,  this  is  a  place  to  start  for  experience.  After  adequate  knowledge  is  gained,  find  another  job!"
bad,My main job was cashier. This really is not a great place to work if you're looking for a company to grow with. The management at my time of employment was awful. I was treated like I could never learn anything else.
bad,Needs better management in the pharmacy department  other wise the cafeteria was great and they provide nice size desk with drawers so you can have a spacious and comfortable work area work area.
bad,"Employees are subject to unhealthily doses of daily stress, due to low staffing budgets, poor upper management techniques and unrealistic expectations of lower level employees with minimal/hindered access to basic company resources required to achieved desired results. All this results in high employee turnover and re-training issues."
bad,"Everyone going to Pharmacy school for retail should work here to learn the reality of what they are signing up for."
bad,"I loved working at the front of the store, but pharmacy is a completely different story. The managers are strict, there's a lot of learning, and it's often extremely busy-to the point where there isn't much help if needed. If going into a medical career, this would be a good start. But for me, it's too much. Had some of the worst customers I've ever encountered in my entire working career."
bad,"crazy place to work, never want to work at a place like that agian, no compasion towards employees, very bad attitudes, managers are selfish all for themselves"
bad,Very bureaucratic and rigidly controlled company policies. Patient interaction remained minimal and the goals and sales targets were the primary objectives. Patient care was always secondary. Lunch breaks were short and not scheduled. The conditions deteriorated once the acquisition of Eckerd was done.
bad,"Cvs bought omnicare in 2016, it is 1st experience with long term care. They think you can run it like a retail pharmacy. You can not! Comport different needs."
bad,Many conflicting messages and directives from local and corporate management groups. There is a lack of clear objectives and virtually no involvement channels for employees to discuss ideas for department growth.
bad,i prefer not to elaborate but it isn't what I expected or was told. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to make a difference and provide the best service to our patients.
bad,They played me on my yearly review. They promised a raise after my training period and the raise was barely over minimum wage with 20 hours. Only over 20 hours when someone takes off. I need full time with benefits. Too much stress with monthly modules and daily soliciting of flu shots and time restraints on processing prescriptions. A lot a of running & working with a skelton team daily processing scripts at 1300 -1400 weekly.
bad,"For the time I was there, I had three managers. It's was an experience. I think they should check what managers does in their stores especially with schedule."
bad,I started when it was Savons and it was much better than CVS. As soon it turned to CVS it started to get stressful. They expect you to work more than you have to for a minimum pay. You do what you have to and meed expectation but some how always something missing. Everyone that works there feel stress and don't like working their but we all need a job. They don't pay you fair for what you do. They tell you something and never actually do it.
bad,"Very busy and high pace work, learned different areas of the plant and how they function, opportunities to advance, management was ok but not willing to work with you on certain situations"
bad,"Management is key to a fully functioning pharmacy. While it is getting better, there are still a lot of things that go on that shouldn't. Thus, people get stressed out and overwhelmed very easily in this setting because there's no sense of direction or stability in procedures."
bad,"typical work day its pretty slow . you had to replenish most of the day . I learned about stock and inventory, checking for promotions which was good. the hardest about the job was you really have to do your research on all the products and medications. The most enjoyable part helping customers."
bad,This company is only worried about number and nothing else. They do not understand that we can not make numbers when some calls can take 20 mins at a time. And also if you don't use the bathroom often this is a job for you. You only get 6 mins a day to use the restroom.
bad,Almost every manager i had was on a power trip. They were always very disrespectful; making inappropriate and unprofessional comments all the time. I even had an issue with s**ual harassment that corporate just brushed off and transferred me to another store where i was treated very unfairly because of the stigma.
bad,"Every week more items are added to your plate as a pharmacy manager, and it becomes increasingly difficult to take care of your patients. CVS only cares about the dollar, not the patient, and it becomes clearer and clearer every week."
bad,"Management is a huge issue,  too much micromanaging and favoritism. If you weren't in with the boss you were over looked and treated like garbage. Without being a clique or being the managers favorite people acted like If you were sick or took a vacation that you were faking it or a lazy worker. Everyone was very two faced and I would come into work everyday worried that they were letting more people go and I could be next and there was a new rule they would make up everyday.  You could barely breathe without being confronted that you were basically breathing incorrectly. It's really a petty and stressful enviornment. There were a few good employees that made going to work worth it but too many cons."
bad,This company has no balance or organization to keep things going. They do not care about their employees. Certainly not paid enough to deal with being treated like you are not good enough.
bad,"Don't do it! Long hours with no home life. Management lies about volume and just keeps pushing.  Never know work hours from day to day. You are literally on your feet for 11.5 hrs of a 12 hr shift. Hot, dirt and very under staffed at Chemung DC. Ppl walk out from being pushed.  And 50% of the work you are doing is for other warehouses.  Think long and hard before applying. Pay isn't the best."
bad,this job was a job that paid bery well and gave you a lot of hours but it is not the best place to work they don't respect their employees all they care about is making sure the work for that day gets done and then some.
bad,Get paid to sell your soul.  Basically no job training they throw you in there and when you make a mistake because you haven't been trained how to do the job they fire you.  Cvs stands for suck it
bad,"Having a great team and partner makes this job worth it. For the most part, you're always understaffed. Metrics are the focus. It is very difficult to show patients attention, without the pharmacy getting behind. The hardest part of this job is appeasing the management. The best part of the job is knowing that you are making a difference in a patient's life."
bad,Company continues to milk employees of spirit by cutti g hours on a regular basis to spend least amount to keep rx open. Rphs are expected to continue to take care of customers with very little support personnel
bad,"I was employed with CVS as a Supervisor for almost 3 years and in that time I had 3 managers, and every supervisor who was employed when I started had quit because of management and the way they were being treated. I had numerous meal penalties (almost one every day) because of lack of coverage, and the next supervisor would always come to work late or have changed their schedule without notifying anyone. This was also something the manager did which not only was difficult because I have a life outside of work and because I was unable to complete tasks because of lack of coverage."
bad,"Maybe its the location, but there is a lot of stress when it comes to this job. Very fast pace, but requires a lot of patience. They do strive to do whats best for the customer though, and the pharmacist are very knowledgeable."
bad,"the hours I worked were accommodating fast pace customer service center, the location was sometimes hard for me to get to once my car broke down, compensation not that great"
bad,"Not your best retail pharmacy environment, staffing is never meets demand, there is really no time to train and learn the correct way to do things,  technicians are not as qualified as they should be."
bad,"Your customers determine whether you get to keep this job. CVS sends randoms surveys to their emails and they rate us based on genuine CARE. There is a minimum target, I believe our store's minimum target was 78 (customer surveys) and It must be met. Very stressful to work there."
bad,"CVS demands you buy into them but as soon as they feel you are useless they will discard you. do they consider the weekends you put in full shifts to keep up with the demand of the job, No. the extra hours you work daily to keep up with the lack of manning, No. work life balance is a Joke. under paid and over work. the dangle the word promotion in your face to push you to be even more productive but never give it. CVS favorite phrase, your on the radar. what a joke"
bad,"The customers are not the worst there honestly, it is the company overall, management and some employees. The uniforms aren't that bad now, i prefer that than bringing my own clothes. Most employees don't actually care about their patients"
bad,Very poor management and lack of professionalism.  Management had little to know customer service or training experience and placed very high demands on employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and meeting new people.
bad,"The pharmacists are great, benefits not too bad. Very understaffed. Pay not at all competitive. When I bring up concerns or issues to management, including patient safety, nothing is done to resolve it."
bad,Omnicare was a call center environment that was stressful in many ways. Lead techs weren't as helpful as they could be and management could've been beter.
bad,CVS is a company that uses its employees and management for profit only and shows no care or concern for individuals except as they affect the bottom line.  Not a caring nurturing organization.
bad,"Save your self the time, avoid it. Poor managers who constantly are over turned and shuffled around bc lack of talent. Can not keep a director to save their lives. Managers who goof off and change their tires on company time are rewarded and promoted with cupcakes.  OT is selected for the ppl the like. Buy some chap stick, turn you brain off bc it's made clear you are not hired to think and kiss some butt. You'll be fine."
bad,The company seems to favor less educated and the least reliable candidates to advance.  A typical day at work is logging into the phone system and taking numerous calls to answer pharmaceutical benefit questions and order placement. Requirements are to educate the member and explain their benefits while offering products within their plan package.
bad,"Job Culture is poor, Everyone has low work morale, management sucks especially corporate. The customers are the worst. They are always cutting hours and then expect you to pick up random last minute shifts. Who can work pt or ft on 13- 30 hrs as if you will ever even reach 30."
bad,"A typical day at work (as any job) it is exhausting, out of control."
bad,"In hospitals all day trying to see Case Managers who are usually closed off.  Many end of the day discharges and day before holidays working hard."
bad,"I worked in the call center in Monroeville PA for a year. The entire time it was beyond stressful due to being understaffed constantly and the lack of information being passed along in a correct and timely manner. They thought they can teach people by email, but forget everyone is being spammed all day between Skype and email, ontop of the job itself, that email checking doesn't and can't happen. 50 new emails a day where 49 are of employees complaining they can't get time off (you have to request 1 month in advance if and only if 5 people don't have that day off already, even though the call center has over 150 employees in that department). "
bad,Minimum quality of life while working for this company.  Excessive hours required by their managers.  Low motivation through out the company to assist in a quality of life for their employees.
bad,"A typical day at work is spent on the phones answering phones and dealing with some rude people. I learned that i really dont like to talk, and that training is self taught, after 4 weeks training."
bad,Awful management teams here and unrealistic expectations for employees at the retail level. Management forgets what working at the retail level is like.
bad,"During the time I worked at CVS. Management was horrific. Scheduling preferences were not respected, and it was ignored. My manager harassed me to show up to work while sick, and out of town. Even though I requested the time off from weeks ahead. We were not allowed lunch. It honestly comes down to management. If your pharmacy manager is good the job can be enjoyable. If not, you struggle arguing with someone who can't figure out the schedule or respect people. My manager would call my co workers during funerals!!! Even though he was previously informed. He couldn't get the job right. I left as soon as I could. Don't recommend it unless the manger is experienced and fair."
bad,company doesnt care about the people who are there. If you are lucky the people you work with are cool but the company treats its employees bad
bad,work  like a slave and hustle hours from other stores to try to make ends meet. Good training grounds for a beginner . They should pay more and stop being greedy
bad,very busy rx dept with not enough  help...they use a bogus schedule demand equation that doesnt work.... patient care and service is compromised ... they expect you to attend business meetings on your day off and not pay you... they have no feelings for you as an individual ... they only care about how fast you can work and how many rx's you can fill
bad,Unorganized and racist not really a easy company to grow in. work life balance is non existent which causes other personal issues and stresses. Not easy on your body at all.
bad,"Limited opportunity for advancement and poor compensation and benefits. "
bad,"i would like to work at a place where there is always room for growth, improvement and fun"
bad,"As a data entry clerk at CVS in their pre-authorizatiom department, this was the worst job ever!  You WILL BE micro-managed! Before you go to the bathroom, you have to code out of your computer (understandable) AND your phone (we're not even on the phones)!! You only get a 30 minute lunch, they're not upfront with how much or even IF the pay rate will increase if you make permanent and last but not least, with a job this stressful, you'd think the dress code would be more laid back.....NOT! Jeans are only allowed on Friday....ALL FOR A WHOPPING 12.00 PER HOUR! "
bad,"I would not recommend CVS as a place to work.  Store managers get bonuses based on how hard the employees work, not how hard the manager themselves work.  Some store managers think the best way to manage a store is to delegate all of the work to other people so they do not have to work as much.  The Union is the best and worst part of working for CVS.  People use the Union to get their way in unfair situations to all parties.  At the same time, the Union makes sure that employees receive their raises accordingly."
bad,"Very busy, not enough staff, low pay. This was an emergency job. We also had a drive thru, they could do better in treating their technicians right and providing better customer service for all."
bad,"typical day was dealing with customers, there was no flexibilty.  co- workers was great and ill say the hardest part of the job was dealing with the store manager who didnt care for his employees"
bad,Very stressful atmosphere. CVS makes customers angry. If you want to learn about the different medications everyone gets annoyed with you. Management in the pharmacy is more concerned about quantity than quality.
bad,"Count & Stock various medications"
bad,This is a typical big-box retail store.  The company does not hide the fact they focus on metrics.  Lack of technician support staff.  Lack of pharmacist support.  Management is not support.
bad,CVS Health needs improvement on their training of new hires as well as employee retention efforts.  They set unrealistic expectations of their new hires and fail to offer assistance with continuous improvement training.
bad,"I had a terrible manager so I am sure that other people have a better experience working at CVS, but mine was bad the entire time there because of the store manager."
bad,"Its a hit or miss with this company I am assuming. This specific district showed a lot of favoritism and had ""clicks"". Not Professional."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of opening my workload and trying to bill 15 different contracted and non-contracted insurances."
bad,I have nothing to record about this company. My opinions are not a fair assessment of the company and its work environment.
bad,"Excellent way into the customer service world, Customers are usually nice and pleasant and the work is fairly straightforward."
bad,"Love helping the people in RX, great feeling when filling their prescriptions and helping with their insurance.  Co-workers are great, most Store Managers are wonderful, one of the hardest jobs I have had, if you are not a hard worker this place is not for you."
bad,hated it. worst job i've ever had. quit after a month because it was so terrible. don't get involved at all. you adjust to the hours rather than the hours adjusting to you
bad,The atmosphere is ok the people you work with are nice. Always short staffed and customers are rude. The pharmacy manger is easy to get along with along the with the other pharmacists. The main problem is being yelled at by certain customers.
bad,"The company makes it difficult to conduct business internally due to red tape, politics and short term decisions to please shareholders."
bad,"terrible management, preferential treatment, horrible morale, stressful work conditions"
bad,"This place with a different type of management and real supervision"
bad,A typical day at work would mainly consist of processing transactions and data entry everyday would be different but only if I would take initiative to do so.
bad,Worked here over 10yrs. Without reasons told to us they just closed us down( for the sake of business)...moved our division(CIC) to Chicago. Over 60 out of work. Now they are moving the downtown division giving over 200 the boot.. Management /supervisors gave poor instructions & poor training only focus on negative.  Very rare positive feed back.  No bonus's or any special compensations. Company does Not care for employees only $$$...
bad,"While I think that CVS is an excellent starting point for someone who has never had a job before (like me when I worked there) it's really the least rewarding job I can think of. None of the customers respect you or think you're capable of doing anything right, the management is really oblivious, and you're definitely just treated like a number in the system. I can't tell you how many times I thought of quitting before I finally did. I had cried at work (in private) multiple times because customers would relentlessly attack me for small mistakes, and while it's easy to say I should have just sucked it up, it's really hard to maintain a self esteem when every day it's the same thing. Sometimes it just breaks you! "
bad,"My time at CVS would've been much better had the management team actually managed the store. The manager, who no longer works at this location, was very nice and welcoming when I first started there. By the time I left, he was acting like he could care less about the store. Issues and conflicts were being ignored until they finally boiled over into a blowout. I never bothered to complain or bring forward any issue I had simply because I knew he wouldn't do anything about it. Or he'd lie about not saying something and then backtrack when confronted with the truth. The assistant manager is the primary reason for my disdain. This woman was completely unprofessional towards customers and employees, making both cry. She instigated most of the problems in the store. Whenever a customer needed help, she acted as if it were a huge inconvenience to her. She would take her time to answer you when you called for her. Most times I would be in the store alone because she would be outside on a smoke break, which would last up to an hour on most nights. And she would never even tell me when she was going out. She sits outside talking to random people or texting on her phone all night. She would leave the store while I was on lunch break, without telling me and without locking it up. She would cut side deals with certain customer and let them use extremely expired coupons. She would get into screaming matches with customers. The general reaction to every negative thing was to push it under the rug. We had to steer customers from calling the corporate line for complaints by giving them the district"
bad,"When i first started at Omnicare my job was fun, I loved my co-workers. My boss was actually compassionate and caring. But in the last year my schedule has changed over 6 times, I'm constantly being woken up during the day and asked to come in early but yet later in the week I'm basically scolded for having overtime. They just have no idea how to run the place but when you have a GM and supervisor who have no clue about pharmacy who are not pharmacist or pharmacy techs you will have that."
bad,"Company was bought out back in February 2014 by CVS Caremark.  Since then, the organization has gone through several changes within that next year, complicating the end process.  It holds a high standard with great home infusion services, and help when it is needed."
bad,"A typical day for me would entail, me contacting my site hospitals, gathering my patient information, verifying insurance, obtaining authorizations, contacting patients regarding there benefits, explaining all Medicare and Medicaid benefits as well as commercial benefits to patients. Maintaining a detailed calendar of deliveries and patients start of care, creating all Medicare orders, documenting all activity in detail..collecting all copays over the phone. Hardest part of the job is having no lead time to handle patients being discharged from the facility on the same day."
bad,Not employee friendly - lack of respect - turn around of employees and supervisors is extremely high. Would not recommend to fellow job seekers.
bad,"CVS is a good company to work for they just don't pay enough."
bad,"Stressful environment and no work/life balance. 24/7 job at IT with constant pressure at work. Too much workload."
bad,Co-workers are great. Management is very poor. Technicians and pharmacists are overworked and treated like garbage. Cvs only cares about the quantity of rx's it fills and how fast we can do it with a minimal amount of staff.  Management does not recognize how hard we work and only focus on the negative.
bad,The company overall is a solid company. The Management culture is very caustic. There is no way to determine how long the work day will be until orders come over the network. The Operation Manager is married to an hourly employee and this creates a perception of conflict. There is very little diversity here and every Manager of color has been let go for whatever reason. Routinely 10-12 hour days and the pay is much lower than industries of the same kind in the area.
bad,Needs better Pharmacy Managers with better attitudes and needs to have better employee involvement. Doesn't know how to manage production well.
bad,"My first experience in a pharmacy learning how to develop customer service, manage time filling orders and understanding the concept of the importance to always be flexible."
bad,"My days in CVS involved Stocking, cleaning and assisting customers , also dealing with some rude coworkers who were unpleasant to work with."
bad,"Working on the infusion side of CVS is exciting. It's a complex population and very fast paced and fulfilling. The bad part is that the business end is poorly run. Management makes poor decisions and corporate is so far removed, they have no idea what actually goes on from a branch level."
bad,"This is an organization with PMO paralysis.  They are so focused on controlling and monitoring that they are completely unable to innovate."
bad,"I just started in August and I am already looking for a new job, that should basically say it all."
bad,"Assign work stations and then I print, separate labels, pull medications, pack, and then scan them. Pull compound ingredients for a pharmacist to check and then mix compounds. "
bad,"I had no pharmacy experience prior to working for CVS Health. I did learn a lot on the job, and made some great friends with my co-workers in the process."
bad,"CVS Caremark is mainly understaffed and is run by managers who only think about more production, not one concern for the employee. They have no clue what is going on in the facility. Leads and Admins and Supervisors walk around all day playing pocket pool. The pay is terrible for the amount the business makes. Would not recommend this job for anybody. It is a FACTORY not a pharmacy."
bad,"I love my co workers, we make a great team! It's just too bad that CVS and it's pharmacy manager do not acknowledge a job well done. Getting them to pay you for any time which is owed to you, such as vacation is a nightmare.  I did enjoy meeting different people and being able to assist them, and make them feel better. our location is a very busy one! so, the most difficult part of the job in my opinion would be one person doing the job of 3! this would cause impatient customers to start being rude, which is never good."
bad,its a very stressful job they treat you nothing like an employee they treat you like a slave with no breaks and no lunches even when you work an 8 hour shift or longer. Customers treat you like your not a person and nothing is organized
bad,This job felt like I was a person to fill a chair and nobody cared one thing about me or the people calling in for that matter.
bad,"I've worked there, since july,2012 and it's been a very, unhappy place to work at...I've been written, for breaking policies. When other people have not... Been written up for breaking the same policies....I've not been give my annual revue, from back in july....It's avery bi-est place to work for. The girls get the day shift, while the guys work nights., The head lead pharmacy technician schedules her self off every weekend. While everybody else works weekends. Management is very un-professional..."
bad,"If you want to be overworked ad underpaid then this is the job for you! Worked with rude pharmacists and techs. Always understaffed, and customers get upset about this, and yell at us techs. Sometimes techs get 1 day off because so understaffed!"
bad,"-interact with the customers, work the register,stock the shelves, manage a crew to perform different task."
bad,"Taking inbound calls from members setting up delivery of their meds thru mail order.  I worked for one of the many clients. Horrible people. "
bad,"*  Punch in, gather your orders and get to work."
bad,"I liked that you are'nt just a cashier at this job, they definitely keep you busy with different store tasks, however they do not provide the breaks that are posted as a requirement for CVS employees, when you do ask for a break you are treated like you are not a hard worker because you want a break, everyone I worked with were very hard workers at a very busy store however it will take you years to make 9.00 an hour working here. The store management was great with customers and running the store in general but had a tendency to be rude and condescending to its hard working employees."
bad,"I was a contract employee there for a few months, but when the contract ended almost every employee was laid off. They tell you that you did a great job, but don't provide explanation as to why you didn't get full time position. Also, cut-throat work environment, very few people would help you and management would fire people for almost nothing."
bad,"Good job security, as you can work there as long as you want, assuming you don't care about being underpaid."
bad,"Stay in the red most of the day due to being understaffed. I learned that working for a retail chain pharmacy is not ideal to make a decent salary, and to be paid under 10 dollars an hour is simply not fair compensation when compared to responsibility of the job and work load."
bad,Supervisors are not knowledgeable or professional. Unorganized place to work. Some Assignments were against CMS guidelines.
bad,"I began with CVS/Pharmacy in '09 as a pharmacy service associate and completed training to become a tech. The first few years, until the changing of the CEO, were enjoyable - I did not mind going in to work. Customers were happy and employees were happy, but after multiple hour cuts across the board and increased job requirements things became extremely stressful. Also, they froze pay raises and refused to make ANYONE full time even after all full time staff quit, except for 1 tech. Therefore, you can forget benefits. Don't expect to move up..."
bad,There was only one upside to this job and that was pay. The work was very divided and uneven between employes. I only worked there two months then was let go without notices after my hours were cut back do to school. If you are a student or have any other obligations do not work for this company.
bad,"Typical day is laden with the responsibility of overseeing staff, ensuring that tasks are completed on time, and full immersion in work-flow to ensure that the pharmacy does not ""fall apart"" and customers are satisfied.  I learned that multitasking and time management are essential to completing tasks on time, both my tasks and those that staff fail to complete.  Front Store management is great as reflected by improvement in the Front Store scores.  Pharmacy continues to struggle score-wise as pharmacy management is sub-par and often counter productive and personnel seems to lack motivation to succeed.  The hardest part of my job is motivating my team to work as hard as I do, regardless of the pay we receive.   For a fast paced pharmacy, 90% of the staff moves at a snail's pace and customers notice this.  When I push my staff to move faster or work harder, I am met with excuses that are backed by the Pharmacist in Charge.  This tends to make my job more stressful than it should be because I then have to put in 150% effort to pick up where everyone leaves off.  The most enjoyable part of my job is surpassing my own expectations of my performance daily, as I push myself to get more done in less time, with few or no mistakes."
bad,"A typical day includes scanning in cardinal drugs, printing labels, pulling drugs, counting prescriptions, helping customers find products, finding better prices on medicines for customers, filling out workstation board for others to follow, customer service, ordering drugs, filing hard copies, and making sure all chores are done for the day. The hardest part of my job is trying to make sure everyone is doing their part so that one person does not get stuck doing so much. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers."
bad,"Typically a night at work for me is fast moving, we have over 2500 customers who come through CVS monthly.  I don't feel like there really is a hard part of my job, it's pretty simple to pick up on and to carry out the tasks asked of me.  I enjoy talking with the customers and interacting with them the most.  Being the front line and the first person they have contact with in the store it's nice to be able to make their experience a great one."
bad,"I, in one year, traveled to 7 different store assisting in set up and training issues.  I ran 3 of the stores with no other manager.  After new DM came in myself and 25 out of 27 managers where terminated for various performance reasons."
bad,Not really a great place to work. Company is becoming to big to care about their employees and customers.
bad,This is a company where you can start your career in retail.  However since it is such a large company it can be difficult for an employee to advance.
bad,"Negatives: Very low raises, never enough staff to help customers, 9hr work days, ignorant customers, addict customers, no room for advancement, corporate doesn't care about employees, disgruntled-overworked-underpaid employees (start off 9hrly) other pharmacies may give 12 or more. It's not a very good work environment.  If you really are desperate for a job then apply. You will be hired because employees are always leaving. Don't expect full time benefits but expect full time hours. You will be worked. You'll will even be harassed to work on your days off. CVS does not care and HR is a complete joke.  You have no rights as an employee. It's all about customer service.  They bend over for customers. Benefits: Google it. Thatll blow your mind. Tons of reviews online about that atrocity.  Hope this helps."
bad,"Great company to work for, learned a lot had fun! I would encourage any high school student to work there"
bad,"If you work in pharmacy...beware:"
bad,Overworked from upper management. They cut your employees hours to give out so you work with usually just one other person. Working with employees and customers is fun and rewarding. Great training programs.
bad,A typical day at work is always different learn to dispense medication order entry and answering phone and counseling patients with medical needs or doctor say to. Also my co-workers were always there for me when I needed a hand. But management was really poor there can't really explain. The most part I enjoy the most was seeing my regular customer.
bad,"When the government says that you're doing bad, you know you're in trouble.  Their software development is atrocious."
bad,"A typical day at work begins at 8am when I log onto computers and start to fill the new prescriptions and rectify the rejects in the queue. I take care of customers and make doctor calls and start production of prescriptions until my techs show up at 9am. I delegate the production and data entry duties to the techs and check in the outside vender order and verify prescriptions. "
bad,Great company but they lack discipline and order. Unjust reasons for consequences and management can seriously use some work.
bad,"I fill med orders, help get delivery ready, and everything else that has to be done at work."
bad,"The recent merger of a 4-star Medicare Part D plan rating with a 2-star Medicare part D plan that was under sanctions at the time of the merger (in addition to the 4-star plan defering it's policies & procedures to that of the 2-star plan), seemed to doom what was once a GREAT company. Through all of this, co-workers really shine by staying outstandingly supportive of one another. A true family."
bad,No comments on this very large organization who supports the VP only and not the managers that try to achieve their unattainable goals for sub-ordinates.
bad,"Typically most customers are repeat customers,  some good, some not so good.  Due to the location of this store, some of the clientele could make for a good episode of Law & Order. Enjoyed the associates I worked with."
bad,this job is not difficult however it is very stressfull. there is no communication between managers. they advise that there are oppotunities for growth but nothing ever comes to fruition. this company is very unprofessional and does not care about their employees.
bad,"A typical day in the pharmacy requires a cooperative effort between the Tech, Pharmacist and co-workers in order to ensure quality and satisfaction to our customers. Having work for CVS for the past 6 years, I have learned that when you approach the customers with the right attitude and have a little patience they can be the brightest part of your day."
bad,"A typical day was I clocked in on the computer and got yelled at by my manager for not clocking in fifteen minutes early... even though I did clock in 5 minutes earlier.  Then my managers scared off customers while I brought more in because of my customer service.  A lot of people liked me, but the management and my co-workers didn't seem to really care.  "
bad,"If you're just starting out in the field of pharmacy tech, it's a good place to start, but you'll find yourself wanting something else soon after.  Breaks are very limited, and you may not get one your entire shift.  CVS as a company expresses good culture/values, but at a store level, it is rarely followed through.  Customer service is a very difficult industry and working at CVS certainly proves this.  You will have more bad moments than good, but the good ones will help you through the day because customers can also be rewarding."
bad,"No room for advancement unless you're a manager. Management is ineffective and backwards. Overtime is excessive, and one cannot plan anything, because time at work is always indefinite."
bad,"management was terrible, did not care about employees, did not handle hostile work environment, worked 12+ hour long shifts with an occasional 30 min lunch and no breaks"
bad,"I made an HR ethics complaint regarding a shft manager who was violating store policies. The district manger came to my store pulled me outside the store and told me that I shoudn't have attempted to contact the area manager. The store manger, and the shift manager I complained about have a questionable personal relationship. The store manager has a family member who works at the store, who is very nice, but very lazy. Cycle counts, price changes are rarely done. Their work fall backs on customer service who are written up if they don't do their mangers work left behind. When I pursued my complaint with HR, I was told I was just a cashier and that my store manager has the discretion to do what he wants. I was told I didn't have to worry about retaliation, but the store manager never listens to what I say and is now watching every thing I do on the camera to write me up while other employees get away with talking on their phone, listening to music, being late and doing drugs. The store manger, district manger and Loss Prevention have no integrity. It's unfair working conditions!"
bad,"If you care enough to sincerely help someone, you get in trouble for doing what isn't required. If you're too business-like and efficient you get in trouble for not engaging with customer on a more personal level."
bad,"The company only cares about the bottom dollar. Yes there is free coffee, but it isn't enough. People are not valued. Promotions are given to those who are closest to management. Not necessarily qualified. Management skills are lacking & your voice will not be heard."
bad,"Corporate will continue to cut hours, and expect more and more of their employees, until the employees are ready to have nervous breakdowns or snap. It's ridiculous and disgusting. We get yelled at by customers for having long lines and wait times. In store management can be great, but the higher ups don't care about anything but making money."
bad,"The employees are generally very good dedicated people (with the exception of the one's who report to the General Manner). Steer clear of HR, she is a waste of time, if she comes to the building. 100% lack of business ethics, HIPAA Violations (covered up by General Manager). People in positions of authority who have no idea what is going on. Certain departments get cakewalk schedules even though the facility is opened 24/7. NO CHANCE FOR PROMOTION because the General Manager is so insecure someone will do better than him. Lot's of back stabbing....no measuring of productivity or accuracy because when they do, it is determined the ""people they don't like"" are actually the best employees and it sheds a bad light on the ones the General Manager is protecting. The facilities manager will be nice to your face, then sit in his office and spy using the security system. Inventory manager was caught illegally returning medication to bottles, and someone else was fired for it...covered up again by General Manager. General Manager refuses to comply with state or federal laws and lies about it..."
bad,"At first, the company was great. Free thinking and creativity was encouraged. But as it got larger, and a new president took over, it became more about pleasing shareholders and ""do what we say"". If you like simply following direction with no queations asked, by all means work here. If you want to be creative and drive sales through innovative ideas and meaningfuk conversation and feedback with your boss...look elsewhere. Also, even though FS managers dont have direct control over their pharmacy, they are held accountable for it. How do you fix something you cannot directly control?"
bad,No analytical thinking or creativity required. The company is run for its investors and not for the benefit of the customer. Everyone who works there seems to be miserable.
bad,I was treated as a number in a computer and not as a human being. In the nearly two years I worked their I was shuffeled from store to store encountering unqualified people in management posistions at every level. Promotions are based on who you know and not what you know. The climate is stale and unfriendly. Skip CVS unless you are a young person still living at home. Not a job for an adult.
bad,I had good co-workers other then that not the company for me.
bad,No team work.
bad,Would be a great company ran by the right people. The warden walks around making sure the slaves are breathing
bad,"I was with this company for far too long... The department I worked for was a mix of people with ranging education and qualifications, some very offensive and rude. My direct manager would make derogatory comments on a regular basis... I only stayed because I was under contract."
bad,"All work no play, but lots of money and no respect for employee's family life."
bad, Dealt directly with customers either by telephone or face to face.
bad,"Not a horrible place to work, but not a great place to work either."
bad,Very stressful place to work. company does not care about it's employees. Managers are not competent. Production is more important than doing a decent job. Company is micromanaged to death. The morale is the worst I have ever seen. Managers treat you like a two year old and won't allow you to be independent.
bad,"Unfortunately with CVS "
bad,"I worked very hard and got nowhere after 3 years, management changed and they seemed to favor certain people over others, need to watch your back everyday. Schedule was not even or fair, working extra went unnoticed, never got a raise the whole 3 years i was there."
bad,The company keeps cutting hours so it is impossible to give customer service & deter theft. Yet they EXPECT high customer service scores. Self checkouts  also prevent us from giving customer service & they are scheduled to go in every store. There are not enough hours to do all the tasks & wait on customers & have good scores doing it.
bad,CVS is an okay company to work for if you really need a job & great enough to gain experience. Not enough compensation for all the hard work done though.
bad,"Constant rotation of managers resulting in previous agreements null and void. Hectic work style, corporate cutting more and more hours while asking techs and pharmacists to do more tasks is same time frame."
bad,I have been there for two years. One of the top pickers. After hiring new employees management started to Target the employees that have been there for a long time in trying to rid of them.
bad,Management varies with the store you are placed at. Focus is consistently  on outcomes but without being provided with adequate resources to complete tasks
bad,"Company likes to brag about never having layoffs. But, what they fail to mention is that the revolving door spins so fast, the turnover rate is too high to ever maintain a fully staffed facility."
bad,"It's a job. If you just need employment history, CVS will be just that. It's hard to get time off if you're low in seniority. I strongly dislike that work hours change DAILY, start times and end times are NEVER consistent. Seems like whoever does their volume projections needs to be re-trained."
bad,"This company values its metrics, not employees. It wasn’t always how it is now. The company was tolerable once upon a time. But over time, humility has gone out the door. Pure micromanagement."
bad,"I started out in one pharmacy and transferred to another pharmacy in the company that was in the Northern part of the state. The best part of the job were the very sweet patients that were kind and understood and were very patient, the worst part of the job was the patients that were very nasty and screamed and yelled at you. I went from a place where I was filling prescriptions just about the whole time to a place where I basically just ran the cash register all of the time-wasting what skills and experience I had to bring to the table. I have a Medical Assistant degree and the reason I was a pharmacy technician is that it was the closet thing to medical I could find. I am back in school again for nursing so hopefully, I can find something better!!"
bad,"Good job for college students, always learning something new everyday, management is good,not enough key holders,only two people working up front at all times"
bad,"The work can be stressful as HIPAA and Medicare are very stringent with their requirements. Management is never on the floor, so most of your help will come from more experienced representatives. Every call is recorded so management does listen to phone calls and you are evaluated monthly. They will upskill you and provide additional training, almost always virtually. You do not get rewarded financially for all those new skills(responsibilities). Breaks are recorded to the second. Most of the people are extremely friendly and willing to help. Management is nice but not effective at all They do not interact with their people unless required."
bad,"Personally, I love my job. However, CVS is cutting back on hours and help way too much. Not only is it not going to be sustainable, it is producing hostile work environments. Employees are overworked and underpaid."
bad,Not a whole lot of room for growth. So many training courses to complete before they think you deserve anything. & when it’s earned they take forever to compensate
bad,"no respect for employees, service events for everything. all about what you did bad and no praise for what you do good. hours I was told were early morning and ended up with 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. which is horrible no time for my volunteer work. hard to get Dr. appointments. just awful! they are all about themselves! I am stuck with it in order to pay my bills!"
bad,Company is good if you like that sort of thing. I personally don't like the way it is ran. In order to get full time benefits you have to average out to 30 hours a week for a year. They don't allow you to do that so they can save money for their million dollar company.
bad,"On paper, this is a great job. Manage a store in every aspect from building and developing a team to merchandising and utilizing P&L statements to focus on areas of improvement to better your business. Corporate handcuffs its store managers by keeping its payroll so thin, it's impossible to complete the litany of tasks that they require. There are certain stores, areas and exceptions to the rule, but the majority of store managers that work for this company often work 5-6 days a week and 50-60 hours a week while getting paid for the 45 salaried hours. The corporate literature will tout how much they care about their employees and a good work/life balance but the payroll is shaved so thin in every store that there is never more than a cashier and the manager on duty on the clock at any given time, making the MoD responsible for 10-11 man hours worth of work to accomplish in 7-8 hours. The pay is good for the position, so on paper it looks like a sweet gig...but the reality is that you will work well above the 45 hours a week salaried employees are expected to work (everything over 45 hours is free labor), your payroll is so thin you won't have a base staff to pull from should someone call out sick, and don't even think about being sick or needing time off - ever, because it's next to impossible to cover your absence wether it be due to a vacation, family emergency, illness, etc."
bad,"it started out fine.  as time went on, it felt like everything we were told by management was a lie - ask 2 managers the same question and you'll get two different answers."
bad,Work was professional and productive as always great employees and supervisor understanding employees great team work and team player the work was. Light and easy to do and understand the concept of pharmacy technician being able to enter prescription into the system was fearly easy to do taking inbound calls and making outbound calls was a way of being professional in doing our jobs
bad,"Got scheduled for days I previously stated I would be unable to work due to school, only 3 unpaid days off within a 90 day period. Unfair scheduling and requests for more hours were completely ignored, in fact the opposite was done. 5.5 hours a week is not sustainable for the cost of living in Maryland."
bad,It is hard being a pharmacist at CVS these days. I don't think they provide enough technician support to do our job well. The long hour work with little breaks make it hard to stay motivated.
bad,You do not want to work in eligibility. The job is stressful and they over work you. They pile more and more work on top you. They will call you and text in the middle of the night and also expect you to log on at anytime. You are required to take laptops home. Most people do not last 2 years. They are always hiring for this role due to high turnover rate.
bad,Treats their customers with quality service but NOT their employees at all. They treat employees like factory workers. Only allowed to break not even for the bathroom sometimes.
bad,"long hours"
bad,"Short staffed, inconsistent hours, micromanagement in corporate, requires more in completing task with not appropriate resources and time to complete tasks in a timely manner."
bad,"CVS is the devil incarnate. Pharmacy DMs do not care about you, the pharmacy technician working in the trenches so that they will look good to THEIR bosses. No matter how hard you work, you will not be rewarded except with low wages, high stress environment. They will slash pharmacy staffing while piling on more work, making the pharmacy unsafe. It’s honestly reprehensible how they can get away with it."
bad,It is not a good company to work fore they do not value you as a workers . I do not recommend no one to work there I felt discriminated at some point when they got a new manager.
bad,Worked my butt off for years with this company and got store manager and they fired me within 8 months with no good reasons. The DL and DAPL were just out to make money off of my firing and didn’t do anything to help me out!
bad,"No real training. "
bad,"Cvs had poor management. Would work you extra hard, over your normal hours one week, and little to no hours the next week. The pay was not nearly enough for the amount of work expected from you. Co-workers never stayed long enough to give an impression."
bad,Blatant favoritism. Mind games. Micromanagement of the average nurse and no restrictions on the chosen few. Management knows how to retaliate against employees and not get caught. The job is enjoyable if you can make it into the inner circle.
bad,Being the shift supervisor was like babysitting. Most of the employee were young fresh out of high school. There were good ones but they usually leave quick.
bad,"Nothing against the people that work there, but CVS is not a job you want to have more than temporarily. It's mind numbing and it takes the customer's always right to a whole new level."
bad,My shift was from 5 am to 3 pm. I worked alone until 9 am every day and it took everything I had to not fall asleep looking at the computer screen for so many hours so early. It was such a boring job. There was really no room for advancement. The manager spent the whole day with her door wide open on the phone LOUDLY making personal calls. I do not regret leaving this place one bit!
bad,If you want to become a pharmacy technician it's a great company to start with I will say that because they will give you the hours and pay for people to get their certification if they don't already have it.
bad,"Awesome employees & very good training on new drugs, but Nursing Management plays favourites. "
bad,"CVS is a good company, may the biggest in the industry but I did not enjoy my stay with them. They made the work so stressful that you sometimes feel like a slave."
bad,"worked there for years, was stressful and at times demoralizing. I like some of my customers and management directly above me but that was it. Would not recommend working for CVS unfortunately."
bad,I never cared to work for cvs. I started working here because I needed the money badly and now I've been here almost two years this December. I work in a Long Island location which is not bad even though it is far from home but I prefer it. The company itself is not bad but its not where I wanted to be or planned to be and they are stingy with the pay.
bad,The training is good and you learn a lot. The work load is not team friendly.  Like if someone does want to do something and they ask you to do it you are expected to always say yes even when you turn around and do it they say no and expect you to do your work and theirs.
bad,Would be a good job if you had proper staffing to run the place. The amount of scoring and initiatives set in place by management makes it impossible to actually give good customer service.
bad,This review is based on a company takeover from CVS.  There was no interview as my job was eliminated in the takeover.  Compensation for severance was below industry standard.
bad,"What i learn from working at cvs is that you have to learn everything on your own, the managers will teach you little and expect a lot, the coupons are a big problem at cvs. Is not a bad pay if your a hard worker, but is gonna be real stressful because you are left on your own after a couple of leassons. As a part timer you will only be given 12 hours. There is no full time, even managers dont get full time. You have to been working for years and years to get full time."
bad,"Underpaid, underappreciated, understaffing. Managers don't  know how to run our company properly either they  firr a lot of our employees (because we are overstaffed to many workers) or employees leave on their own and CVS rarely replaces them."
bad,"Expect to work by yourself with five customers in line while you still have to stock, put tags up, answer calls and place photo orders. Managers are always busy."
bad,"CVS has the potential to be a good company, but its various things they have to work on. Full-time receives overall good benefits and the pay is good when they are not cutting back hours!! Some of the management is not fair at all as far as store managers, can't speak for all but some are self-centered, lazy, and only care if it benefits them!! If you're looking to move up in a company CVS is not it. They don't offer flexible scheduling cause store managers feel their schedule is more important than other colleagues."
bad,"Working in CVS pharmacies have been bittersweet. Most stores are understaffed, and most managers are not trained to be managers so they lack communication and leading skills. Most technicians weren't trained or the managers don't prioritize their training, so I would work 10-14 hour days compensating. Sometimes I would work 9 days in a row. Plus I traveled to other understaffed stores frequently. I was wrongfully terminated by one manager and it was swept under the rug by corporate when they rehired me and transferred my to a different store. Plus CVS pays the lowest rate in retail pharmacy.  Not much good offered."
bad,"CVS  Corporate loves hiring college graduates that have no real life experience running retail stores. The real talent in the company is the people who have done the job for years and actually know what to do. They also love to spend money on outside consultants who identify problem areas, and when the results are provided they ignore the data and continue on as usual."
bad,"This is a fast paced working environment. This is the perfect placement for someone whom is self-motivated, open minded, able to multitask and not require constant supervision. The employee must be able to stay focused, be detail oriented, confident with redirecting customers, and stand during the entire shift. The work schedule is not consistent and requires the individual to be open to any availability during hours of operation."
bad,"Horrible communication, no real way to advanced, work life doesn’t exist, for a health company they don’t care about employee health, being sick leads to being fired."
bad,"if this is a temporary job or first job this is a good option but they do not help you to grow in any way. you figure out everything on your own and if you’re doing something wrong, most likely they’ll just talk about you or move you somewhere else until you hear about it. they do not work with your schedule and move shift supervisors around. they are expected to not have any issue with this either. decent  pay, a lot of responsibilitlack of employee respect i believe."
bad,Manager was unprofessional does not take pride in the cleaning services they are hire too proform was a bad experience the works was very friendly it was a learning experience
bad,"Benefits are good.  You get 1000 in an hsa if your full time every year.  They match 401k to 5 percent.  Store manager doesn’t manage his store properly.  He’s worried more about his big bonus check, rather than his employees.  Maybe other stores are better but don’t work at this one.  I feel sorry for the overnight crew because they do all the work.  So if you decide to work here choose days."
bad,CVS has cut back the amount of employees working in the pharmacy. It is very stressful and understaffed while management expects the same amount of work to be done. You receive little to no recognition for anything. Supervisors are demanding and want the job to be done at the expense of their own people.
bad,hires too many pathological liars; poor managers. people scattered around the world. people imported from India work holidays and long hours. hire without office space available
bad,Where do I begin? Not enough hours because corperate only cares about money. District manager only cares about keeping her job and her bonus money. We went through over 4 pharm. Managers and the store was still a mess. They give pharmacist more hours than techs. Some staff believe they are managers when they are just staff who were hired to help with the store not throw everyone under the bus. A waste of time working here. Lack of communication between staff and managers. Every shift there is something new to stress about. The all anyone cares about is the numbers.
bad,Very good pay. If your a hard worker this job will be easy for you. If you can handle all sorts of situations from customers this will be a good job for you.
bad,"Corp. controls all and has no regaurd for patient safety, Not enough hours provided to keep the pharmacy staffed properly, corp.focused too much on the money in their pockets and numbers.Not people."
bad,I loved being a pharmacy tech the job and patients made my day. But my employers went behind my back and illegally fired me. I had a pending leave of absence for a cyst and before it was approved or denied they fired me for job abandonment   without any notice.
bad,Not really much support from the supervisors. They allowed customers to talk to you anyway they pleased. Hours were never enough nor was the pay. Unfortunately we still have prescriptions here.
bad,"Maybe like a lot of companies, CVS Health starting wages are low for a Warehouse, $12...Before that increase it was $9.50...CVS had problems with people staying & still do.... a lot of favoritism in the Warehouse & entire facility."
bad,"Work life balance is non existence for store managers.  Advancement opportunities for minorities are very limited, it is not based on results and productivity but rather on favoritism and polities.  Pay scale is non consistent with very large gaps for doing the same kind of work."
bad,"CVS pharmacy places profits above employees, the pharmacy I work in does not have enough hours to be fully staffed. This leads to issues with productivity because there are not enough people in the pharmacy at any one time to get things done as they would need to be done. CVS corporate does not care about this and instead pushes pharmacists to work longer and longer hours without extra pay to make up for the lack of support staff. This has been going on for a long time and there is no end in sight."
bad,Wouldn't suggest it be a smart career choice. Good starting point for people new to retail. Management gets handcuffed daily by the structure implemented by corporate.
bad,employees were treated unfairly. No place for advancement unless your popular. The hours were horrible to work when you have a life outside cvs. Management wasn't very understanding
bad,"It's not a horrible place to work, but they expect a lot out of you. And it's retail, so if course you'll be putting you with a lot of horrible customers. They clientele is 70% women, so you'll get really sweet grandmas, and plenty of......others."
bad,"A typical work day is providing medications to clients.  I learned valued information regarding medications and insurance.  The management is about numbers, therefore, staff is often overworked."
bad,"No opportunity for advancement. Benefits ok, high deductible plans. Understaffed at most CVS’s. Higher ups apply a ton of pressure on pharmacy managers, setting unrealistic goals. I don’t recommend!"
bad,"The position at the time was new. There was a lot of miscommunication with the managers, and staff.  Floor staff was very resentful and uncooperative within the company. I was told false information to get me into the company after hired they changed everything."
bad,"CVS is a great pharmacy to have your prescriptions in but not the best work place. specially in the last 2 years in Miami. After buying Navarro employees are expected to do the work of multiple people with the same pay and hours. barely have enough hours to keep the store oppen and demands and expectatios from district management keeps rising with no help to stores. Worst of it is in Miami sadly,  unless you have help from district managers promotions are near impossible. Doesnt matter your training knowledge or time in the company, when a position is open and the employee aplies they wont even get a call since most of the positions are obptained by being friendly with higher management. As a supervisor im not even allowed a lunch break and if i do punch out for one i need to work if called which is every 5 minutes."
bad,"Back in the day, CVS used to be the place to work. Great environment,  enough employees to run the store and make it look beautiful.  No all you have is 1 or 2 employees working the whole store at a time. Terribly understaffed. Managers are pulling their hair out from stress and trying to meet demands. They cut the hours every year for employees which makes them quit because of low pay. Easy target for thefts because loss prevention agents were laid off. DMs don't work with managers, just give them a list and tell them to get it done. The jobs of 4 or 5 people fall down on just 1 or 2, mainly the managers that are salary and working 70+ hours a week to make up for the 3 employees they don't have but really need. Employees can't call out sick cause there's no one to cover."
bad,they do not value employees and treat employees as expendable. its a job. i did the job. was not very happy. only did the job for money. do not recommend.
bad,"Work here if you like being micromanaged! Managemt is constantly on top of you about the tiniest things: being 1 minute late from break; cannot use the restroom unless it’s during alotted break times; you are documenting a call after it’s ended be assured you will get a questioning IM about it; people aren’t available to answer questions, so you have to call the Senior Team....yet you get marked down for calling them - total catch-22; common sense has no place here - you have to follow the work instructions constantly- no room for problem-solving or thinking outside the box"
bad,"This company doesn't pay enough for the headache, depending on where you work it may not be safe because customers threaten you if they get caught stealing, you barely get a break, benefits are based on hours worked in a certain time frame. Management don't manage in fear of losing employees."
bad,I was working Full time 50 plus hours a week and only getting one day off a week. I worked 6 days a week since I started. I was always working 12 hour shifts opening and closing and being thrown from one store to the other and completely exhausted. This job was very unfair as I was working FT hours plus and always going in covering people and got no recognition for it. I was so overworked and taken for granted and received no benefits as I was PT..Kept promising me FT benefits but would hire others and give them benefits and all.
bad,"Typical work day includes receiving, processing and filling patient prescriptions. Getting behind was very common and it could be busy the entire shift non-stop. Favoritism was abundant in this place and hours were scarce or plentiful depending on the needs of the favorites who always got first pick."
bad,I hated the fact that the store manager does everything and is responsible for all issues in the store. Other managers are basically used as cashiers and are told they are just glorified cashiers on a regular basis.
bad,"High expectations for work output with minimal provisions made for the achievement of set goals, i.e. unreasonable expectations. Big focus on corporate numbers with little to no incentive to achieve goals. Complete disregard of employee satisfaction or lack thereof."
bad,Corporate more concerned with statistics and numbers than their primary directive of promoting customer health. Constantly confusing patients with changing policies and no common sense programs. Lack of care when it comes to employee health and no concern about ergonomics considering the job is all standing.
bad,the typical day at work when the phone never stop ringing learning new compounding for units everyday when having to management your time was the hardest part of the job because every job had a certain time for orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,"this is not applicable because I rather keep my silence to not talk ill will about the company. I do love my job that I do, I love helping people out but  it can be stressful at times."
bad,I only interned there so I really didn't get a feel for how the employes feel but it seemed like a very calm enviorment. Nothing too exciting happened there.
bad,"Managers are expected to work over the required 45 hours per week, often work 6 or 7 days per week to keep the store acceptable.  Managers in high volume stores spend most of their time putting out freight, not managing the store."
bad,high stress with minimal pay for demanded workload. underappreciated and constantly behind daily tasks. Benefits may include teaching new hires to cement your skills.
bad,The job would be great if you were given the proper amount of staffing. CVS expects you to work off the clock to get everything done that they want but don't tell you to work off the clock.
bad,"Inappropriate schedules, lack of helps from management, technicians did not get fully  trained  before work at store levels, opening late at nights or too early in the morning"
bad,"Not the best job I've ever had, but then again I worked there when I was a high - schooler.  Coworkers were not very nice, always got the grunt work, etc."
bad,"Working at CVS is very hard labor for very little pay, injuries and accidents are common and the workload is seemingly endless.  At cvs you work all day for twelve hours and can be fired if you do not work fast enough."
bad,Work life balance at cvs health specialty was really hectic. I have managed well enough to meet the client requirements and the deadlines provided. Over all its a tough job but it's manageable. I have leant a lot during my service here.
bad,Hectic and demanding environment. Must be able to tolerate abusive public. Favoritism is demonstrable.  Easy to burn-out. Workers treated as robots not people
bad,"This was a very stressful job.  Full training was not offered, making it hard to fully learn the job.  This store was particularly overwhelming.  It was stressful dealing with irate customers, which happened a lot."
bad,They lie and tell you that you can be promoted but they look over u and hire outsiders if they're short handed which isnt fair. They aren't flexible with hours.
bad,"Required to work at a fast pace; if question is asked, management may not answer. Management uses reports, instead of taking each case individually to look at totals. Office seems to be Quantity of Quality."
bad,I have been a pharmacy technician for the company for five years and the company is all about saving themselves money than helping customers and employees. You can work anywhere from 8am-12pm depending on your availability. They expect you to do the work of five people without any help from management.
bad,Management and employees make working there very stressful. Not enough hours.Some employees are given special treatment over others. Shift supervisors treat employees like they are worthless.
bad,only did an externship of 80 hours got a little experience at entering prescriptions taking prescriptions at the drive up counting of pills during prescription
bad,Cvs just like most retail pharmacies overwork their technicians and pharmacists. They pile on more work and continue to cut employee hours. This causes issues with morale for the workers.
bad,The management was unorganized and had internal conflicts. Scheduling was always a hassle and employees were easily able to undermine the schedule creating chaos in the schedules of their fellow employees. I was promoted to Lead Technician even though I was the newest hire and was at the time not nationally certified.
bad,"Great place to learn. Unfortunately staff isn’t seen as a priority. Work full time, no benefits (no pto, no sick days) because in the system I work 38 hours, not full time"
bad,"Not much to say,"
bad,CVS was my actual first hands on working in the field as a pharmacy Technician I enjoyed working there and I gained ex but you cant really grow in your career here
bad,The times are changing for pharmacists. No longer are there an endless supply of jobs available. The big corporations know this now and are forcing pharmacists to work like dogs to make ends meet. There are not enough tech hours to meet the demand. Repeatedly you will be asked/forced to come in early and leave late to meet your daily work requirements. It is no longer a safe environment and all of the safety measures that are put in place cannot make up for the fact that there isn't enough time in the day to do the job effectively without cutting corners like counselling patients so that they understand their medications. There isn't sufficient time for medication profile reviews. It's unfortunate that this is what it's come to. I feel bad for all of the new grads coming out because they will be forced into this because of massive school loan debt. I do not recommend this company unless your sole purpose is to pay back loans. It will take years off of your life from the excessive stress you will endure. I wish you luck if you choose to pursue it.
bad,"Honestly, it's good stepping stone if you're dumb. The original manager was a great man who left to pursue a real career. The next manager was worthless."
bad,"A typical day meant no lunch or scheduled lunch, no scheduled breaks, six to 14 continuous hours of standing, frequent computer problems/downtime, staffing to meet 85% of demand and neck pain."
bad,This was a challenging time to be employed by CVS.  I came in during an acquisition and there was a lot of leadership and colleague turnover.  Projects stagnated.
bad,"One of the most disappointing places I have ever worked in. The company clearly only cares about profit and cares little for their employees. For a company that makes so much revenue every year, it was very disappointing to see how little they care about their employees. The overall morale is low because it's very apparent as to how little the company cares for its people."
bad,"would not recommend this employer to anyone, very negative, the rules only apply to certain ones, highly aggressive when someone speaks truthfully on the company"
bad,u only get promoted if u kiss butt. they want u to do too much with only 2 employees. they do not appreciate hard work and effort. very cliquey company. its not what u do its who u know
bad,"Well, CVS bought eckerds but the job environment unfortunately  stayed the same.It was very stressful we never had enough help. I was doing most of the work and at times working by myself."
bad,One of the top priority of CVS/Caremark is the bottom line. Prepare to work smart and ready to do whatever it takes to meet the priority or refresh your resume ASAP.
bad,"CVS would have been a great place to work at if they trained you a lot better and if they hired a lot better people to be in charge. There's such a shortage that they hire whoever they can and it's often horrible people that shouldn't be around humans at all. Some CVS locations are different than others, but all are over worked, underpaid, and not trained well. We had a horrible new pharmacist come into our location that was harassing, bullying, and yelling at employees and customers... everyone complained for months, including the customers. That pharmacist is still there, getting horrible ratings... and all of the other workers left. Literally every worker. This is how bad things are. HR doesn't do anything to solve issues. They would rather keep terrible people in charge than search for and train good people. It's not worth it. Everything is terrible. Nothing is good. It's really how it is. There's never enough people working so you'll never have a day where you aren't stressed. Pharmacists don't even get a lunch break and they'll work over 12 hours. It's insane. I've never worked at a company so unprofessional and so uncaring. When you do get ""trained"" you only do so much. The trainers usually spend their time complaining and not really helping. There's so much negativity in this company that you will never be happy again. I was so stressed from this job that I had severe medical issues from stress. It is NOT worth it at all."
bad,"I was hired as a staff pharmacist for one location. But, all along, they had me slated for a 3rd shift position due to my past experience. The hour for 3rd shift were different than my previous. My health suffered."
bad,"CVS offers many company wide activities for employees to participate in. One of those was a ""walk-a-thon"", where employees could track their daily steps towards earnings prizes."
bad,"The job is listed as having one set of guidelines and proceedures, yet once you actually get there, the actual working proceedures are not what was advertised."
bad,My local CVS Pharmacy is a nice pharmacy. The  people are always friendly and the store is really clean. The prices and coupons are outstanding. I would recommend the pharmacy to anyone.
bad,"In a typical day duties include: processing prescriptions, answering the phones, assisting customers, helping them with items (not related to the pharmacy). "
bad,"Over worked, under staffed, mediocre pay and benefits. You will cover multiple positions and for others daily. Micro management and no true leadership. Toxic culture. Old damaged equipment, furniture, relies on contractors, incompatible tech and compliance issues.  Company will decide your schedule."
bad,"I'm still not sure if anything ever gets done in a call center,  Meetings to discuss policies that never get implemented.  Working with people who have brain damage that cause undo stress.  Too much red tape in this corporate world for anything to be done correctly.  Just my two cents!"
bad,"Very unorganized. Computers break down every day. computer programs work some days, some days not. For a corporate company they have way to many little problems that add up."
bad,"I love the job that I do, but management does not know what they are doing and that makes  for a very stressful work environment. They do provide training to prepare you for your role."
bad,At the hub where I’m at if you’re not a favorite your are not advancing in your job. The company is not family oriented. It’s poorly managed and since Cvs took over its worse than its ever been. You’re treated like second rated citizens.
bad,"Only care about the customer not the employees. When employees are right, they are still wrong in management eyes. All about the bottom line for them. Customer happiness is all they care about"
bad,"When I first started at cvs, I was so excited about learning new things and helping people. I have learned lots of things, unfortunately, not all are good. This job can be emotionally and physically draining at times. It is a very stressful environment, but I can handle that. the company doe not treat their employees very well. I believe its more about the money and profit than anything else. The hardest part of the job can be all the gray areas. Not everyone is on the same page and that can be extremely frustrating. I love meeting new customers and actually getting a chance to talk with them, however that rarely happens. The company continually adds more to the workload and gives us less hours in which to do the work."
bad,"I wouldn't know where to start, where to connect or where to end. I just have really nothing to say other than it's close to the mall, and that's it.."
bad,"This company only cares about their numbers any money, stores cannot even get things fixed without spending two hours on the phone with someone over a span of 2 weeks.  They dont care about the fact that their employees are overworked and underpaid"
bad,"A typical day consists of answering calls from customers who have questions about their medication such as refills, what local pharmacy they can pick it up at, and how much it will cost."
bad,"Very busy place to work with one technician and pharmacist. Technician had to enter prescriptions, dispense medication, order drugs, answer phones and ring people up at the till"
bad,"I was so excited to start working at CVS but soon realized I was wrong. They made it so difficult to even get started working. I was hired as a Pharmacy Tech but had to work as a cashier for 2 months, which I was told would take a month at most. Once I got to the pharmacy I was stuck up on the register all day which is not what I singed up for. Then I was scheduled crazy hours. Like working 40 hours a week while going to school full time. Mind you I am a part time position. Being scheduled to work on days I have school then being told to figure it out because they are short. Being called the ""fill or extra employee"" thats why I get cray extra hours and terrible shifts. Then being told I need to finish what I am doing but ""punch out"" and basically work for the last 15 minutes I had to stay late for free. Overall the pay is decent but this is not the job or work environment I was promised upon applying and being hired. Would not recommend."
bad,CVS has lost it's way It does not prioritize customer service. The store employees are cynically impolite with pharmacy and front end retail customers. Overall i disliked the negative rude mistreatment of customers exhibited by colleagues and management.
bad,The company only cares about the numbers and the most useless reporting but doesnt care about our patients or their own employees. Every week theres a new report that im forced to discuss with my staff or forced to call hundreds of patients every weekend just to get then to fill their medication (and make the company more money).
bad,"Expected to put in extra hours only for the sake of putting in hours. Has an atmosphere of working harder but not smarter. Not focused on the customers (patients), just focused on the bottom dollar."
bad,"A Typical day can be insane, depending on how busy the location. Never enough staff.  Customers endure extremely long lines. Lines with 10 or more customers, for several hours is not unheard of.  Not enough registers to handle flow of customers, even if they had the staff, at some locations. "
bad,"Management doesn't care about you as long you do your job. They constantly change the rules, and then they don;t know which rules you should be following. they are not happy unless you live at work."
bad,"I've been working at a LTC Florida branch since 2011. I am knowledgeable about the majority of the ins and outs of the pharmacy floor, as I the only roles I haven't done are intake, adjudication, full time staging, or running either of the machines. I have been part of the backbone of my department for the last 3 years as I am the longest running technician on the Overnight shift. "
bad,formerly known as omnicare this place sucks. literally. they hire any and everybody. thye make promises that they font keep. and they act like pnaera bagels are gold. pay people more money and hire more competent workers.
bad,"In the beginning it was ok, down the years Ive been working for this company, hours were getting cut repeatedly to working about 20 hours per week at 4 hours a day. Was not enough to support my family."
bad,The job was prefect on till they hired some new guy that tried everything in his power to get me fired but nothing work i just got so sick of the lack of disrespect the manager had to me and him himself didnt care about the guy trying to get me fired
bad,"Loved my coworkers, but the environment was stressful. Everything is rated and reviewed by corporate, even things that are out of your control as a technician and pharmacist. All scripts are timed. You must be on your top game at all times, it is very easy to make a mistake, especially since you are not given the hours to have a decent amount of staff during shifts."
bad,Management was clueless for solving issues always waited until it was a crisis before taking action. Supervisor favoritism. Lack of professionalism even at supervisor and management level
bad,Difficult to advance once you are a CCR3. Management has their hand picked favorites and least favorites. No interaction from Management unless you are doing something wrong. Never acknowledges famous for service . My supervisor was not very active with the employees. There always seems to be irritated customers because of Aetna's coverage. Be prepared to hear an earful all day with back to back calls.
bad,could have got paid more but great beneifts I like it for the most part off on weekend prolly work one every month but was good knew what time you were gonna get off.
bad,Overall I love the experience gained at Cvs. I loved helping patients on a daily basis. I love training new employees on the job. However the company had poor management. Not bashing just being honest.
bad,Dont care for it at all. I feel very unappreciated working for cvs. I do not feel valued as an employee. The work is also to stressful for the amount that we are paid.
bad,"the job would be much better if the schedule was consistent.  One week I would have ten hours and the other week I would have 30 hours.  so, it's not a great job for someone with bills."
bad,Not a great company to work for employees are generally expected to acomplish the work of two or three people in a day. Stores never have enough hours to give out and middle and upper management are unresponsive to problems at the store level.
bad,"CVS is not the best company to work for, Its an entry level job and not a career. In comparison to its competitors such as Walgreen or pub-lix, Cashier and techs are not paid well. There are a ridiculous amount of procedure and HR related policies you'll have to deal with as well. This includes being graded on work performance every month. Customer service is important and you'll be judged severely on how good at that you are. In the summers all store hours are cut pretty bad so you'll have to work at multiple stores to cover your hours. In the end its a corporation, they all suck to work for and many don't really care about their employees. the only upside i can tell is that its a secure job. its hard to be fired and if you want to become a licensed pharmacy technician its a very easy path through CVS."
bad,cvs scrambling to compete with amazon threat so less focused on employees as people. overworks them and not compensated enough for the amount of work asked of their employees
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. It is a revolving door for Managers. The Chemung, NY DC has a terrible time retaining hourly employees due to a poor work life balance. The Parent company overloaded the DC with work due to a perception that the DC could pick pieces for a lower cost per piece. One of the VP's of Distribution was routinely voicing his political opinions. It made you feel very uncomfortable. Sorry but the company was more concerned with gaining scripts than providing a good working environment."
bad,"A very competitive unfair company to work for with little to no room for job advancement. Even though the medical benefits are readily available, they are very expensive"
bad,Probably the toughest job anyone will ever have. You are always standing on your feet. Always getting yelled at when nothing is your fault. We take the heat as the middlemen between the insurance and the patients.
bad,"I loved working at CVS but recently ,job opportunities have dried up . It seems it is going to people already decided without looking at job skills or resume"
bad,"I've been a CVS pharmacist almost 7 years. A typical day at work means you show up to your 13-hour shift with one or two technicians, barely keep up with workflow if you're lucky, and hardly get a bathroom break, let alone eat. Management expects you to get work done on days off, even if you need to be in the store to do it. On top of that, you're expected to hit every number every month, and even if you lose 3 technicians in a month (like I did) you get no wiggle room and still get a tongue-lashing because you didn't hit all your numbers. Even if you've taken on the difficult jobs in the company, you'll never be good enough for management unless you perform perfectly each month. Management cares more about its numbers than its people."
bad,Process anywhere between 150-300 prescriptions a day. Workplace has a real family environment feel. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers in their time of need and facilitating relationships.
bad,"CVS pharmacy, not a good place to work because the management is very poor their location is not bad the payment is not attractive they do not encourage the employee"
bad,"A typical day at work tended to be understaffed, but tried to still succeed with the best customer service. I learned that I wanted more out of a company. The management was okay, but never anything spectacular as the company tends to play favorites. The hardest part of the job was the pay and being understaffed, and the best part were the regular customers."
bad,The best part of the job at CVS was the camaraderie that we developed over years of working throughout the company. The company itself is awful to it's employees and treats their pharmacist badly.
bad,The hardest part about the job is work life balance. things are always changing. High turn over rate. Over worked and underpaid. No time for family. Lots of new patients everyday
bad,"Too many temporary positions in the pool and not enough work."
bad,"I worked there happily for years until management changed"
bad,"It was plain no expectation. If no work available, you were sent home. Hours were different from day to day. Trainer smoked like crazy, no thought about the person having to sit next to you. Just a job nothing more no advancement. Sometimes just sat there looking for work."
bad,It was my first job and I had a bad experience. My manager did not train me and was nowhere to be found when I had questions. There was a lot of favoritism too.
bad,"CVS is a good place to work if you are a people person,  The people come in sick or have some medications they can' go without.. I learned to be patient with people and to always put yourself in that sick person place."
bad,"i was not happy there. the culture is so stressful and utilitarian, too many demands not enough training also seems there was bias  especially in internal advancement so much was plitilical"
bad,"Technicians are not valued at CVS. Pharmacists are over worked. Compensation is extremely inadequate, thus, high turnover. The work is arduous. A technician must be adept at multi-tasking in a high-stress environment for extremely low pay."
bad,Creating a patient profile by adding personal information and insurance provider.
bad,A typical day at work involved doing the daily functions of a pharmacy technician. The management was working under the supervision of a pharmacist. The pharmacists were often under high levels of stress. The training was not established so well at the time I was working there. I did not feel that management really provided enough recognition.
bad,This company is very stressful always short staff company and they do not pay enough for living cost very inconsiderate and only think about how they can use techs to cover shifts
bad,Pharmacy Technicians were underpaid and most of them including the pharmacist were overworked. Lack of communication and rotating pharmacist made the execution of timely pickups difficult and stressful.
bad,your must work as a team and have open communication for a smooth work flow environment. scheduling fairly is very important and showing your appreciation to your employees feel good.
bad,"not somewhere to stay for the long run, poor management too many outstanding rules not a good environment to be in needs to be better management for cvs"
bad,Some employees didn't like to complete all of their work and expected other employees to pick up their slack. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with not only your work but also the work of other people. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with all of our customers and helping them feel better.
bad,"Would rather no! Nothing else to say thank you. I dont want any problems I need the small income!"
bad,Was on the phones 24/7 and management didn't really care about you being sick or having kids or if you needed days off. You had to show up or get wrote up.
bad,"really the only reason to work at CVS is to get trained as a pharm tech and have them fund it/pay for it. after that, get the heck out. absolutely no reason to stick around."
bad,"don't really remember too much about it, it was too long ago. I do remember it was pretty boring, the same thing day in and day out. just go tot be to monotonous."
bad,Always under staffed. Never get recognization for any accomplishment that were achieved.  Never able to do you work in your area before you are pulled to help someone else that isn't able to complete there own work.
bad,Even though I worked at CVS I didn't really enjoy it I feel that the best part of the job was the people there (some of them at least) looking back at it now I kind of regret working there.
bad,Focus for CVS was on metrics only.  Fill as many prescriptions as possible in as short a time as possible.  Managers often discouraged Pharmacists from complying with state laws in favor of metrics.
bad,"I did not like working there , it was not fun , too many rules and too little pay . no discounts of any kind . always felt like someone was watching you ."
bad,excellent company to get experience and work. Great team work. Excellent benefits. And flexible working Hours. Provide training to new employee so when you get start your work in the begining without any problem.
bad,"due to working in a silo, you work on singular projects and BAU. When attempting to integrate processes from multiple depts, it becomes chaos with protections developed related to the worst work habits. This poor developed database has created poor data reporting and multiple hours to correct with limited support from Sr. and Executive Management who are out to protect the analysts and managers who created the problems because they, the Sr/Executive team, have placed these people on a promotion track."
bad,"This review is for one of the specialty pharmacies that CVS purchased as part of a larger acquisition of Omnicare. CVS has made integrating with their larger business systems and infrastructure almost impossible. Our patients are siphoned off by larger business units, and we are unable to pursue legal leads because of either incompetence or inaction by the larger structure, leading our team into slow motion liquidation. The company culture can be summed up as arbitrary and confusing, as different leadership teams send often opposing directives on a weekly basis which we have learned to ignore."
bad,"its a good place to start off, the management is decent but could use some help. its hard to move up if you are not a favorite in their eyes. but decent hours and location."
bad,high demand and poorly managed. The people make the work environment great other than that its a bit chaos and really inconsistent with how they act versus what they expect.
bad,"No job security, management doesn't care about you, deal with a lot of spoiled customers who want everything their way, work long hours with no break, hire a bunch of people than fires a bun chance of people.  I would hate to ever go back."
bad,"The dept I worked in, lacked diversity towards minorites and valued the contract workers from overseas over the full time employees."
bad,"My daughter ""fair warned"" me about serving CVS due to my hearing complications. She worked CVS Retail as a Pharmaceutical Technician in Tucson. I served Scottsdale location for 2 months as a Temp to Hire. On the day prior to my 2nd month, the manager contacted Security and had my badge terminated due to complications with another colleague. They did not handle my complaints with another person valid and ""released"" me. I found out the Next Monday when I tried to enter the property in time for work."
bad,"CVS is a very high paced work place. Pay is not nearly enough for all that the job entails. You do everything from typing in prescription to counting medications, cashier duties, and cleaning for 9.00 an hour. Not worth the stress."
bad,"Work with a team a lot which is nice, but the job is way more demanding than what it pays for, particularly when stores are always busy and understaffed. Very stressful and fast paced, but good healthcare field experience overall."
bad,"I use to love this job now it has become horrible. There is little to no communication between management/supervisors/leads to IVS reps which makes it hard to effectively do our job. Mandatory OT every Monday and at the end of the month. Along with an ""end of shift"" rule which means you are to stay until all referrals that fell in 30mins prior to the end of your shift must be completed before you leave-this usually leads to OT almost everyday(anywhere from 20mins to 90mins). Must meet daily requirements for referrals worked along with meeting quality standards. There is no formal training. Most updates to procedures are done via email."
bad,"Do not wish to review the company, a typical day at work, management, workplace culture or any such information. Learned a lot from the work experience."
bad,"The pharmacy was in an older CVS store. It was tiny and dirty.  The Pharmacist engaged in very inappropriate conversations, seemed not manager material.  The pharmacy techs were territorial, mean, and overworked."
bad,I would not go back to CVS.  I had a very unfortunate experience working at CVS and did not feel safe in the work environment.  I would not recommend it to a friend.  They did not pay appropriately for the amount of work conducted and the responsibilities.
bad,My group was considered the laughing stock of the company because of how we were treated at times. Pay did not equal the workload we were asked to handle
bad,"This company will work you to death and then some but will give you very little in return.  For a company dedicated to keeping people healthy, they don't care about their employees' health.  I also had an issue with a manager sexually harassing me that went to HR and upper management did nothing about it."
bad,"Everything was fine until CVS bought out the company and made promises they didn't keep. Employees were laid off without notice and the extra work was left for everyone else to do, with no adjustments to schedules. It was very overwhelming for many of us and we were often stressed and overloaded with tasks we could not complete to meet metrics."
bad,"understaffed, overworked, poor management in most stores.  I was a floater and saw all of these elements in most that I entered.  most of the staff were ok, just the environment wasn't good."
bad,For how much work technician does the pay is not equal to it. In order to even have a full understanding of the job it takes at least a year of learning all the skills required to be able to do everything below the pharmacists.
bad,"The pay is good, but Management and the culture are not supportive.  Its either you know or don't.  You better be willing to teach yourself, and fast."
bad,"*Very fast paced high volume pharmacy filling prescriptions and assisting a high volume of customers."
bad,"Our hours were sometimes coming in a 6 and working until 9 (closing), it wasn't worth the gas money.  I extremely enjoyed the customer relations but you couldn't have that exchange for long because of the workload without having enough people to cover it.  Felt rushed while trying to explain the medication and that sometimes made it uncomfortable for both me and the patient."
bad,"I really think is sad when employees come to management with ideas to help make the company better, and management ignores you. Also, you can't manage anyone if you have no idea how to do the job yourself. Lead and others with gradually follow, and unfortunately its more like listen to me or i'll write you up. Kind of like a ""mean girls"" vibe when working there. There are really great technicians that work here, but get overlooked because management doesn't care. Never worked for a company where management places uplifting, motivating, and supporting their staff last to none. You know its real when facilities speak numbers by leaving."
bad,"Very abusive company, they work you like a dog, and constantly subject you to minute rules mandatory overtime and do value your dedication to the company. They use you up and spit you out!!!!"
bad,"fast paced production that under paid staff,long hours working.  the work culture was laxed, too many supervisors hangouts with staff, very unprofessional."
bad,Very stressful. Every one gets paid different.  Every thing is scored and competitive. Good job to be at for experience and learn about pharmacy. Not for everyone.
bad,"All CVS cares about is the money. They treat the employers like numbers to meet their yearly quota, not considering their employees. We get tons and tons of new programs loaded to us, promising a better work environment, yet most of the time, we have to troubleshoot these programs because they keep crashing. Customers get upset at us for every little thing which we can't control, but CVS wants us to take the insults in exchange of the mere chump change the technicians get. They cramp us with 10 years' work in 24 measly hours."
bad,"I'm looking for a new job for a reason, the pay is not great. I stay now because I do like my Co workers & my direct supervisor. The rest of the company just wants us to do more for less money & less hours"
bad,Only good thing about this company now is that you are not late until 9am. Come in and work your 8 hours then you are done. Communication from/between management is really bad. Only some people will be updated with some information/changes and some only found out about it after months already past and heard the word around the office.
bad,Informed insurance members of their plan coverage and co pays.  Keeping up with the daily plan changes.  We observed most holidays with decorations and free lunches.
bad,"The customers complain because the workers are very unprofessional. We have less workers because no one can handle the unprofessional management of the job. Also, the pay is bad for technicians as it is for pharmacists. The hours are not fairly distributed as far as availability."
bad,CVS always cuts hours and expects us to work less but faster. It was a stressful environment. I do not approve of how management is handling with short staff.
bad,"Get in on the phones, schedule refills of life critical medications (Oncology, Ms, RA, etc). You learn day by day,how to assist patients further without you reaching for aid. If your supervisor likes you, it's better for you. If not overlooked, overshadowed. Few career advancing opportuites with a fairly non-existent tuition farthing , and will reel you in with flexible scheduling but in all reality mandatory by seniority or as I mentioned if your supervisor likes you. Scheduled breaks alert by system, great teamwork efforts by colleagues."
bad,There is always too many things to get done and not enough working. the people who are working are forced to make for less people by working every second of there shift no breaks not stopping except for your lunch. pay is OK but you can never advance and you have to work most of the holidays.
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy at CVS and became very stressed. Although I had gone to college and obtained my certification, I felt that I was significantly underpaid for the knowledge that I had. The only way to advance in the pharmacy was if someone left (which no one ever did), or if I went back to school and became a Pharmacist. The reason that drove me to leave was that I had a family death, and the manager was not understanding about why I needed time off. I hadn't reach a year yet and they docked my attendance for taking a day off to see a dying family member. Would not work here again."
bad,I worked at Omnicare before CVS bought them out so I don't know how the situation has changed. We had terrible management and it was organized horrifically.
bad,The people who work in Omnicare are not fair. They don't look at performance but instead they look at who you know and who referred you to the company. The upper management doesn't look at your performance.
bad,"Coworkers are horrible, constantly throwing you under the bus, more like competition than coworkers. Everyone want to be in your business, lots of ego, constant micromanaging, favoritism among management, nasty bathrooms, the worst culture ever, low morality, high health benefits, terrible training."
bad,"Not enough compensation for the job."
bad,"My experience at CVS Caremark was regrettable. I was fired after over 2 years on the job with no warning or write-ups. The supervisors in the Doctor Calls/Front End department have no idea what they want the departments to be or what exactly the job functions are. My supervisor would systematically target a few employees that either raised her ire or would not suck up to her and she would try her hardest to nail them for something that would lead to either a termination or write-up. Also, they changed the sick day policy from 40 total hours a year (Jan thru Dec) to 5 days (march thru march). The reason this is bad is because you have to leave an hour early under the old policy it counted 1 hour; you have to leave an hour early under the new policy it counts 1/2 a day."
bad,Supervisor states store is not meeting numbers despite staying late and working extra hours. It was very stressful to work there and supervisor was always dissatisfied.
bad,I enjoyed working for CVS. The fast paced environment allowed the days to go by fast and I am definitely a people person so I loved meeting new people.
bad,Even though it was a large company there were very limited opportunities for growth. My peers and I did a fairly good job at fostering a positive work environment.
bad,I worked at CVS only a short while. The teams are small which is good because you know everyone. Down side is if one person doesn’t like you and they’re anywhere close to management you’re kind of screwed. CVS likes to provide top dollar care at as low of a cost as possible so we were always extremely understaffed even though we were a high volume store. So that top dollar care they try to provide usually ends up being slow to come to patients in need. I would never recommend anyone to work at cvs that didn’t have to.
bad,"refill scripts, handle phone calls, insert prescriptions into the computer and run thru insurance. Help customers when picking up their medicine, ringing out the customer."
bad,"very stressful, u r on timer & when u get promised good raise/promotion,  don't come throu. could care less bout personal life & schedule is out wack."
bad,Cvs is a good place for benefits but not for everyone. It is slower paced at times and can become boring if you are a fast paced persons such as i am.
bad,CVS does not compensate its techs thats why they have a high turnaround rate. Not a good place to work. They train you well but do not pay well at all.
bad,I found that working for LONGS was better than that of CVS. I was pretty much told I had to be available 7 days a week even though I had classes I was taking and couldn't be available on the days they were demanding I be available. My co-workers were nice and helped me better myself when I asked for it.
bad,Management was very cutthroat. Management made sure they promoted their favorites and got rid of the rest. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,This company pays their employees by the penny and even the benefits are worse than the pay. No employee appreciation programs and doesn't mind cutting hours for the benefit of the company.
bad,I enjoyed my time and experience of working for CVS pharmacy. I learned how to improve my skills of communication and working as a team. I would recommend others.
bad,"Stressful! I would not recommend this job except as an entry level position. Low wages, high stress levels, poor management. Customer service is extremely challenging and work load is high."
bad,I'm required to write on Indeed about this job even if I barely remembered anything about it. I remember getting a job at CVS and not liking it - I was young and didn't know if the job would stick to me at all.
bad,"Stressful job, lack of proper management, i like to get to know each one of my patients but with such a stressful and fast-paced environment you don't get a chance to get to know any of them and instead have to rush the conversation to not have the other patients waiting"
bad,"answered phones, typed in prescriptions, checked out customers both at the counter and drive through, filled prescriptions, stocked the shelves and ordered new product."
bad,"a typical day at work was long computers phones and fax machines broke daily, was never trained properly was not given the proper tool needed to complete the job management treated employees unfair and unkind. The hardest part of the job was the job itself because I was not properly trained or didn't have the tools or equipment I needed. the most enjoyable part of the job was lunch and getting paid"
bad,"Stressful work enviroment. "
bad,"horrible.. low pay, no benefits, work every weekend, all night shifts, very cliquey. I wouldnt recommend working here to my worst enemy. Terrible place."
bad,"It was very OK.."
bad,Workplace culture did not involve adequate breaks for salaried staff. Great training plan and always updating on important modules. too much unpaid overtime
bad,CVS isn't a bad company.Pharmacy Manager is a shame.not the most pleasant person to deal with.needs training on how to be personable and treat others.
bad,Learned more about medications and working with customers. Learned how to decipher dr notes and what medications will help with what condition. It was a hard job but got it done
bad,If you are not a fast-paced worker or a worker that doesn't like a heavy workload than this is not the job for you. You get plenty of experience. My managers are excellent.
bad,"This company is no longer in business due to issues they were having with state reviews, and low admission rates caused by poor reviews. Many families were not happy with the care their loved ones were receiving, there were bed bug infestations, and bad press in the news."
bad,Technicians do not get paid enough for the load of work corporate puts on our shoulders. Benefits are good no doubt but its not worth it to me any longer. Under paid and unappreciated after 6 and a half years of being a truly hard working employee. They also play favortism to those who are less hard working just because the manager might be friends with them just because they goof off more than get work done. Doesn't seem like a very professional workplace.
bad,"CVS was my first job as a pharmacy tech. I did pretty much everything there as in, working the register, drive thru, entering prescriptions and filling medications."
bad,"When I started the job I got very unstructured training. I sat with different people everyday and felt I was ""up in the air"" everyday. Did not know what I was going to be doing next as management didn't know either. There is too much work to be done at the company with not enough people. They assume everyone will be staying late and will take on everything, you don't feel any satisfaction by doing all of the work you are doing, you are just expected to do more until you can't anymore."
bad,"CVS is a horrible company to work for in my experience. They do not care about their customers or employees, especially in the pharmacy. They want to invest as little money as possible at the cost of their employees and customers."
bad,Your day consists of running around constantly trying to do every task correctly but failing due to a lack of help. District management is too demanding and rude to employees. They don't care about patients. Just their scores.
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy as a tech for 18 months and it was awful. Started out ok, but after the new year it got worse and worse. Someone transferred and she was never replaced. We had our hours cut due to low customer satisfaction (can't have happy customers when you don't have enough staff) so we had to do more with even less. I liked the people I worked with and they were the only thing keeping me going at the end. I got to a point where I could feel the lifeblood drain out of me by the time I got back to the pharmacy, I packed on 20 lbs because of the stress and I got sick constantly. They also took my ins because I didn't average 30 hours a week for the previous year (I'd been out for a month after knee surgery and and never got scheduled more than 18-20 hours in a week anyways. It was a nightmare and CVS doesn't care about their associates at all. They care about $$, that's it."
bad,"The retail pharmacy is so over worked, and under staffed. The store I worked at they had the person counting the medications (filling 500 scripts a day) answering the drive thru at the same time. That means that person is taking in new prescriptions, checking out filled prescriptions, and counting the medications to be filled all at the same time. Doesn't sound like a good idea to me. They pay their technicians horribly for the amount of work they do. Especially with CVS being a extremely large company, I think they can afford to pay their technicians a little better than that."
bad,The CVS/pharmacy company is a very poor working environment. The register feels. like your fighting with someone. The register cause pain to the elbow and joints. The CVS/pharmacy pay low wages and the hours and days are fluctuating.
bad,"Management is petty and micromanaging. Your ideas are never valued and frowned upon. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, just stick to your job. Technicians are unprofessional as well. Taletailing is promoted and welcomed. Childish behavior is rampant even with uper management. Very stressful place to work, you will never see what's coming. Pharmacists are not respected at all. Don't work here!!!"
bad,"CVS Pharmacy was the first pharmacy I gained experience at in the world of pharmacy. It was always busy. Management was ok but the work flow wasn't organized which was the main cause for delays."
bad,I worked there for 10 years. I had to give up my positions there once we moved and new management took over. I had a company car with a gas card and one day my card did not work. I went to my boss and he had no idea why.
bad,"limited opportunities for growth/advancement, poor working conditions e.g no breaks and being on your feet for really long hours has a huge impact on job satisfaction."
bad,not to much to say about that job i needed work and someone helped me get bin until i was able to find better was not really my type of work the people don't respect you something i would not want to do again
bad,"I don't like the system at the pharmacy. We break more HIPAA laws checking a customer out than we do when we access the computer system. CVS, in my opinion, doesn't show ""value"" to its employees in the pharmacies. The Pharmacists usually work open to close with no lunch break during the week. This can end up being a 13-15 hour shift."
bad,I am not interested in giving reviews about my own personal work experience but this field is required so I am taking the time to just fill this space.
bad,"The management was fine but the people that I worked with who were also techs were arrogant, not willing to help someone new, and were outright rude. Would never return."
bad,"I worked for CVS Health for 2 years. It was my first full-time job, and I was initially excited for where this company could take me. After a little over a year I soon realized I was trapped in a dead end job with terrible management. The atmosphere was indescribably negative, and everyone led a complacent life with no aspiration of truly bettering themselves. I paid for health benefits for 2 years that were supposed to supply a company contribution to my HSA of $1,000 per year. I only ever saw $400 and fought for over a year to gain the rest which never occurred. I would recommend anyone to work here."
bad,I really enjoyed my co workers but the company was continuously cutting our hours and leaving us short handed but expected us to run ragged beyond comprehension
bad,Employees are under paid it is a very stressful environment. They are not willing to work with your schedule. It was hard to request days off and get them approved.
bad,"Extremely stressful environment at times, which lead to a lack of professionalism. Always under staffed which meant you could not rely on set schedule. Rarely able to leave on time. Under paid for job expectations."
bad,its been years since i was employed by cvs but i do remeber the staff and management was very unprofessional i also remeber not having enough funding for thier employess . our hours woud get cut in the middle of a shift
bad,company is ok but just the management inst that great they need to hire better people for those positions. also they need people that will help you when you need to talk to someone in hr because their hr staff isnt the best.
bad,"great pay but lousy management, rearly hires new managers within the company, hard to move up in the company, expect long hours durring the holiday season and lots of vto durring no peak months"
bad,"Your health will decline quickly. The stress is unbearable. You start taking calls early on in training, even though you have no clue what to do. They do have helpers walking around, but it's awful. The system isn't user friendly, thus making it difficult to figure out if you've done your job properly. ""Members"" are usually angry and take it out on CCRs in the call center. CCRs are told they must accept the verbal abuse."
bad,"Working as a pharmacist at CVS is like working in a sweatshop.  There is very little help, they demand more from you than is humanly possible, there are no breaks whatsoever and often you will work completely alone.  Techs in the free standing stores are far better than the techs in the CVSs in the Target stores."
bad,The store I was in when through a new manager coming in and left me up in the air with what I was told I was hired for. There wasn't any good direction from the new manager. I wasn't happy with the company at all.
bad,"I left CVS over two year ago, because the work life became to stressful.  Working culture promotes, working with limited resources and help, and usually on a metric driven system."
bad,"There will be very little in the way of raises or promotions and don't expect that you will get the schedule you were promised in your interview. The company has a very hard time keeping staff and pharmacists."
bad,"Customer service, filled and refilled customer prescriptions. Clarified prescriptions if needed with doctor office. Inventory control. Stocking merchandise and medications"
bad,"worked in the pharmacy there. there was some lapse in a credential that resulted in a state board hearing. CVS chose not to defend or indemnify any of the employees, but instead made them all take a fall and pay fines out of their own pockets. isnt that what an LLC is for to begin with? sheesh."
bad,I was not too fond of working here. The managers were very closed minded and not open to promote. I did enjoy the discounts and extra bucks but I received no benefits.
bad,"I would not recommend this company to work for. They were understaffed, underpayed, and  over worked. The management of the store was unreasonable and difficult to work with. I did enjoy the people I worked with. We  made a great team and really relied on each other."
bad,enjoyed working there job was fast paced and high action but was always difficult to get time off and payroll issues. overall would work there again under different management
bad,i liked the job but i had to relocate a typical day at work i dealt with customer and expedited prescriptions it was a specialty pharmacy and we dealt with specialty drugs
bad,Not a good environment. Under staffed and over worked. Management is immature and unorganized. Would not go back to work there ever again because of previous experience.
bad,"Typical day at CVS, is mainly filling prescriptions in a timely manner, answer any questions about drugs and interactions. Also being able to provide each and every customer with excellent service"
bad,will keep you busy. okay place to work for . didn't care for driving and delivery in NY city and NJ at all. keeping a delivery schedule was almost impossible. hand unloaded freight
bad,Haven't been working here long so I don't feel comfortable giving my opinion. There have been multiple policy changes since I've started so it's hard to say how I feel because I'm still adjusting to the changes and I'm also still in training.
bad,Is an okay company to work for although their rotated schedules don't fit with my family and I have been struggling lot due to these late shifts and last minute notifications of changes
bad,long hours and not enough technician help - you could work 12 hour days with minimum tech help or none at all at times - the budget is always cutting tech hours making the pharmacist job more challenging
bad,its ok to start off working here but you need to expand outward to really grow and go get somewhere. you will meet some great people who you want to work for but at the same time you will meet people who arent so great
bad,"not good, bad benefits, they don't treat you well, not enough help."
bad,"A typical day at work incudes transcribing prescriptions via phone and paper, filling and dispensing medications. In addition, patient counseling with each medication dispensed."
bad,"Run store at a professional level. By delegating staff. Keep moving, put up Plano-grams. Put away truck, out inventory. Make sure ever guest is properly taking care of. The hardest part of my job is to control Loss. I enjoy dealing with customers and learning new things."
bad,"A good friend is many things. He is loyal, trustworthy, comforting, loving, caring, honest, fair, positive, and happy. He should stay by your side no matter what happens and someone you would trust with your life. That is who a good friend is. If you do by any chance have a great friend, you should try to keep him for as long as you live, because good friends are hard to find."
bad,The work is consistent. There are many medial task that you are responsible for yet have no control over. The work is demanding and you have little to no time for breaks. Most people don't know what a break is. The management is horrible in almost every store you go into. The working conditions are horrendous. It's got to be the worst pharmacy company to work for. I know they are the lowest paid.
bad,"Not enough employees, and not enough hours to give. There is always work to do, and we can't get to do everything, This take away from the customer Service Experience,"
bad,"Technicians in charge..pharmacists are not empowered, computer is archaic and patched.  Customer approval questionable. "
bad,"Adequate salary but little to no work/life balance especially if you're a manager. Goals would be manageable if the stores were properly staffed, however, that is an almost impossible task with the state of the hiring system. New hires commonly take one to two months to reach the store level. Due to low margins in the retail pharmacy space, the culture is one of getting prescriptions out quickly no matter how dangerous to patients that might be. Myself and many pharmacists I've worked with have thought of walking out due to stress and unattainable goals. Your experience may vary widely depending on what store/district you are in, but I've heard the same story from many people."
bad,"Hardest part of the job is doing everything possible you can do for the customer, and some how there's still problems. Co-workers hand off all problems on me when its time for their end of their shift."
bad,Depending on your store location it can be very busy which is fine if your store is staffed appropriately. Depending on your pharmacy manager you can learn a great deal with potential to move up the ladder. The pay is low but the benefits are not bad and they will pay for you to take the pharmacy tech certification exam.
bad,"CVS has a great training program for all new employees. They seem to care about their employees being confident in their job skills. The core values of CVS are the foundation of the training program and customer service is key. It has been my experience however that hours are scarce and can be taken from you without any notice. Also, due to a high turn over rate in employees, it is difficult to learn or advance once you are placed into your permenant work environment."
bad,The managers  left all the time and the last one we had didnt know what she was doing and her best friend worked with us to so there was conflict of interest and the district manager didnt caire. She treated everyone that worked there like garage but never treated her best friend bad she got away with everything
bad,Worked for cvs for two months and got in trouble if I talked to the customers too long but was the only employee in seven years that received the heart award.  Pharmacist was rude to customers and prescriptions were never filled on time..
bad,"Everything is a process, no one takes ownership.  IT disconnected from the business.  No concern for employee satisfaction except for lip service."
bad,Typical day at work is a lot of downtime. Management doesn't discipline bad employees. The supervisor is incompetent and corrupt employees always get away with things. Company doesn't appreciate their employees. Very cheap considering they're making millions of $ of profit each year. Company only cares about their upper management people.
bad,"Management is not involved in the direct day to day work on the floor. This creates a gap in knowledge , the basic employee is left to learn from observing others that may or may not have been trained properly."
bad,Very nervous at first but I got the hang out of it. Learning how to stock and make sure everything was nice and neat. Greeting new customers. Making sure everything was up to date.
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,"Just don't work at CVS. It's barely better than Wal-Mart in terms of retail quality. There's so much red tape in hiring, transferring, promoting, HR, etc. that it's not worth it."
bad,stressful work environment. always short staffed and everyone is always stressed out. you dont have a life after work.
bad,"I am a current employee in Scottsdale - a non-retail position."
bad,"For the most part, my co-workers were terrific and friendly in my department. Management did their best with keeping us informed with multiple daily work process changes. Communication between the departments was extremely poor."
bad,I worked at a CVS in target and it was terrible. Since the change CVS employees at Target are not allowed to use the break room or anything associated with Target. Everything is disorganized and I'm also still waiting to be paid a month later. At this point I would say go anywhere but here.
bad,Working at CVS Health overall looks good on the resume and gives you good experience on customer service.  Each day will consist of taking at least 40 inbound calls and refilling prescriptions.  Representatives will have to get use to escalated situations that may occur once in a while.
bad,Manager is very lazy. had to do all of his work for him. he never worked his required 40hrs. he always had to leave the store and wold leave you there with no back up.
bad,Focusing on our customer service to strive for a better way to excide our excellent service for our customers. Ive helped bring our customer service scores up from a 50% up to an 85% in the last 6 months. Working side by side with the store manager to come up with new ways to teach our employees different way to communicate with our customers. Role play with our team.
bad,This company started out great .. they were just off of sanction.. however when working in a call with 90% women and 3% straight men .. the messiness was absurd ! The supervisors were even worse !!!! I wouldn't get close to anyone at this company.. just go in do your job and skedaddle !
bad,"it is good to have an experience for someone who just finished school. that is why I like CVS "
bad,"Management Structure and Advancement needs improvement"
bad,"While I only worked there part time, I bent over backwards for the company and I genuinely did love my job at first (mostly due to customers). I enjoy helping people, but not all employees do. Management overlooks the lazy employees and those who clearly do not want to be there because the entire company is so hard-out for employees that they cannot afford to lose one. No one notices the slack but the closers and actually dedicated employees will inevitably have to pick up the slack. Even when you take things up to HR nothing comes of it and nothing ever gets done. It brings the whole company down. The job itself is not demanding and the company tries to make employees feel valued by posting on a spinoff social media site about how great you are and giving you fake points to spend in a virtual store."
bad,It was very hard time. I don't like the work environment and all are from India and management as well.
bad,"Run don't walk away from the Minute clinic. Assembly line practice.   Management Interested in quantity not quality. Constant reminder of business finances and the need to see more patients, so you have to walk the store and invite patients in to the clinic and charge them for the visit on slow days. Patients are demanding, hostile & impatient. No flexibility with schedule. Work every other weekend. On call. Float to clinics one hour away with no travel reimbursement. Unrealistic expectations/task for your 10 hour day, your expected to: do it all. Fix kiosk when not functioning- which is often, control logs/expiration dates on test kits, follow visit phone calls, check labs, secretarial work, marketing in store, order inventory, restock inventory, mop floor, empty trash, make cash/ charge deposits and also by the way see patients! Corporate slavery stay away!"
bad,I did not like working in retail pharmacy. I did however like the pharmacy job title but the people there was not very helpful when you needed it.
bad,Mostly disorganized and unfocused management. Managers bribe with raises to try to keep you from leaving. Unpredictable hours. Terrible training procedures. Avoid this place.
bad,"You will always be short handed. its always a challenge to provide good service. Two people per shift most stores. A lot of the work will be shifted to management, but if you stay late to finish it you will be ridiculed. The pressure is really for you to work off the clock especially if your in management, but I just couldn't do it. You can't have a life, you get your schedule one week out the Friday or Saturday before your supposed to start, and its only a little bit better for the Store Manager.Turnover is high, and it takes a month to hire someone. I can say I met a lot of great people, that do work hard and try to do a good job."
bad,"The environment was good. The staff was supportive and encouraging to the employees. Not to familiar with the management, but was good while I was there."
bad,I worked in all aspects of the store including the pharmacy. I enjoyed my time in each position but received the most support from my pharmacist.
bad,"pretty much typical call center experience.....consider yourself lucky if you get a knowledgeable supervisor... they,re  ""Big"" on growth in the company however when interest is shown they blow it off...."
bad,"Good. fast paste, handle several position. Enjoy customer service. Their to work not to gossip or get involved with drama. I enjoyed all the all our customers."
bad,"I can go work at Arby's or Home Depot standing at a register and make 10.00/hour where I have no influence over the health/patient safety of lives etc. Or you can work for this company receive no performance based raises, only set raises once a year that everyone receives. No 401K, your pension you have to work there 5 years before you can do anything with and if you quit before 5 years you lose everything in it. Always short staffed, hardly ever recognition for job well done however plenty of criticism on what's wrong or what else needs done. Lead Tech quit several months ago and I have been voluntarily doing her tasks for the last couple months with no recognition/compensation. Pharmacy Manager was supposed to discuss a raise for me with the DM over a month ago and he has been in our store weekly for the last 4 weeks and still no discussion of a raise. They know I am looking for a new job!"
bad,"-reactive management team (not proactive at all)"
bad,would never work at this establishment again. Would not recommend to anyone. Always under staffed and never treated fairly. Management was horrible.
bad,"Lay off work ended."
bad,Cvs is a business that tries very hard to satisfy their customers.  In the pursuit of this they don’t treat their employees very well and they have some policies that in my opinion seem to invite problems into their employees but not the upper management.
bad,One is busy from beginning of the day until the end. Sometimes I would stay late to finish the days work. The coworkers were generally unhelpful and unpleasant.
bad,"Managers only care about numbers and not the employees. Favoritism is a large issue. Long time employees receive lots of freedom, while newer employees receive little training and consistent  and harsh critiques. Managers allow long time employees to do only the tasks they wish and push newer employees to pick up the slack, with little recognition or reward."
bad,"I worked in one of the DC's and the work itself is easy, but they time you in the picking and people with you will not help, they would rather jump ahead to the next wave, then you will get in trouble for slowing the line down. The money is decent, but you will never know when you will get off; don't trust them when they say you will be getting off every day at 3:30-- it won't happen, its more like between 5:30-9:00. If your looking a job with a lot of hours and that you live there more than your actual home then its the job for you."
bad,this was a temporary contract position through an employment agency.  Worked in the real estate department of the legal office.
bad,I have no Opinion about Omnicare at this time. I worked there for 8 years and when was my time to leave I left on good terms. As far as I am concerned anyone who goes and work for the Company or any other Company can form there own opinion.
bad,"Steady workday for filling prescriptions, monitoring inventory and expired medications. I learned to teach new hires and guide them into learning the CVS computer system and customer service. The hardest part of the job was managing the workload while regularly being understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the nice co-workers and customers that I had the honor of working with."
bad,"I worked for CVS Pharmacy for 11 years. During that time I had 7 different store managers and 3 different lead Pharmacists. The turn over for CVS is very high both in management and in lower levels of enjoyment. This is probably why you are constantly being assigned ""work modules"" to complete, sometimes without compensation. "
bad,Supervising and scheduling support staff and other pharmacist on the day to day running of the pharmacy store. Also served as a preceptor to encourage students on their journey of becoming a community pharmacist.
bad,"I have worked for many pharmacies but every since cvs took over its all about numbers, not patient care. They treat the employees like they are always expendable and if you are not a yes person, or disagree with the masses you will be terminated or worse. The turnover rate is high and room for growth is greatly exaggerated. Hard work never is  awarded here. They steal your ideas and never give you any kind of credit. Please be careful"
bad,"A typical day at work is go, moving from one task to the next before we get boggled down with patients.  I've learned that by starting on simple necessary day to day things as soon as I get to work and finishing them, I can then spend more time with patients and their needs.  If I need to call their doctor or their insurance or even try and explain what their insurance is trying to do for them.  The hardest part of the job is to explain why the insurance doesn't want to pay for something or why its so expensive, or why the doctor hasn't call for the patients refill yet.  The absolute best part of this job is being able to see the end result of a patent getting something they need within their budget, being able to help them find a cost saving product that neither their doctor or insurance communicated together to find. I like knowing I tried my best to help someone get something they need to take care of themselves."
bad,"The company expects more work to be done but keeps cutting employee hours. The district managers, supervisors, and regional managers only care about their numbers and not about the well being of those underneath them. Compensation to staff is unfair."
bad,Being in management not a lot of respect. Not good pay for as much as you are expected to do. Ok place to work as a customer assistant representative.
bad,"Horrible management, horrible coworkers, hated every part of working there. Management was the worst part, were very disrespectful, give me 1, ""4"" hour shift every 2 weeks."
bad,CVS employees could use a pay increase and more full time positions for non-management employees. A lot of training is required but is no actually used in OTJ stetting.
bad,The contract company that managed the qa resources were horrible. They worked us long hours including weekend and did not pay for overtime because we were contract 1099 resources.
bad,Fill approximately 250-300 prescriptions daily. Co Workers are very helpful. hardest part is towards end of the night when all orders have to be rushed and we encounter problems.
bad,"Co workers are great. Pay sucks. Hours and rotating shifts suck. Omnicare doesnt care about its employees.  No pay raises. No bonuses, not even a Christmas acknowledgment.  They only care about the numbers. Its a paycheck. ..not a big one...but if you are desperate for work then apply here. Training sucks, every body in my department was trained differently. High turnover rate because the company sucks. No reimbursement for CE or license renewal."
bad,I don't have one. I worked and went home. There is not much to tell about CVS. The people would stab you in the back if they have the chance.
bad,Being a pharmacy manager can shorten your lifespan 20 years.  This company expects the impossible.  Simply not the most coveted place to work.
bad,"It was good, I like long term care pharmacy. The pay is very bad and too much work. I would like to work in a similar pharmacy but I would want better benefits."
bad,"Fast Food Pharmacy is the easiest way to describe working for CVS, I spent 12 years with the company and over that time I had some wonderful managers, however they never stuck around...there are good people there but they are few and far between. The programs that the company promotes and pushes are designed to keep people taking drugs, never mind focusing on actually improving lives. And forget about having quality time to spend with patients which should be at the forefront of a pharmacy 1st company. Best part of the job was by far my co-workers. Unrealistic expectations, and red tape are plentiful at CVS."
bad,"Exhausting work but you get paid little more than you would at mcdonalds. Even as a NATIONALLY CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECH with 7 years with the company I am only making $14.50 an hour....doesn't seem right when Mcdonalds STARTS employees at $10/hour now. I guarantee this job is more stressful, and more demanding than flipping burgers. Just saying."
bad,"Management is horrible, poor communication from top levels down. Excellent customer service can not be provided due to extreme budget cuts. Over worked and understaffed. At risk for making serious drug errors due to lack of proper payroll and help. Many roadblocks and red tape. Not provided resources to be successful and get the job done efficiently and accurately."
bad,Not the best place at least in some Dc good pay lots of overtime during holiday season very stressful working at the warehouses poorly managed
bad,One of the worst companies to work for in America. ” Work/Life Balance. ... The computer system is not that great at CVS compared to other companies.
bad,"CVS claims to work as a team, but was not very helpful in training or  on day to day hours."
bad,this is not the best place to work. Managemnt sucks and does not have a great structure. even management does not know how to go over certain things. I would not recommend.
bad,Management is terrible and they treat their employees like garbage. I can say that I was able to learn a lot there and use it as a stepping stone to my next position.
bad,"The only thing good about working for CVS is the discount. 30% on CVS brand and 20% everything else. "
bad,"the best part of CVS Caremark is the location. It is located around several highways which makes the commute workable. The most enjoyable part of CVS is the ability to work from home, several departments this opportunity."
bad,work was typical pharmacy duties including customer service answering phones calling insurance companies and doctors offices
bad,Its ok. Its much like any other retail job  very busy with little down time.  Customer focused.  Average management focused more on numbers than employees or customer satisfaction.
bad,Its a nice place to work if you get along with co-workers. you stay busy most of the time. lots of customer service. management is ok. not much to say.
bad,"A typical day was checking out many customer prescriptions and sorting filled prescriptions alphabetically for pick up by customers."
bad,Recruiter is not honest about what the job entailed.  Job was more billing and figuring out measurements for infusion.  Job is not a good fit for someone who is math challenged.
bad,"had to work a lot of overtime with not a lot of pay for what you where required to do. Had to work weekends and holidays. most co-workers "
bad,Company had a great concept but was never influenced by management and others. A lot of general labor and assisting customers at the same time.
bad,The company only cares about the money. The team leads don't any work and look at you stupid when you need help. The pay is good but the hours suck. The system is fairly new so they are still working out the kinks. Not a great company to work for unless u need the money. They start you off at 15.00 an hour and offer overtime. Great health insurance! You might just hate working there but love the benefits.
bad,"If you are looking for fast money and long-term, temporary employment, Coram is ideal; however if you are looking to make a long-term career with advancements, Coram is not the company for you, at least in the Enteral Nutrition Center. This is a very high-stress, negative environment with lack of clear goals and objectives. Your day-to-day priorities are also unclear. The missing information in the Patient Intake Specialist position is that in addition to what has been listed, you will also be required to log into a phone queue in which you will be required to answer a high-volume of incoming phone calls that are routed to the intake department by calling the 800 number. You will also be required to be in ""on-call"" rotation meaning that you and your co-workers will rotate on a weekly basis for after hours phone calls. For 7 days, Monday through Monday, you will report to the office for your scheduled hours, and you will also take a cell phone and laptop home during your week. You will answer phone calls after the office closes until it re-opens each day, including holidays and weekends. This information is not discussed with you during the interview or job offer; I found out about it a couple months after starting the job. To speak to the unclear objectives, there are many ""top priorities"". You will be expected to ""drop everything and take care of"". These priorities make up your entire day making impossible to triage your work. These may include answering queue calls, working same day setups, responding to emails, taking direct phone calls to your extension, responding to instant"
bad,"A typical work day for me included coming in to work around 4pm and working 5hrs. So basically until 9pm. Sad to say I was hired by the store manager who told me I would make a certain amount then on my first day switched it to a lower amount but I was so desperate (straight out of school) for my first job in Pharmacy. I had turned down a job at Walgreens (making more) because I was told one thing at CVS then turned out to be another. Sad to say I should have known better. I started out as full time then because of all of the economy issues... many had their hours cut. I was one of them. When I did arrive at work... work would often be crazy! Filled with customers lined up waiting to get their prescriptions filled. That little time I was scheduled would sometimes turn into a little more but not overtime since I was turned into a part-time. That little time I was there was hectic! Although the atmosphere was a bit crazy at times, I did learn how to balance conversations in between work. I didn't want the line piling up."
bad,"This companies requires a single person to do more than what they give them You never have help, they don't acknowledge hard work or dedication. You will work extremely hard. Your day starts with moving inventory and ends with processing the end of day work. NOT worth what they pay"
bad,"very fast paced environment, no downtime, breaks were hard to come by, very rarely was there time for lunch breaks. range of ages. currently no employees are there from the time I worked there."
bad,"busy, fun, customers can be difficult and challenging to deal with. I've learned what drugs are used for. The most enjoyable part is helping a customer and hearing him/her say ""thank you."""
bad,"Omnicare is a fast paced job. The hardest part of the job is learning that not all employees are expected to follow the rules. Bullying was not only the norm, but also ignored by management. They are always shorthanded, so employees are required to work through break times, and often long after their shift has ended. The healthcare benefits are excellent."
bad,"The environment at CVS Pharmacy is equivalent to what I imagine ""the opposite of Heaven"" to be.  It is literally chaos at times, and if you think there is a slight chance of sufficient patient counseling time, you are living a lie.  The pharmacist has NO time and the patients rarely ever have any time. So I guess if you live a rushed, hectic lifestyle, this pharmacy is a perfect match! But in terms of a lifelong career, this place will burn you out - and burn you out FAST!  I worked here for over two years, and it took a complete store transfer and for me to complete over 100 actual IPPE hours to ever finally learn Drop Off. The politics between workers are horrible and the constant gossip and cattiness are worse than a high school. Make that worse than a high school movie.  If you like to keep your work and social life separate, then this is not the work place for you. My favorite part of the day was dealing with customers.  I NEVER had a bad experience with a customer, and that's the 100% honest truth. Coworkers on the other hand.....I was a pharmacy intern. My 1st day when I was wearing my plain white coat I was treated kindly. The 2nd day when I had on the school's white coat with their embossed emblem - it was like they were different people.  Or rather, like they thought I had turned into someone else. If you take anything other than your allotted 30 minute break, you will be hated for eternity."
bad,I like working at Coram its nice place to work co-worker are nice. you can learn a lot about the patients and help them well there are sick.
bad,"This was a boring position, I felt like I wanted to do more to stay busy, but it is a small store. The pay was not the best compared to hours worked."
bad,too much training and stress for such little pay. the CVS corporation is way too large to not pay their employees more money.
bad,"I honestly don't know how anyone could work for this company long term, That is probably why it takes so long for benefits to kick in, Turnover is high, everyone is miserable. It is nearly impossible to get anyone to cover your shift because most stores are purposefully short staffed with no overtime allowed. No work/life balance to speak of. The company says it's trying to change and focus on patient health, but in reality, it's always going to be about the money. As a result employees are being pulled in too many directions, resulting in both physical and emotional stress."
bad,No job security and the management is awful. Forced overtime and no consideration towards the worker at all. Bad place to work
bad,The Company only offers average to low end compensation packages. For a health care organization they should be absolutely embarrassed by the high deductible health plans they offer. I have never worked for a company that cares less about it's employees.
bad,CVS does not value employees. Their main concern is to increase store profit and by doing so they tend to reduce employee salaries as much as they can.
bad,"The work is fulfilling, and I feel like I am utilizing my knowledge greatly as a doctor of pharmacy. It is certainly much more satisfying work than being a retail pharmacist. There is little drama, and co-workers are friendly and open. I spend the whole work day sitting at a desk looking at a computer screen, and I have to make and receive a lot of phone calls. The job definitely requires knowledge and skill with computer programs. I learned more than I could imagine about how insurance prior authorizations and exceptions and appeals work."
bad,"Call center environment, answering call calls providers and patients regarding prescriptions. Questions include billing, payments, and shipping etc."
bad,The management doesn't care about their employees at all and they make everything way harder than it should be. Nickname for CVS would be CVStress. You are disposable here.
bad,Management is not flexable with you at all. un realistic goals for people. Management plays favorites all the time. Pay stinks as well
bad,"During the recruiting process, the the recruiters used from staffing agencies are misleading with job details and day to day workflow."
bad,This company does a great job of sucking out all energy one has.  It also does not give their employees opportunities to move up in the company; thus they ahve to leave to move up.
bad,"The job can be stressful or boring, i have not felt that it was a rewarding job though. there is a lot of work to do for so little pay."
bad,It was a good job for the moment but not long term. I was there for a few years and didn't really get a raise or promotion. The management plays favors. Not a good place and I would never go back.
bad,"A typical day will involve two people. One person running the register, and the other person, whom is some sort of manager will do daily tasks to help stock the shelves and help customers. Sometimes there will be a third person, which is the store manager. it has a strong skeleton crew feel."
bad,Working in a pharmacy will give you a lot of important life lessons as in how to deal with a wide range of customers and employers. But CVS pharmacy is not a company you want to work for in the long term unless you are pharmacist in training or want to work in corp.
bad,"It is an okay learning environment, unfortunately once people get in, they just seem to stay there. When the job is done wrong, the newbie is always blamed. not a good place for those who dont like stress."
bad,"I was hired as a temp and asked for feedback weekly. Was let go without warning. "
bad,"	Manages a team of four employees in the photo department"
bad,"I have worked for this company for three years and I enjoy the type of work, but the salary is hard to accept.  Currently my co-workers are awesome.  With this type of salary it is hard to feel valued as an employed."
bad,"Working at CVS can be a thrill at times. It can be enjoyable as the work is team oriented. I find that it is hard though with the company trimming hours, that you have to do tasks that normally two or three people would have done 10 years ago, by yourself. Management can be decent depending on the situation. Yet advancement feels ultimately impossible. When someone is looking to move forward, managers are trying to hold employees back because they need them at their current positions and do not want to replace them. Especially when getting into the assistant management role or higher. I've seen more external candidates that don't know what they are doing as Assistant managers, than internal candidates that have 5 or more experience that do know what they are doing. A typical day involves a cashier up front running a register and a manager of some sort doing tasks like putting out stock, using telxons to scan merchandise, and handle transactions that require excess change to be transported. I feel that I learned how to work with customers and their various problems, while maintaining a steady hand for theives and crooks whom try to bend the rules to their favor. Not that everyone is one, but sometimes accidents happen and employees have to remain vigilant in correcting them in a honest and non threatening manor."
bad,"High work load demanded. Not enough staff"
bad,"overall i loved working with my most recent employer. however when it came down to accuracy and patient care they tell us the patient comes first but in all honesty its only about numbers and salaries."
bad,"7-5"
bad,"get very hectic, pay is not worth the amount of work you do, they over work you."
bad,"A typical day at work is to wait on my customers in a timely manner.   At CVS Pharmacy I was able to professional develop my knowledge of the brand and generic drugs. CVS Health you must always have leadership, organization, and teamwork, because these are the key skills needed to keep the patients happy and to have a successful pharmacy.I am also a people friendly person and I love my job. I also do my job with pride. I also can get alone with anybody."
bad,CVS Health has zero work life balance and under pays its employees. The work load is unrealistic and internal partnering is non-existent.
bad,No quality of life when you work for CVS as a pharmacist.  There isn't enough time in the day to do everything they expect you to do in 24 hours.  And all those metrics.
bad,I refilled members prescriptions and enrolled the members into silver script medicare insurance.
bad,"Data entry, make some phone call to doctor office to vertify prescriptions, calling insurance companies to get rides for medications. Adhereance calls to the patient to make sure they are taking there medications on time or to see if they're medication on time."
bad,I enjoyed working there because we had flexible schedules but I disliked working there because some Supervisors did not know what they were doing and would provide false information when assisting other employees. I would constantly have callers compliment me on the excellent customer service that I provided but I was fired because of one bad call that I had a complaint. I had never been written up before and was always on time for work. They did not even take this into consideration.
bad,they Lied about the hours. I was hired for part time told at least 20-25 hours a week and found myself barely getting 12 a week. I was told Since I had my certification and MA registration I would get 2 more for each and hour they never told me it was in fact 0.02%.
bad,"Starting the day off with shortened hours and same work expectation"
bad,"You will do better off working for another company"
bad,The most satisfying part of working at CVS is making the customers happy and wanting to come back. The environment was not a good place to work in and it was no security there at all to feel safe.
bad,Job balance and lack of staffing is a signifcant contributor to low qulaity of life while working at Omnicare
bad,work is very fast paced. you answer calls all day.no room for growth.
bad,"CVS allows only a certain amount of advancement, and once the highest advancement is reached, the pay increases are very minimal (about 2-3% raises yearly).  The work environment is stressful because of understaffing, and employees are required to do more work than they should have to in these circumstances.  Good employees are recognized for good work, but so are bad employees."
bad,my first cashier job was a good experince and all the duties was my very first experience but I enjoyed the opportunity to learn and expand on new skills
bad,"Very fast paced work environment. Can be very rewarding ."
bad,"Problems with the hours all the time"
bad,This job was a good job. It was the busiest store in entire Ventura county. I was hands on with every station which cvs had from the drop off window to the inventory of the medications.
bad,Unable to advance. Other companies in the same field have better benefits and job outlook.
bad,"The corporate retail mentality applied to the health care industry seems like a bad idea.  Working for CVS really reinforced this notion.  Management was sub-par.  The scheduling was inadequate for everyone involved.  Management did not take responsibility for own actions and did not lead by example.  Management's ethical practices were due to pressure from those above them and was questionable.  When I went the extra mile to satisfy customers, they praised me while continuing to criticize the company.  I felt uncomfortable working for the company. "
bad,Job requirements changed daily depending on project tasks. Not the same work every day.
bad,One of the worst places I worked. Long hard hours and no balance of life/
bad,I assisted in the credentialing of Nurse Assistants for Minute Clinic
bad,This was a temporary position only.  Too far to drive for too little pay.
bad,"I absolutely loved the training process for CVS Caremark. It made me feel safe knowing that they took the time to provide all that training. When I started working at the store that I originally applied for I began to rethink my career choice. Every day it became scarier and scarier to walk into work. I was afraid to ask questions because the lead tech, some of the technicians, and even one of the pharmacist will roll their eyes and get bothered when I needed help. Especially if  I interrupted a conversation they were having about what they did over the weekend. One day a particuliar pharmacist will be telling me how awesome I was and how happy she was to have me on the team, and the next day she's scowling at everything I do. My smile began fading day by day working there."
bad,"this pharmacy was dirty, there was no leadership, a lot of favoritism, very unorganized"
bad,"as a Senior Representative, I perform different roles as a rep. I take escalations and assist with questions from reps. I enter data into the computer. I conduct side-by-side, coachings."
bad,The job I currently do is rewarding. The hours that keep changing is not so rewarding
bad,poor training and more focus on up-selling customers than reducing medication errors
bad,"No matter how hard you work and how good you are, NOBODY CARES! Management is always pushing you to go above and beyond but never deliver on any of their promises. If your promised a raise, forget it. Managers do mess with your time to make themselves look good. They rather you stay and work off the clock than pay you to stay and fix the mess they allowed to accumulate all day. They will pull you in with lies that you will still expect to happen months-years later."
bad,"Everyday provides new challenges. No support from the company, inadequate compensation."
bad,"Pharmacy Tech."
bad,Employment at CVS was a rather unpleasant experience. This is a big company with little or no interaction with it's employees. Wages are low and hours are sparse.
bad,Typical day is busy. You can get hit with quite a few customers at one time and not happy if they have to wait more than 10-15 minutes. We can seem to be shorthanded at times because it is hard to tell when that will happen. Hardest part is trying to help 5 people at once and also the phone. There is also a lot of behind the scenes phone calls and paperwork to be done daily. The most enjoyable is the customers that really appreciate all you do for them and my co-workers. We all work together and help one another.
bad,"Typical work day consist of greeting customers, front facing store and assist customers on the phone.During my time at CVS Pharmacy I've learned to go that extra mile to make my customers happy. I get alone with all my co-workers they forward to me coming in to work when scheduled. Hardest part of my job is nothing i manage myself through all that comes before me. Most enjoyable part of my job is when my customers come in after hearing me greet them, they smile and say, WE LOOK FORWARD COMING TO THE STORE JUST TO HEAR MY FRIENDLY CARING VOICE. When I'm not there the store isn't the same. That makes me feel warm inside, I'm appreciated."
bad,a typical day is standing at the register for 8 hours if your a cashier while supervisiors do whatever they want avoiding human contact.
bad,"CVS, I believe, isn't practical or flexible with their employees. There's no team at CVS amoungst co-workers. There's no common goals. Affirmation for job well done is few and far between, from mangement or fellow co-workers."
bad,I'm not looking for retail pharmacy. The hardest part of my job was not ever having enough help!!!! Customer wait time was terrible and I'm the type that I want to be able to help customers in a timely manner. Alot of customers are sick and they dont want to wait forever in the pharmacy. I liked helping and saving the customer money if they didn't have health insurance. I learned a lot from working there 5 years. I'm good at inputting ins. cards and typing scripts in and multi tasking
bad,"If your a pharmacy tech and need a job, this place pays the bills. Poor management and over worked and underpaid."
bad,"Results mean nothing to get ahead. Half of upper management have no degrees and worked in warehouse. They rake you, break you then fire you. Third party leader is a loser and so are the directors!! I am a billler. skippy.uhl are awesome!"
bad,I learned a lot about insurance and policies. But it is very fast pace and they are not willing to teach more than is necessary.
bad,"A typical day at work is making sure that at the end of the day you make sure that you give the customers what they want. If it wasn't for my co-workers my job would be harder than what it is. The hardest part of my job right now is dealing with a short staffed and having to do more than one thing to find out that no matter what the customer isn't satisfied with the result. The most enjoyable part of my job is "
bad,"CVS is the worst company I have ever worked for. They do not treat their employees very well as far as pay and benefits. I did meet some co workers who I liked and enjoyed working with but, for the most part everyone was very un happy and was more concerned with everyone else's business than there own.  About the only thing I learned is my skills and knowledge in Pharmacy."
bad,"A typical day at CVS would be okay the customers used to brighten my day. I learned to keep my mouth close around certain people(such as co-workers) just speak & keep doing your job. My co-workers was nice people but two faced. Their wasn't nothing hard about the job, but trying to run the register, assist customers, & trying to watch shoplifters at the same time when you have other co-workers who was there & seen the shoplifters & would blame me. The most enjoyable part the job was seeing the customers, helping assisting them finding what they needed."
bad,"From day one they would lose track of my training information, putting me behind as far as being productive and learning on the job skills."
bad,"i worked here what feels like my entire life, i started here when i was young and didnt leave till i was in my late 20s. i grew up with this company because it was the reason i moved to Arizona in the first place. i enjoyed getting to know my customers on a one on one level and helping them by suggesting things they used already with our store brand. alot of customers grow to love you over the years and i know when i left the company my influence seemed to loose over the customers that claimed that i was their favorite cashier. i had some enjoyable co workers over the years some i miss terribly. some not so much."
bad,"it was good place to work, but , I lost my full time position and my benefits, so I ahd to look for a better job."
bad,Always be prepared to come and work in a fast paced environment. You will always have a productive day at Cvs. Being able to muti-task is a must !!! Everyday you learn something new from new drugs on the market or an unexpected drug recall. A day of work consist of alot of socializing with your co workers and our patients and doctors and insurance companies.
bad,"Again, not much communication, basically one is left to perform duties on their own, not a comfortable atmosphere."
bad,"Management needs improvement, they kept changing managers like it was nothing."
bad,"A typical day at work for me consist of the following:"
bad,"When I first started this job is was an ok place to work with steady hours. Then as the holidays approached we had to start working long hours unexpectedly and making up days that we had off for the holiday. I did not like that because I have obligations when I get off work and was not able to fulfill them, Eventually I had to quit because they would no longer accommodate my part-time schedule. "
bad,"PTCB Certified, providing quality customer service, processing and submitting insurance claims, entering patient and order profiles, handling prior authorizations, answering phones/faxes, using Microsoft and Linux, reading and translating SIG codes, HIPPA laws and violations, compounding/Reconstituting, counting and preparing prescription orders, Inventory specialist, scheduling technicians for proper workflow, medical Terminology, basic anatomy and physiology knowledge, name brand/generic comparisons. "
bad,"I worked for the PBM business of CVS Caremark for just under one year, despite what I felt was a darn good pay and benefits package. I was mentally and physically exhausted from losing 50%+ of my nights and weekends and enduring a completely hostile IT management environment. My team was 33% to 50% of the size needed to meet the workload, audit, and regulatory requirements and expectations placed upon us. I like to stay busy, but I did not enjoy being set up to fail. I also felt that the organization moved too hastily, to the point of sloppiness, in providing IT solutions to our internal customers. I am certain it is only a matter of time before a major data loss or other compromising event occurs and makes the news. "
bad,it was fun place to work for but the old pharmacist was mean.  he did not like younger people
bad,"Exposure to pharmacy management, mtm implementation. Difficult to find work/life balance"
bad,Job is not hard but the management pick and choose when to follow policies and who to use them on.
bad,"clock in, go to your assigned work area,stock any supplies you would need ,take an order from production line scan the order verify that its correct pack and then ship it.I have learned how to process customers orders,destroy confidential information if there is an exception to the order or if it printed wrong.I learned the importance of hippa regulations and violations.We rarley see manager unless there is a meeting,an error in your work,or your rate was low. We could also ask our lead to have them come speak to us.Coworkers most of them are great to work with.The hardest part of job is standing at your work station with only being able to pickup order and putting back on line when complete your neck, legs and feet get stiff and hurt from not much body movement.The most enjoyable part of the job was providing the customer there order in a timely manner and leaving at the end of the day."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to come in at 10 p.m. Check out customers at the register and also begin my duties for the night, which are usually listed on a clipboard every night. Typically I clean up the store restock the merchandise and make the store look presentable for the next day. I learned a lot more about customer service and how to make a better experience for the customers. The management in my store is motivational and nice, but that changes often because the employees are transferred often it is a different experience with each one. My coworkers are all team players and respectful. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that I work overnight. It is very hard to adjust. The part of my job I enjoy the most is getting to know my coworkers and the customers, that is what keeps my job from being dull and boring."
bad,"The store company needs major change within the company. The Managers and Pharmacy Managers need to be re-looked at, and the higher ups need to understand what is really going on behind the scenes."
bad,"CVS Pharmacy does not care about your personal well being. If you are out sick they make it seem like it is a bother to them. I was out 4 days with a doctors note for Strep Throat and Bronchitis (2 days was in the hospital), I was written up(per district manager) because at most you can only miss 2 days, I explained to them I was in the hospital and it didn't matter. Also, because of this illness I was passed up on a promotion because the District supervisor didn't think I was ""Healthy enough"" to take on the role as lead Pharmacy tech, even though those 4 days were the only days I had missed in over a year of being with the company. Lack of leadership and management is a complete joke NO MATTER who you talk to they just back up other managers and not the people out in the for front."
bad,"this is where i learned my organizational skills that i use to this day in case management. I loved working there, but there wasn't enough advancement opportunities."
bad,"Before I get into my review, I must state alot of people who are posting saying they like their job are posting that they work in retail. Caremark is not retail, it is mail order. Its a factory. Plain and simple."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of filling perscriptions, greeting customers, ringing people up on the cash register, restocking the shelves and a constant interaction with customers.I have learned third-party billing,how to deal with some unhappy customers in an appropiate way and how to keep up in a fast paced environment. Management was very nice to its employees and took care of us. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was actually running the drive-thru part of the pharmacy. The best part of the job was the expirence I had while I was there. The customers and the co-workers made it worth working there."
bad,I just do not feel that CVS cares much about people's lives outside of the work place. Its all work then go home. Barely paid. Changing schedules at the drop of a hat. Very inconsiderate (at least at my store). Management looks and acts unprofessional.
bad,Very mentally demanding position.
bad,"Great mission statements, goals, and plans to develop management associate relations."
bad,good place to start getting the experience and to get certified but once completed not worth the stress. Not enough hours and not enough help.
bad,"High turnover; professional workers benefits dwindled to match store (hourly) employee benefits. Compensation is approximately $25,000 under market value for position held; management made it difficult to move within the company; great internal diversity groups that meet regularly"
bad,I learned more about the different types of insurances and what they had to offer for people
bad,I worked full time and full time in college. I learn the value of working in a big company and the ability to move up in the company. I wish I did less labor work. Management did not want to help the team. I'm surprised I wasn't paid enough.
bad,"Customer Service Pharmacy TechnicianAssisted Pharmacist with in bound and out bound transfers. Pill id.'s,verified written dates on prescriptions as well as written quantity's,Data Entry. I received several awards for exceptional customer service skills. Hardest part of the job was trying to provide good customer service while trying to keep your time short on the phone."
bad,Ok job for Someone looking to work to pay tuition
bad,"iliked working for FD,learned alot. did not like the long hours and did not feel appreciated"
bad,"Working at Cvs was very challenging, its a call centre with 3 or 4 diffrent companies located in the centre."
bad,Often understaffed.
bad,"The job is simple but you have to concentrate in what you're doing at all times.. You cant make a mistake.. If you make a mistake when mixing or counting medicine, Is a life treating."
bad,not a very a good place to work for the managment was poor and so was the workers
bad,"This a job that doesnt have fun in it ,never had to try and fun on a job.no lunch breaks somtimes had to try and eat while working thats sometimes is not any fun."
bad,I personally Did not like working for this company. I feel they don't really care about you or your family.
bad,"Honestly, had the best manager there is, but upper management is horrible & not what it seems like in orientation go figure..very unorganized once you start & they expect so much from you without any benefits, most people have family in or kiss butt BIG time, they expect the same from you, hired on temps make 14 doing the exact job you do at 11, hardly any room to move up unless you plan on INVESTING YOUR LIFE, totally not worth it, a good part time for the college student or the bored retired person, that’s it"
bad,unfortunately that I can see with out my efforts this place would fall apart I get little to no positive feed back for going above and beyond every day which is why I am comfortable with my pay and benefits I am looking for something new and challenging were my efforts don't go unnoticed
bad,I really like working for this company but everyone is not treated fairly. Low hours so you really don't get paid very much. Favoritism is shown to certain people of a different race.
bad,The team is very poor at making sure you feel at home. They don't listen to your concerns or thoughts. Also they will mess with your schedule whenever they feel like.
bad,This place has been going down hill for sometime now when i first started thought i would be there for at least 5 2 years in just too many changes they dont care bout yo outside life just what please them
bad,"This company needs to allow employees to grow with the company by considering the educational level of each employee, and the willingness to grow. Thank you."
bad,"this place was always busy and never really had any downtime. I worked long hours, sometimes no breaks. Was very strict with sick call outs, lateness for any reason."
bad,Fast paced 24hr store I have been given alot of responsibilities as a part time worker for 2+ years would like full time plus hours have been cut recently for technicians
bad,"This was my first job, it was good that it got me in the door to employment. There was no training, it was all learn as you go (which was not fun). If you aren't good with customers, then you may want to pass."
bad,If you struggle with multitasking and time mgnt its not the place to work. Priorities are placed on things that will have no impact with customers. Company promotes one thing but their actions contradict their message.
bad,"The longer I work here the more I realize that CVS will take and take from you until you feel like there is nothing more to give, all the while making you hate your job... The pay is nothing special, there is no appreciation when things are going good in the pharmacy because of course there is always something to nit pick, annual raises are not great (like in the cents most the time), and hours get cut and cut until there is complete chaos, The only saving grace are the genuinely kind people I work with."
bad,very busy work environment. customers are demanding. no teamwork. the Pharmacy Manager are rude all the time. She will yell at you in front of the customers. Good she no longer connected at CVS.
bad,"If you enjoy being ran until you have nothing left and continually getting yelled at then this is the perfect job area for you. All they care about is numbers, making sure the company is making the most possible money, they don’t care about their employees or getting the customer the best help"
bad,"The areas where this company lacks the most are compensation & benefits, culure and morale. The turnover is extremely high and most people are unhappy in their roles. I've never worked for a company where people only last weeks or months before they split. Most people don't even give 2 week's notice. They simply don't return! Avoid applying here if you can."
bad,you get to meet great people. Patient's are great and you really feel on a personal level with them. Nice to know patient's enjoy being helped by you and know you on a first name basis.
bad,"Other than the paycheck I didn't enjoy anything at my job and that was the underlying feeling of almost all my fellow employees. Pharmacist's job is stressful and I knew that when I accepted the position more than 25 years ago. But, of late, working at CVS had become, at best, a drudgery and at worst a torture. Management puts layers and layers of responsibilities on you, makes you sign on all kinds of rules, regulations, policies and agreements, jump through the hoops and get the job done by the end of the day and deliver the service with a smile. Nothing short of bend over backwards, walk on the water and fly in the air. If a pharmacist shortcuts a policy in order to get the job done the management is quick to point out that they attended the ""module"" that covered that same policy in detail and therefore he or she is entirely and solely responsible for the outcome. Except, when you attend the on-line module, dozens of patients aren't waiting gawking at you, phones aren't ringing and you are not juggling a dozen balls including ringing on the register because you are short of help. I absolutely adored this job when I first started more than 25 years ago but for the last five to ten years I was working only for the pay check. So, when I realized that I no longer needed that pay check I retired to maintain my sanity, even though it was a few years before my retirement age. I truly feel sorry for the new pharmacy grads."
bad,"I enjoyed my customers and my team however you do not get training hours and are expected to train people for free. Managers are based on 45 hours but since you are salary then you work 60-70 plus hours to keep up wit the workload. Benefits were reasonable as far as copay's but I felt we paid a lot out of pocket for insurance. Upper management changed a lot and each manager was different. The work culture was great they felt like family but I never got to see my real family. The hardest part of the job was balancing home and work life. Too many tasks and not enough time to get it all done. I learned how to manage people, problem solve, communicate, how to treat others and not treat others."
bad,Cashiering in the pharmacy is constantly busy and overwhelming. Management constantly under-schedules staff every week on certain days that make working those days a living nightmare. You're more than likely to encounter a bad experience with a self-entitled customer with unrealistically high expectations. Your opinion about how things should change in the store are immediately brushed aside.
bad,"I worked there for 4 years, and the last year or so have been awful. The company cuts weekly hours all the time, until you don’t even get your full time hours, then expect you to go to another store to find hrs( which NO ONE HAS HOURS) I was full time, but working 20-30 hrs a week. My store was awesome,  it the company sucks, they don’t care about you, they care about money."
bad,"You will quickly learn to adapt to a high turnover environment. Long hours are guaranteed depending on the amount of hours a store is allotted as well as the condition of the store. "
bad,"It started off great but management and respect got poor. The hours were great, communication could’ve been better. The respect for cashiers are very low though."
bad,This job is a very stressful place to work. Cvs will get rid of you in a heartbeat and not think twice about it. Its dirty and the managers are lazy. The pay is ok as a second income for a household. The good part about cvs is that there is a ton ok work and you never have to worry about being laid off. You also get alot off paid time off and 30% of CVS products.
bad,"At least in my district, It was impossible to advance into the SMIT program.  "
bad,the hours are very flexible and its a good place to start. If you are looking for a full time job this is not the place. Most pharmacies are understaffed and busy. Yet for some reason hardly any one get 40 hours a week or benefits.
bad,I loved my team and customers but one cannot perform their job if not given the necessary resources. It's extremely hard to be motivated to work for a company that continues to show you day after day that you mean nothing to them.
bad,"Expectations exceed abilities. Senior management did not believe in developing and advancing present talent nor replacing talent that was lost. Workloads were never balanced, and there was poor workforce management. Morale was low. Little to no incentives to build team efforts."
bad,If you are a cashier they will expect you to complete your long list of tasks all while being their first ringer and its lots of walking back and forth and frustration. The hardest part of the job is learning all the small details and remembering them.
bad,"I've never had a job before where my performance and every decision I made was under a microscope. If you enjoy being micromanaged this is the perfect position for you. The position is salaried and you're told as long as you work 8 hours you're ok. The catch is, there is never time to finish your work in 8 hours. There's a ridiculous call quota that must be met weekly, plus other metrics that are impossible to meet. This job is definitely NOT worth the pay. The people are nice (strange hierarchy system going on), but friendly in a weird Pleasantville type of way. I left this job and will never look back."
bad,"My contract was terminated without notice or warning. At almost 6 months, I was called at 9:30 pm on a Friday and told CVS had terminated my contract and I am not to contact any of the managers.  I worked an 8 hour shift that day. 2 days earlier I was moved to a new team and told everyone on this team was chosen because they had heard nothing but good things about us. I was never told there was any problem with my work.  This came as a complete surprise and I feel betrayed."
bad,"Very selfish corporation. Very.minimal concern for how their business decisions affect associates whe rely on hours to make a living.  Customers' needs seem to.be secondary, regardless of claims to the contrary in ads.  If all you have in mind is being chained to.the register and receiving unrealistic expectations for stocking and refreshing with minimalistic staffing then you will thrive here"
bad,"My first manager was awesome amd very knowledgeable.  He was helpful and wanted to help his employees advance."
bad,"Pay at CVS is pretty fair since they drastically raised their pay rates in 2018. Health insurance is only offered to full-time employees. The deductibles and premiums are so high that the insurance is only a good deal if you have a major hospitalization. "
bad,The job itself is not bad. You work with to many people who refuse to go fast and it is a very fast pace job therefore you go from what should be an 8 hr day to a 12 to 12.5 hour day because of your co workers. Managment does not care about you unless your deathly hurt or something gets damaged. Good job but you work with children and its ran like a school. You cant hurt anyone's feelings.
bad,"My biggest problem working here was the fact that nobody had the backs of the employees.  It was pretty much the Admissions staff versus the Sales Team, and we always lost, even when we were right."
bad,"Everything is an immediate priority, and after working long days sometimes until 6, 7, or 8 at night, the managers will decide it's no longer needed.  Even worse is when reports were provided, they didn't like what the data showed, and decided to go their own way anyways."
bad,system used is old DOS based. very cumbersome to use. not very organized. management expected a lot from workers. heavy work load. lots of paper work.
bad,It’s all based on #s they didn’t care about their quality of customer service anymore. It’s gone down hill fast. Several colleagues are ready to leave after years of loyalty. Don’t care about their works b/c they short staff both pharmacy and front store several times a week. Time bomb of stress because lace of ppl and causing burn out
bad,"Toxic environment. Most people are hire on just because they need people. Half done work that deal with people life's and health. "
bad,The company used to care about employees and patients. Now they only care about numbers and bottom lines... Money in their pocket. Cut full time employees from 40 hours to 30 when it gets slow which effects employees paying their own bills as well as customer care. We cannot take care of the patients coming in. It is honestly sad after 8 years of service looking for a new job.
bad,You can pour your heart and soul in what you do and it goes unseen... I had a DM tell me I either take the job now or I take it later even though I did not want to run that location. The pay is not equal to men and women even if you have been with the company longer than most. I feel very torn because I do everything full heartedly and it gets taken advantaged of and there is too many broken promises because of the turn over there is...
bad,Never enough tech hours and no meal or restroom breaks.  Stressful chaotic environment with no compassion or caring from management. Constant berating by customers to staff members.  Not a very pleasant working environment.
bad,"I regret every applying for a job as a technician in the pharmacy. I was told I would be working 40 hours a week....I haven't work that many hours ever per week and I've been with the company almost two years. The only time I got close to working that many hours is if I traveled to other stores in the surrounding cities. There was once when I was compensated for my mileage/gas. Other than that no other location offered to compensate me for my travel. You never get your mandated breaks unless you're for sure working 6+ hours, then you get your thirty minute lunch...which is never enough time to thoroughly enjoy your meal because of how stress it is to work there. Almost every location is understaffed...you will get constant complaints from patients and all you can say is ""sorry, its not me or my manager that wants it this way, its the company"" and it doesn't even make sense.  I rarely get my schedule out three weeks ahead. I'm never working the same shifts, so it is very inconsistent. It's definitely not worth the pay for the amount technicians actually do. I definitely feel like technicians put in more work in running the pharmacy than the actual pharmacists. If you're not going to pharmacy school to get your degree, don't work here."
bad,I found this job boring. I always felt that I was wasting my life away working in retail. I think that the employees aren't paid enough to survive on their own and that the experience doesn't open any new doors for career advancement.
bad,They offered management position for .25 cents more than i knew it was time for me to leave . I was already basically doing the the job of a manager and you want me to to even more work for just 25 cents . They don't take care of there employees.
bad,"Management was not good, at all. That's not to say the manager wasn't nice; it was just that she was disorganized and often took advantage of the employees who were willing to help."
bad,"You are given task to complete with little time or help to complete assigned tasks ,  you have to be good at time management  to complete tasks ,  also hard to balance life and work,  lack of support from upper management."
bad,Corporate policies did not care about employee needs. There was no advance education and no time to learn a new skill nor was there anyone available to help you learn or willing to train.  There are never enough workers to assist patients even though we had the highest number of patients coming to the pharmacy in the area.
bad,"If you are in management and have a family DONT DO IT !! The pay isnt terrible but there is zero work life balance and the company really doesnt care how many hours you work to achieve the level of work they give you.  You will receive very little support from management in the way of payroll as they bonus on your back because of district payroll number targets.  It's the easy way offset the lack of sales and profitability of the district as a whole yet still bonus yearly.  Expect long days, heavy workloads, and missed family activities."
bad,"Don’t be the new person. I have been given all the closing shifts. I’m a manager and I spend more time behind the counter than the cashiers. We lost 2 cashiers and the have not been replaced. I also run a department and I never get to be in it because I’m cashiering. I have not been trained to be a manager since I got there, I just get sent to be a cashier"
bad,Cvs is not a bad starting job but not a place to stay long term. They do not allow for movement up and the environment you work in is extremely inconsistent. Management seems to care only about themselves and not their team members.
bad,"No management direction and treated just as a body to take phone calls. Managers lack basic leadership skills and no employee engagement. Love working with patients, however, poor management results in extremely high turnover."
bad,As a new technician o found it hard to ask questions because it stressed out my team members when customers volume was at its highest I. The store. I hated to ask questions because they couldn’t help at that time. I had two in class training and one OJT training and was then in the work flow.
bad,This place gives you hours but also no room for advancement boring and just feels like you not getting anywhere with this company  corporate Doesn’t care about employees if a shoplifter attacks you and you try to defend yourself they fire you staff always starting drama with each other but then act friendly when they see each other
bad,"A typical day of work consists of receiving referrals throughout the day. Loading new pt's into the system and calling pt's to go over insurance benefits and pt copays. Notating every event that goes on with the referral being processed and communicating with internal co workers on the status of each referral. Alot of the times you are slammed with a heavy workload with little to no help from my co workers. I would say that this company expects too much from one person. It's as if you're being over worked. The amount of work that your required to do isn't feasible. Training at this place is a joke. They have you sitting with different departments for weeks at a time doing roles that DO NOT reflect the work that you are responsible for doing. There's also a LOT of favoritism that goes on here. I WOULDN'T recommend working for this company at all. It's a good way to gain the experience but that's all. Gain your experience and RUN. Also, pay raises at this job are garbage and not worth it for the amount of stress that you are dealing with. I received a pay raise under .30 cents and won't get another raise for another year."
bad,The jobs that were required of me was to restock the shelves and re align products on the store shelves. Once in a while I would be tasked with the duty of reorganizing shelves. Overall the job is really slow because so much has to be done in a small section of the store before moving onto the next section that needs work.
bad,They make any time up climb up nearly impossible and expect more and more work to be done without proper compensation. They only offer a 25c years raises and are just not a friendly company overall.
bad,CVS wasn't a bad place to work. They just didn't pay very well and there's not much room for advancement. A lot of changes to improve business but not employer verse employee relationship.
bad,"Fear based, oppressive culture. Inexperienced management. 12 hr days are the norm. People are first and foremost driven to divert blame or responsibility to other parties. Actually being productive is secondary."
bad,"Very small staff, not enough to run store properly and get daily work finished.  Required frequent touch ups by all managers in district.  Good pay but outweighed by long working hours and high expectations that could not be met with number of hours allocated to store for employees.  Hardest part of job is daily maintenance of store, easiest part was stocking shelves on warehouse days."
bad,"I started as a shift supervisor 5 years ago and just recently became promoted to operations supervisor. The company has cut back so much on hours that now I am just basically a cashier. I do not mind being a team player and will do my part to help. However, I worked very hard to get where I am and feel like I am being undervalued in the workplace. Interacting with customers can be very fulfilling but at the same time challenging. Establishing relationships with regular customers and making them happy are my favorite part of my job."
bad,"Caremark Specialty Pharmacy expected a lot out of me and did not appreciate what they were getting. I gave 100%, so they wanted 150%, but compensated as if I gave 50%."
bad,"New CEO made many changes and cut hours, seemed to care less about the minions making his money and making it more difficult to find hours to work. New policies were put into place that made all employees Seem like thieves."
bad,"In the 3.5 years I worked in the same market, I had 3 different bosses. The newest of which was totally clueless and unprepared."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of showing up and finding a cramped place to stand and fill prescriptions for 10 hours. There was minimal talking allowed which made team morale seem desolate at times. However, in my silence, I was able to learn many new drugs and their usages. The best part of the job was the Pharmacists the company employed. They were all very knowledgable and helpful.  Oddly enough I was not managed by these wonderful pharmacists; I was managed by a separate figure which seemed counterproductive."
bad,"Corporate tends to cut hours for the stores in our area very often yet somehow expect the guidelines for scheduling enough people to be followed though there are inadequate hours on budget. Furthermore, the stronger technicians are scheduled very often and stretched thinly despite how hard they work because corporate would rather keep their scores and numbers high in comparison to having newer members trained well enough to have a balanced workload among all team members."
bad,"I do not recall my time at CVS other than I wanted to leave; looking at my resume it has been over 6 years since I have worked for them. I do not remember it being a pleasurable experience however, I cannot go into further details."
bad,I’ve been with the company for 6 years working crazy shift holding different positions and the company has taking money from me and made me feel unappreciated!
bad,Not going to comment. Once you work there you can make your own judgement about the location. Can be flexible depending on how you make it and if you get along with management
bad,"I worked at CVS Pharmacy with 5 years experience and a Pharmacy Technician license as a technician.  "
bad,Both my wife and I worked for CVS.  Their work load is very stressful. They are very demanding.  At least that was our experience in Louisiana.  I would not work for them again.
bad,"prefer not to discuss/disclose too much info"
bad,"I did my internship with CVS, its hard for me to truly judge the pros and cons. The time I was there it was different. I think that the pay could have been much better."
bad,Management does not take care of their employees and is the main reason for the attrition of all the good employees.  The expected performance metrics are unattainable and creates a toxically stressfully work environment. There unfortunately in not one thing nice that I can say about working at CVS.
bad,I enjoy working at CVS for the most part however the amount of responsibilities they give an employee does NOT reflect their job title nor pay. I was often told that I would be advancing to a lead position but that never happened in all of the 4 1/2 years I have been there and I have seen other employees that have been with the company for a much less shorter time be promoted. I know I am a good worker as my work often shows and I hardly take any time off for myself.
bad,"Customers were unhappy due to the unavailability of medications."
bad,Right now the numbers are more important than well being and happiness of the employees.  In the past this store was  rated the top ten stores in the country now we low down on the list.  There are not enough trained people to cover what needs to be done well.
bad,A large corporation like CVS is very difficult to work for The computers barley works we are constantly calling HR for a new scanner and we still haven't received one. The new work load is chaotic because we cannot pull medication they way we use. customers keeps complaining that their medication is not ready when they come in to pick up their medication. The lines are much longer now due to the fill time on the scripts.
bad,"Pharmacists shouldn't run a call center.  Call center upper management should be people with that experience.  Focus should be on patient experience, not numbers."
bad,"Frankly I felt like a bean counter. I was just a number to a faceless Corporation. The pharmacy manager was amazing, but even he felt like that. My employment there ended unfortunately due to a lapse in my licensure which went unnoticed by everyone until many months after it had expired. When the State Board came into to investigation CBS through all of the text under the bus. My license was not the only one that was lapsed. CBS took none of the responsibilities and all of us had to fend for ourselves. They fired us too."
bad,the company overall does not care much about its worker's health. Turn overs are high partly due to a ridiculously high demand in tasks and expectations while working hours are slashed.
bad,"Alot of the same work every day with very little challenge. No breaks. Culture changes according to mood. Public can be diifficult or rewarding, depends on there mood."
bad,Passed up for promotion because someone else threatened to quit and got the job. Promotion wasn't even offered to anyone. Not a fair working environment.
bad,"CVS has been very good to me. They have very good benefits and you can make good money if you are an external hire. Work life balance...especially if you run a good store...is non existent. If you are worth anything as a manager...they will have you at other stores fixing other store managers' messes. It doesn't matter what area you work in...it will happen. The reality is they are planning on phasing out the store managers. They are moving more and more to the healthcare realm. They want all new hires willing to be crosstrained in the pharmacy, and the word is getting out that they are going to start having Pharmacists running stores."
bad,Worked as a tech. Probably the most boring job ever. Made me realize I never wanted to work in retail pharmacy. Honestly it was just ok. Was very happy to get another job.
bad,Understaffed and difficult to manage huge workload with unreasonable expectations. Although it is great to work for the community the values of CVS are not as they state. They do not care for patients just numbers. They also do not respect staff.
bad,"CVS is notorious for putting pharmacists in a pickle. Pharmacists and supporting staff are constantly under stress to meet impossible corporate metrics. Pharmacies are constantly understaffed and overwhelmed. Benefits are great, work/life balance is non-existent."
bad,"Very restrictive atmosphere, each employee is closely monitored via supervisor staff, desktop view and cameras. Supervisor staff are always looking for reasons to write up or fire employees. It is not a team friendly place to work."
bad,"If you work in a high volume store like I did, the atmosphere is so hostile and toxic. Patients constantly yelling at coworkers, COWORKERS yelling at coworkers, it’s very stressful and manic. I could take it, but I doubt most of the population could. Meanwhile, you also have corporate in your ear telling you that you need to reach certain quotas that are severely unattainable."
bad,Starting as a cashier was taken advantage of by having hours subtracted from my pay check without knowing. The bottom of the chain employees are highly disrespected.
bad,"I thought that working for a Fortune 7 company would include great data, analytics and cutting edge tools, but that is not the case. This company manages to profit by paying frontline folks very low wages and not investing in any infrastructure or technology that will keep them competitive in the future. The customer service and experience continues to decline as corners are cut to maintain profits."
bad,This company promises alot of stuff but never follows through with what they promise. Hardly ever got to see family and missed holidays. Would be ok to work for of you only worked part time.The benefits are pretty good though.
bad,If you can’t pick at 100% then they will fire you.  You have to be very fast and pick accurately.  As the location manager says...there is no cash register up front so he makes no money off people.  What he fails to realize is that without people CVS would make no money because no store would have no stock.  They don’t care if you show up every day and miss no time. They just care that you pick at 100% or more.  Many cut throat employees.  They will shove you out of their way.  Some of them are not friendly to new employees.  You never know how many hours you will work that day until about 8 am and you are required to stay until the quantity they need for your shift is picked. Totes can be very heavy.
bad,"always understaffed, very stressful, expectations too high, high volume days with very minimal staff, no lunch break, may work 8 hours to 12 hours without a break."
bad,"CVS was one of the worst companies I have worked for because they treat their employees badly, and Overtime was never known until the end of the shift mere minutes before the overtime was required to be worked."
bad,"Horror stories are true!! Optimum scheduling means optimum bonuses for CEO. OLD/failing equipment, wont give us the tools or personnel to do our job. Some techs are very good, others...If you can fog a mirror, you can be hired as a tech in training!"
bad,"This job has good and bad days but after a few years, you will feel as though the company is sucking your soul out and there is not much room for advancement and the pay is not great but not the worst either ."
bad,"Good income, and ability to add with additional coverage ; benefits and  average culture."
bad,"There is little in the way of growth or opportunity at CVS. The heath insurance is only good for pharmaceutical prescriptions, not prevention or doctor visits. The wages are stagnant and poverty level. The employee discount is minuscule. No educational advancement opportunities are offered. Flexible hours are available though, at most locations."
bad,One advantage for working with the company is that it provides benefits for all full time employees and also compensation can be some-what competitive.
bad,I enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers & customers. Management was good but corporate had too much control over issues they had no idea about because they did not work with the public on a daily basis. There was not enough employees or time in the day to do all that was required of an employee by corporate.
bad,"The broad idea of with CVS, to help others towards better help, is a great idea and respectable but doesn't match with how they treat their employees. Management was too intertwined with the Pharmacy which some had little to zero pharmacy experience. Understaffed, amount of hours given not matching work-load of specific pharmacies, just not worth it. CVS gets you in quick and allows you to work right away, but corporate is too greedy and job stability seems to be wishy-washy."
bad,"the company is very driven by profits and does everything in it's ability to squeeze out as much from the employees while giving them as little as they can get away with. and they continue to find more ways to make money, patient care is secondary and maybe tertiary on their agenda."
bad,Cvs care nothing about employees they give you raises that such and make so much money they care nothing about employees their big concern is getting prescriptions out
bad,"The company or at least the office/location I was in, was a very nice place. Clean. Bright. Friendly. Large work spaces. However they say ""oh you'll have about two month overtime requirement period"" which actually doesn't end but for like three months and you can not choose when is convenient for you like say if your'e a  single mother like me with no support. They just write you up for not getting the amount needed or not being able to work that night or that Saturday and then fire you. Oh and they schedule your bathroom breaks for you. so I wouldn't drink anything during the day if I were you."
bad,"The company works with no specific time to leave, some days 8 h another 12 hour and is mandatory stay till finish all schedule day work. The supervisor is so busy and dont have time to inspect the coworkers."
bad,"We are constantly given more duties to do but our tech hours are constantly decreasing.  More workload, less help.  Metrics are constantly changing.  There is much overlap of duties; very unstructured.  Pharmacist is regularly treated as a clerk by the other clerks."
bad,Good work environment but constantly cutting hours yet always short staffed. Had to work many different stores to get hours when my own needed help because I wasn’t getting scheduled.
bad,CVS is difficult to work for because it is all about the number of prescriptions filled. They do not encourage patient counseling . The pharmacist do not get a regular break in 12 hrs. You sit when you get a chance.
bad,This was my first PBM job and I was excited about the career possibilities.  I have encountered working with some very good people who helped me when I needed help.
bad,"Depending on what division you are in with the company, your experience may vary.  The amount of pressure and stress at times can definitely be overwhelming.  Mistakes are completely frowned upon and gives you high anxiety making it so you are afraid to make the mistake.  Management was extremely helpful and forgiving at times and would often help me learn from my mistakes.  However, if it is escalated and it is out of management's jurisdiction, then there will is no forgiveness for making mistakes.  If it comes down to saving the company's image versus making sound decisions, chances are that saving the company's image will be the way they would gear towards."
bad,This place is horrible on communication and has been cutting hours. Too much work to do for not enough staff. Love the job but hate the management. Too much favoritism.
bad,"I have learned a lot about organization, insurance and pharmacy. The management has been poor with high turn over. Should be a great place to work but needs better employee moral and support. Company focuses so much on numbers and not enough on patient care."
bad,CVS is a healthcare company that is only focused on pushing metrics on prescriptions. Meeting metrics is more important than customer service. Company doens't value you as an employee and will be quick to replace you if they need to.
bad,This company has it freezing cold and if you have a jacket thathas a hood you are not allowed to wear it and when you get sick you get written up for missing work.
bad,"When it comes to working at a pharmacy, CVS would be my last choice. The company only cares about profits while treating their employees with zero respect. Employees are viewed as disposable, not like part of the company."
bad,"Responsible for being a cashier, photo tech, managing inventory, keeping store clean, etc. Very poor management, very little room for advancement. Employees are shown the bare minimum of appreciation/ praise when it comes to their hard work."
bad,"Patients were actually the best part of this job. The employees were very immature,didn't care about their job nor the patients. Pharmacy Manager was their for the paycheck and title. I was sexually harassed and discriminated against all while the manager was there when it happened or was notified of the situation and still did nothing. Pharmacy is 95%females and I was told that it was a woman's world back there to get used to it.If you are a serous, dedicated worker then CVS is not the place for you"
bad,"CVS pharmacy as a whole underpays their employees, however the benefits have the potential to be quite nice depending on how long you work there. A typical day is quite fast paced with not much time to be thorough with each patient or other tasks performed mostly by management. My specific pharmacy manager was amazing, but the district and regional teams were hard to work with, often not listening or understanding our concerns and problems with the daily store functions. If you find the right store you may be in luck, otherwise there's not much satisfaction to be found."
bad,"1.) Sign in "
bad,"Workload was so unorganized, management was unorganized. I would not recommend anyone to ever go and work for this company. Hopefully they get new management to come in and fix this place up."
bad,At first I loved working for CVS until we had new management and then everything went downhill. I learned a lot about retail while I was there. The store I was at was just very unprofessional and had a lot of drama.
bad,"Purposeful Darwinism is the culture, so make sure you never get old or weak or sick.  Workload is extremely heavy and the support is very light.  I think the company LOST two age discrimination lawsuits in Alabama alone."
bad,"Typical clicks and favoritism industry on both ends, specialty and retail.  Can't get reliable hours to survive. "
bad,"While the job isn't hard in itself and the scheduling is flexible, job advancements aren't available at your fingertips, nor does upper management offer them to you which is crummy. There is a huge lack of security and the staff is at bare minimum with really low wages. They need to offer better pay and in-store security for what they expect."
bad,"The typical day at the pharmacy is you walk in and get right to work. We have a board that you are in a particular area for 1-2 hours, and then we rotate. You have to put in prescriptions, process insurance information, call insurance companies and doctors in case there are any issues with the prescriptions."
bad,"It's a job if you need a job, but outside of that...not really a place to stay if you come in as a cashier. It's really hard to move up and it's hard to run a store as a manager because there's only ever 2 people."
bad,"No work life balance and cut throat employees. Great pay and benefits. Keep up the pace and keep your mouth shut to survive."
bad,"Walking into work is dreadful. The management has turned their backs on caring for their employees. The managers are so stressed all the time, they make your job feel stressful. Its not a good work environment. You do not feel appreciated for the work you do and hours your put into working. Honestly would not reccommend this job for anyone, anymore,"
bad,"Majority of staff are friendly. You are working closely with customers in a retail situation. The hours are not regular depending on script count. As with any retail corporation, the push to sell extras, extras totally unrelated to filling prescriptions, is huge and reported monthly and weekly."
bad,"Would not recommend to a friends if they don’t like call centers. Supervisors has favoritism, not a friendly environment, sitting all day handle several customers attitude."
bad,Only concerned about numbers not facts and pleasing higher managers at the expense of lower employees. Note more monitoring of manager behavior must be enforced to prevent abuse in the workplace.
bad,This is a tough company to work for.  One day they follow rules and procedures next they don't.  Management talked about other employees to other employees.  There was no trust.
bad,alot of coupons and dealing with people who have attitudes also there are some customers who already come in upset because they in need of there prescription. good side there is alot you can learn and move up but doesn't pay well
bad,I can only explain the company structure as I knew it  at the time.  Caremark had purchased several sites across the country.  Each of those sites had a special focus.  There was not a centralized corporate office.  Business meetings were accomplished by conference calls since most of the staff needed in a meeting lived in various parts of the country.
bad,they need better management. they need to pay their techs better and give better raises. also more sick time would be appreciated so that we dont have to use our vacation.
bad,"I would say if you love a non-stop work environment with no time to sit for lunch, than this would be a perfect fit. I feel the pay is low for what is required of a pharmacy tech. I worked for the company for eleven years and made about a $2.00 increase in pay from the min. wage of $7.25 and hr. now that was awhile ago, maybe things have changed."
bad,"When you work for a company for 5 years and they cap the pay you recieve and then halt any advancement you can get then it seems that no matter what you do you can never get ahead. Therefore, you have no incentive to do better or want to be better. It was good in the begining but once you hit a certain point it gets to a point were more and more keeps getting asked and the compensation doesn't change."
bad,"Very poorly managed, zero accountability, extremely poor communication, an abundance of errors, poor record keeping, lazy employees, low morale, etc."
bad,NA stressful fast paced ... but not bad for a first job if your looking to have some type of certification- pharmacy technician-test are usually paid for
bad,I'd always come into work being a complete and utter mess. I transferred from a store on the mainland where that was tolerated and it drove me mad. I was made to stay 12 hour shifts on Saturdays with 30 minute lunches and would get yelled at if I sat down. Best decision I ever made
bad,"Other than the lack of pay for the amount of work done and the ability to move up within the company, this was an okay place to work. My main concern is that this job does not provide well for a family in today's economy."
bad,CVS took acquired Omnicare and since that day CVS came in the moral is low for employees. Corporates asks way to much of its employees in order to be successful. It seems that CVS does not have the patients best interest at heart while making some decision. The are running the long term care pharmacy like a retail model which is preventing success for the pharmacies. The project implementations are run very poorly and expect the pharmacy to figure out how to cope with the new changes when the changes do not work.
bad,"If you're looking to advance quickly in pharmaceuticals this is the place without schooling or being licensed til after training, but they cut hours unexpectedly and don't pay you what they should !"
bad,"They expected SO MUCH out of everyone. They required everyone to work 12 hours Monday through Friday in addition to some Saturdays where we only got one day off with five twelve hour days. The workers only complain and find shortcuts that make work harder for everyone else and management is never around to catch any of the problems. They do give a lot of breaks and those thousand dollar paychecks were nice, but overall not worth it."
bad,The higher ups make working for the company unbearable. Employees are not appreciated enough for all the stress and hardwork they put in. I have personally seen over 100 outstanding technicians leave to other companies because of the working environment
bad,"I have been working as a shift supervisor for over a year. I received my tech in training license in pharmacy as well to help with advancement in the company and for some reason I was put into the system as part time although I have been working full time since day one. I have repeatedly tried to get HR and my manager to fix this, because I am not eligible for benefits or vacation unless it is fixed.  I have lost many hours worth of vacation due to it.  Advancement is impossible unless you have a degree, this job is a joke. Dms are jerks and all corporate looks down you. Most store managers are jokes unless they have been with company for a while."
bad,"The company is heading in the right direction too fast. Which means it does not take time for the stores to adjust or the technical part of the company to work out it's glitches. The company is trying to operate like a high volume(Walmart-Target) but uses minimum hours to achieve it. Turn over is up and very good talent is slowly deteriorating. I don't believe corporate is intending to force these hardships on the stores, I just think they are out of touch."
bad,"I got along great with my coworkers and the pharmacists and the pharmacy manager, but everyone above that lvel acted like an SS Officer, and it was very hard to, day in and day out, force old people to pay hundred of dollars for medicine they needed to survive, and make up excuses for greedy pharmaceutical companies and CVS corporate's poor planning and corner cutting."
bad,"The Clinical department management at ACS Pharmacy is very disappointing. They show favoritism and do not care about their staff! They gossip about everyone and only care about themselves and their bosses! Don’t get me wrong as ACS environment is a great place to work but working in the clinical department would be a big mistake! I was told that now they don’t do private exit interviews that you would usually complete online because of the negative responses management would get so now they have management do the exit interview with you in person which doesn’t make it trustworthy because who’s to say that they would actually report your complaints about them to HR! Most people who left was due to not being happy with management but will anyone ever know...no! Also, for the past year we were told that we would be working from home but it seems like that was all a lie so that majority of the staff wouldn’t leave as it would’ve been a very high turnover rate in that department because people were wanting to leave because they hated the new management team but stayed due to the opportunity of working from home knowing that they won’t have to deal with the gossiping crew! I literally can go on and on but unfortunately I have to get back to work! And believe me, I’m currently looking for another job as I type and I also plan to send a little anonymous letter to HR before I leave!"
bad,The Manager was too friendly with the employees. Never enough help and not enough pay. I liked the job and the responsibility but the employees were left a lot to be desired.
bad,Pay scale wasn't good. Culture was good at all. Leadership roles needs improvement top to bottom. Sometimes the work schedule can benefit outside personal life.
bad,"CVS is a high demanding job. You must make rate and now they have decided to restructure so if the job is ""easy"" you now get to do the work of two employees. The turn over rate is rough, no one stays because you never know how long you are working til the day of. All over time is mandatory so forget having a personal life. You will work 9-12 hours in the holiday seasons."
bad,"Okay place to work, few benefits, low pay, union, Somewhat works with schedule. Great co workers. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
bad,It was alright to work there. Management needs should be a little better. They definitely need more training for new workers. I had an ok experience. There is nothing to brag about at this job. It is a high turn over rate.
bad,I wouldn't recommend for long term because it takes a toll on your body. the pay is good and there are many opportunities to move around in the warehouse.
bad,"I have been a licensed to work in the state of Nevada for 6 years. They told my employees that they were able to keep the same hours and pay. Of all my old employees that tried to work at CVS all of them were treated with disrespect, including my-self. "
bad,For this company to have so much money they do not care about their employees. Employees are highly underpaid for the amount of work and expectations given. There is no room for growth. I was a Pharmacy tech for 5 years and only at $10 a hour. They would rather keep hiring new people rather than give current employees more money. Annual raises don't exceed 35 cents. All they care about is their scores!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"training was performed on a totally different program than the one you were going to be working. also the trainer said not to make outbound calls and when you got your qa they dinged you for not taking the extra step to come up with the answer for the member."
bad,"under paid, terrible training, I dont  believe its worth it. I recommend  you find a different job.Trainers need training on how to train. People are nice to work with."
bad,Great part time job for high school and college students. Good internship opportunity for pharmacy students. Generally overworked and pay is exceptionally low for certified pharmacy technicians. Most lower level staff members are fully expendable
bad,This job is stressful and they dont worry about the employee as they suppost to and i think their pay is not good. They should pay more to they employee and have better management.
bad,"Great company to begin from scratch and turning yourself into a Certified Pharmacy Technician. I learned a lot about customer service, handling insurance companies, medications, and more."
bad,"Stressful job in Pharmacy to meet company expectations. Most techs are severely underpaid, and there is a cap on how much you can make no matter how well you perform."
bad,Fast pace  job security you  could be a hard working employee but  the company don't appreciate there employee it more of company against the employee instead of thriven  together to make it a better company
bad,"Not a terrible place to work but definitely wouldn't be my top pick. Very stressful environment, severly understaffed and the turn over rate is really high. People come here to get enough experience to find something better. Management is not on the same page. One person will tell you to do one thing then another will pull you from that task and tell you to do something else. Stress is through the roof for most of the staff and morale has greatly reduced since CVS took over."
bad,"When I first started with CVS Pharmacy I loved my job. I was working between 40-60 hours a week and enjoyed it. I traveled across the states with CVS and they were very easy to transfer with. When my parents were dying CVS was very willing to work with me so I could keep my parents home and well taken care of . "
bad,"The environment of CVS/pharmacy is very typical to the average retail pharmacy chain. It is fast-paced and metric-driven.  You work in close-contact with your patients and a small team of technicians/staff pharmacists.  I especially enjoy developing relationships with regular patients and with my staff, however payroll is very low so oftentimes day-to-day activities can be stressful."
bad,"You were in a classroom for 2 weeks and then sent out to do live work. What you learned in the classroom is not what you do on the floor. Everyone says they're so helpful but they help you when they want to, not when you need it! The management is terrible. There is no HR and they don't make you feel welcomed."
bad,Production and Operations are awesome to work with and be a part of.  Management really needs to understand this type of pharmacy and have a much needed structure of the business.
bad,"Verify physician orders send from various nursing homes. "
bad,Need to be skilled in typing prescriptions quickly and being able to handle customers under extreme pressure. Need to be aware of insurance policies and insurance plans. Need to be proficient in using different software programs.
bad,"They expect 70 hours a week from you most weeks.  Conf calls at 7:15am twice a week even on days off.  Very little training.  Not enough tech help EVER and my district supervisor wasn't even licensed.  All she did was crunch numbers and say ""fix it"".  She gave no insight on HOW TO FIX any issues and I was hired in to work at a ""challenge store"" which means that it's not doing well and I was expected to fix it with no training.  "
bad,its a descent place but they lie about your schedule and time is much needed . not new parent friendly schedule . The hiring process is lengthy and not very accurate as far as the schedule hours go when hired .
bad,"Poor business practices and management make this a difficult environment in which to work efficiently. There is a complete disregard for employee safety, not sure how they have avoided  OSHA violations."
bad,"When I interviewed for my position I was told all these wonderful things about benefits and bonuses and potential for advancement. Upon taking the position I quickly learned that literally everything said was untrue. Pay was often late or missing, a very hostile environment. It was honestly deeply upsetting,"
bad,"You are just a number in the company. Stressful environment for minum wage. Discount is good, but culture is bad. Employees are always wrong in the eyes of CVS. Upper management does not help out at all, the only time they help is when their raises are coming up."
bad,Cvs was an ok place to work until i realized i was due for a raise a yr ago. when it was brought to there attention they tried every method to fire me or make me quit. They begin giving me 4 hrs a week. Till i quit
bad,It was a very busy store all the time and a great place to work but I did not approve of my co-workers and the manager wasn't always 100%. The hours were fine and so was the pay.
bad,"Overall I recommend you not to apply to this company unless you have to. Although I had a great Management team who like a lot, but you just doing more work than what you're getting paid for. And the raise you get is terrible. This job is more for the younger age groups, than the middle age groups."
bad,"over-worked, under-payed, not enough training, not much room for advancement. Emplyees are in and out like a revolving door.  As a result, mistakes are constantly being made. The more competent technicians usually find employment elsewhere leaving the inexperienced or incompetent techs behind."
bad,lots of management turnover and don't get any responses when you need them. disorganized and chaotic at times. I do not recommend this company. high employee turnover. seems as though nothing gets done.
bad,So much work and not enough staff. The pay is nothing compared to the work amount that one has to do. I have been working for over a year and still havent gotten a raise.
bad,"CVS was in my experience a very impersonal place to work...my managers were not understanding about my health issues or flexible with my schedule.  It's very much a 'live to work' as opposed to a 'work to live' environment.  Any above & beyond effort was not appreciated, it was expected"
bad,"I enjoy what the job is, but the way they run the warehouse is very unorganized. they make rules up daily. everything counts against you.. even if you have physical documents of being at the doctors office, or the ER. They still write you up."
bad,"The company was actually Xerox and was just  contracted with CVS Caremark. Xerox call centers in Houston have known representations for  not being on the very professional side as far as management and employees, however it is a quick hire, easy customer service position, and quick fix for needed income."
bad,"typical day at CVS was very stressful, and time managed the whole day even who went on break and time. hardest part was counting prescriptions on time and calling insurances because this person wanted to pay or use to pay a certain amount. Everyone i worked with was super nice and helpful. I learned time management and how to put in insurance cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had a slow day and we could organize things"
bad,"To me CVS presented more problems then any job i had ever worked. I have never dealt with so much co-worker drama on my life. Everybody talked about everyone in every pharmacy i worked at. The pharmacist treated you like you were stupid. Everyone always got an attitude when you asked them for help with anything you didn't know. A lot, of cashier time and not enough time actually learning how to do everything. Tons of modules to complete and meetings that don't necessarily help you. The job has the potential to be good it just attracted some really terrible people."
bad,"The front store retail setting does not have true growth potential. The business is often understaffed, leaving employees at risk. Such a well respected company, with a large number of disgruntled employees. There is job security because the turnover is high, but ethics are lax. The employees that have longevity are either upper management or pharmacy staff."
bad,Very busy place to work for but provide a lot of education through training videos and reviews. A lot of customer-based interaction.  Had an overall positive experience.
bad,"not that great. very hectic. at end of day and all the work, its still not enough. most of all, NOT ENOUGH staffing. When you need 4 techs, they'll stick you with 2. When you need 2, you'll get none."
bad,Hardest part of job was always being on call 7 days a week.  Not getting enough hours during the summer months. There were several weeks I had 0 hours.  Had to find another job quick. No respect between management and technicians about schedule or time off. Never knew what you were going to do from one day to next. Tech expectations way too much and patient safety compromised daily. No Joke.  You could not trust coworkers to show up or just walk out door from pure frustration.  This job is the most stressful one I have ever held.  Working in tobacco field as a teenager was easier than CVS JOB.My entire family and neighbors have left CVS for other pharmacies to fill their future needs.
bad,"The computer system is not made to streamline prescriptions. It lacks efficiency for a quick productive pace, but that is what the company requires. Everything is timed and graded, but workload isn't balanced properly to help you meet expectations. For instance I can come into work and have 20 acute prescriptions due within the 1st 30 minutes in addition to drop offs and pick ups. It is not realistic. Technicians are not allowed to fulfill basic duties covered under their licenses causing these duties to fall on the pharmacists' shoulders when they already have a lot of duties to cover. pharmacists duties spread them thin. The hiring system is not setup to help you find the best candidates for the job. They require a license for us to hire a technician, but their hiring system flags non-licensed individuals as the best fit for the job?? Also, there is supposed to be partnership with free standing stores in the area to share resources (i.e.. people), but it is not true. The district manager for free standing cvs stores will not allow sharing of resources."
bad,High stress environment. Not enough tech help.  very little support from upper management.14 hour shifts with no breaks.
bad,"A lot of stress, but decent hours. It;s hard to really grasp everything because it's so busy and dealing with insurances is difficult"
bad,The staff is usually great as well as the customers.  The workload would be more manageable if establishment was better staffed.  Requires much patients.
bad,"Prepare for a rush, many angry and sick patients. In which i have learned to keep an professional attitude. The co-workers that i was hired with are amazing, very helpful and wants everyone to succeed. The hardest part of the job is trying to allow the old hires to know you're just at the job to work. That it isn't an competition. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers, even after they have a fit about why their items aren't done on time. They would come back to the new hires and say ""i apologize it isn't your fault i wasn't yelling at you thank you for being patient with me."" That was always a plus to any day!"
bad,Prepare to sell your soul to this company if you decide to work for this them especially in a managerial setting. Too many tasks are given on top of mandatory procedures and not enough hours are given to hire enough employees to complete everything. Completely unethical company.
bad,"A typical day was coming in checking the queues to see what needed to be done, making phone calls to dr., offices and doing intake. I've learned to work on the AS400 system and how to deal with  Med D coverage determinations."
bad,"If you're looking for pharmacists that get overworked to the brink of exhaustion, no lunch breaks, and having to work for these poor souls, most of which are fantastic people all while having upper management care zero for their health, welfare, or their technicians this is the place for you."
bad,"I started out loving my job, unfortunately after two and a half years the company started to go down hill and never recovered. So I decided it was time for a change."
bad,"Working for more then a year at Chd Specialty comfortable building with cafeteria and gym. Management does not care to resolve any real issue they  just put bandaids on . They give a great pto and holiday pay package but then get mad when you use the days. If they don't want you to apply for promotions they use any excuse to write you up which prevents you from being considered for promotions , if they like you they will not write you up no matter what you do . HR department could careless about employees needs they are just there to support Mgt and have no interest n getting to the problems of reported complaints.  Co workers are cool there will always be differences when you work with 1000+ people . Most frustrating thing is we are not given tools to resolve patient issues just running in circles most of the time . I hope I never become dependent on a pharm like this or I'm in big trouble"
bad,"Pay is just above minimum wage. You are on your feet all day in a fast paced environment. Co-workers are nice. There is a lot of red tape to advance quickly, but if you are young and have the inclination to learn, you can. You do have to pass Pharm Tech certification to have the job. I found nothing enjoyable about working here, except I have a job, but I hate working. The hardest part is the physical strain it puts on your body for 8 hours. But if you have worked in a warehouse environment, then this is better then any retail Pharmacy Tech position. Pay is a little bit more and you don't have to work in a retail setting, where a Pharmacy Tech has to deal with customers, while dealing with paperwork, insurance procedures/professionals, medical professionals, pulling meds, counting pills, all while being your feet 8 hours a day. The only reason I gave 3 stars to Compensation/Benefits is due to the good medical benefits. But even that needs work."
bad,Not a good environment to work in.  Not enough auxiliary staff.  It's only about the numbers with this pharmacy.  The pharmacist-patient relationship is virtually nonexistent.  This company breeds an atmosphere of discontent.
bad,"This job is very stressful, things constantly change way more than they should. i wouldn't tell anyone to apply to this job. just to the high stress level, customers talk to you like your trash. Not a fun job."
bad,"I worked there for one year as a Packing Technician.  After starting at a lower than expected pay rate as a CphT, and learning most of the jobs in the pharmacy, I received no raises in pay. The work environment is as casual and as unprofessional as the dress code. Cell phone use in the pharmacy, not following all safety protocols, lax site security, ripped blue jeans, short shorts and flip flops worn in the office and on the production floor. The pharmacy manager is seldom seen on the production floor. When the manager is around, the manager plays favorites with employees, so avoid getting on the managers bad side. Low morale is the norm here. HR only visits location about every 4-6 weeks. They will not listen to you anyways. Most of the older workers are nice, friendly and have a good work ethic, the younger ones seem to just want to have fun."
bad,This is your standard run of the mill customer service job with high priced medications and addicts threatening your life. If you like this kind of stuff then this is the job for you.
bad,Great Company for advancement. I have no college degree and worked my way from a contract employee to a Full time employee. Additionally i was promoted 4 times within 4 years. Hard work and dedication pay off
bad,"I have worked for CVS Health for around 9 years. I have worked for a couple store locations. Most recently the CVS in Manlius. Lately, I have seen a lot of Employees come and go. I have seen a lot of struggle within this company. It seems to have started since Caremark acquired CVS. They turned away from the friendly atmosphere they once knew and became money hungry. Reducing hours, asking more and more of hard working employees with little compensation. You get vacation, but if you should ever work for the Manlius CVSHealth store, good luck using it. Doctors appointments? Good luck getting time off for one of those, even if you have a condition. Very little care in this company. It is a bit sickening a company like this can exist. Beware of this company. It will turn you into husk of what you once were."
bad,Overwhelming place to work. Under staff. Over worked. Not a happy place to work at. Management is not good at all. Lots of drama with co-workers. Benefits are ok
bad,"Provide exceptional support to patients and healthcare providers by greeting them in person and by phone; answering questions and requests; referring inquiries to the pharmacist"
bad,"I worked here very recently however the team leads are always against you. They never introduce themselves to you and when you ask a question they treat you like you are stupid even though you are brand new. I was on the phone with customers and Pharmacists are screaming at you in the back ground because they do not want you to transfer the call to them, but you needed to because we didn't have the answer. They would refuse the calls and you were left to make something up. It was a miserable experience and I wouldn't go back if you paid me to."
bad,The company used to be all about customer service. Now the company is mainly concerned with scores and finding ways to grade everyone on everything. The are not customer oriented in any way. They will put all of the tasks on one person and have every one else not have any responsibilities.
bad,"Under paid, over worked. Not recognized for accomplishments or hard work. No room for advancement and the pay is embarrassing."
bad,"While it is satisfying when you can provide patients with the care and medicine that they need, the difficulties of the job outweigh the rewards. The company itself makes a habit of hiring as few Pharmacy Technicians as possible for as few hours as possible while loading virtually all of the labor onto the Pharmacists. As a result, there are many busy weekends when the store is so understaffed that it is impossible to provide for the customers in a timely or appropriate way. I was often required to work during rush hour with only myself and a Pharmacist when there were long lines at the drive-through, pick-up desk, drop-off desk, and consultation desk as well as a huge pile of orders to fill all at once. Despite this enormous amount of work and the skill required to do it (as well as my certification), I was only paid minimum wage and sometimes worked as little as 11 hours a week. I got the distinct impression that this was due to decisions made by the district supervisors, and that the store manager had no control over it."
bad,"this company has fine benefits and compensation. nevertheless they have way too much turnover in personnel. probably the worst in the industry.in manhattan management makes you ring up even the miscellaneous items which can back up the workflow. cvs pays biweekly which means 2 paychecks a month. WATCH OUT USUALLY 1 WEEK OF THE BIWEEKLY PAYCHECKS ARE MISSING. IN MANHATTAN IN THE MID 2000'S TO LATE 2000'S THEY SAVED OVER 2.5 MILLION DOLLARS IN PAYROLL WITH THIS DISCREPANCY. they also do a very poor job of training where in fairness to them they have to cover a lot of openings since they will open up 3 or 4 stores a year. from time to time they will ask you to cover extra shifts.if you say yes THEY WILL ALWAYS EXPECT YOU TO SAY YES WHICH WILL LEAD TO BURNOUT AND POSSBILE DISPENSING ERRORS AND THEY MAY STILL FORGET TO PAY YOU FOR THE EXTRA SHIFT!!!!!!!!!!! the employee discount card will give you 30 percent off which is great but the ""politics"" of management is a negative because they let the power and ego get to their heads.in reality my 5 years of cvs was special and I still shop there because they do have fine specials and reward you with great coupons!!!! I wish we had e-scripts during the early to mid 2000's where I could easily handle 900 rx's !!!!!!!!!! sad to say management does not really care and sad to say their is a large degree of phoniness which is bad for morale leading to even a higher turnover rate! but in fairness to management they do have some pharmacists that are a bunch of whining prima donna's!"
bad,"I enjoyed working for CVS the first few years I worked for the company. I learned a lot about the medical & pharmaceutical fields. I was responsible for much of the Pharmacy's operations. During the last year, there was a change in management and saw a lot of favoritism and a drop in employee morale which resulted in poor customer service. I did however, continue to do the best I could under the tense working conditions."
bad,"CVS Health clearly does not care about its employees and offers little to no opportunity to advance and with almost nonexistent benefits. As a cashier, I was being asked to do things that were not in my job description."
bad,"I work a lot but the salary it's very bad... I don't like it.  You can have a fast promotion but the salary is pretty same. I have a good relationship with my manager and my co-workers. They are nice and the store in good. The hardest part of the job is the overnight, and also move a lot of boxes and pallets every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service experience."
bad,You have to stand on your feet a lot. Not enough pay. Not diverse enough. Too much work. Will not recommended to anyone. I learned how to count medication.
bad,not the best company to work for at all.  All of the employees are over worked and they don't care about them.  The breaks are short and the pressure you get from your regional pharmacy manager is unbearable.  I would not work for this company or caremark again.
bad,"They will tell you that accuracy is more important than speed but ""performance"" seems to be measured in cases per hour. Don't expect real feedback on performance.  The feedback you do receive is for really important things like punctuation.   Follow the instruction to ""dig deep"" for information in order to decide a case and you won't last.  Apparently, it is better to ignore the requesting physician's forty pages of office notes and fax a questionnaire to his office.  Then you will appear to work faster."
bad,"Honestly management is horrible, no benefits for part-time workers, over worked and truly underpaid, lack of professionalism from pharmacy management, not all stores, but its a good way to start in pharmacy setting"
bad,Job is but does not take into consideration what we as the workers think would help change the way the company is ran based on what will help the mbr
bad,The management of the company leaves a lot to be desired. The people that work at the company though are very nice and strive to be as helpful as they can within the guidelines they can operate in.
bad,"CVS Health is a challenging company to work for as resources become more and more limited each year. Open positions are not filled and many teams are expected to complete the same work with fewer employees. Management pays a lot of lip service to the corporate culture and opportunity for growth, but in reality work/life balance is often nonexistent and opportunities for advancement are rare. Benefits were excellent at one time, but have been slowly downgraded or eliminated. At a company where ""health is everything,"" the medical benefit is deplorable."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was working with some programmers on site."
bad,"CVS has no interest in developing employees, creates a hostile and non team oriented work environment, and will fabricate situations to fire you if you do not mesh with the group mentality."
bad,"The pay is decent. They low ball you at first, If you are new you will only work pick up and they play favorites a lot. The lead technicians run everything."
bad,"Typical day is always a struggle. With only 1-2 technicians plus a pharmacist, we must balance between typing up prescriptions at drop off, Fill prescriptions, Answer phone calls, Ring out at front counter and drive-up, Inventory, Doctor Calls, Prescription transfers. Patient out reach calls, FLU SHOTS, and Warehouse deliveries and insurance calls."
bad,There is not a lot of advancement within this company. Your salary will always be close to minimum wage . unless you are in a management position
bad,"Above average pay, extremely strict, excellent upward mobility, you will learn quick it's a job not a career. They pay you more because you literally do everything in management with just one cashier ringing up customers."
bad,management used intimidation to the companies advantage.  pay was great but we had to watch our backs for everything.  walls had ears there. everything said between employees had to be said in private or outside the company. company was great until the union was voted in.
bad,"You get to work nights, weekends and holidays with no compensation because it is expected. Nothing is remembered when extra efforts are applied just ""what are you doing for me now""."
bad,Help assist customers around the store to find the product they were looking for. Handling cash for the store. Following direction from management
bad,The pay is good but that is about it. The culture sucks and it is all about who you know in order to excel and advance with in the company. Attrition is very high and the company cares more about the bottom line than they do their employees.
bad,"A company that is viewed so highly by the public for all that they do yet is so poor to work for. As a pharmacy technician, the pay is far below the average even for a retail environment. Inadequate training leads to a crew of employees that should not be responsible dealing with or working in a medical environment field. Pharmacists are forced to overwork to make up for the lack or staff and staff training. Advancement in the job and pay are practically non-existent. Finally the district is managed by a person that knows little about the pharmacy industry in general. Only achievements gained from this job was the knowledge you acquire on your own while doing it, the joy of helping the patients who use the pharmacy, and your own self gratifications. Thanks."
bad,"the work day was stressful."
bad,"I started working at  a CVS distribution warehouse as an order picker during the winter. They tell you when they hire you that you'll be working 8 hour shifts mon-fri with the occasional overtime. NOT TRUE. For almost 5 months we worked anywhere from 9-13 hour shifts. Not knowing when we would get out of there each day. You don't have a specific ending time. You work until the work is done and sometimes you have no idea when that will be. You get two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch a day. If we did not work past 5:30, they would make us work from 1:45-5:30 without a break. You're expected to keep up a ""speed rate"" that is ridiculous. If not, you are reprimanded with a ""write up"" or your job is threatened. There are so many different things that happen everyday on the line that affect your time and there is nothing you can do. You walk away to go to the bathroom? It affects your time. You don't have product and have to go ask the stocker or call up front? It affects your time. The totes they use to ship the medicine are absolutely disgusting because the cvs stores keep them outside after they have opened and emptied them. Often times they are soaked with rainwater. Cvs expects you to put cardboard in the bottom of each wet tote to keep the medicine dry. Your hands get absolutely disgusting. They never have a cleaning crew come in and clean the warehouse. The whole places is coated with brown and black dust. I come home almost everyday with black stuff in the corners of my nose from the fans blowing it around. Disgusting. CVS' motto is health this and health that for their customers"
bad,"A typical day at CVS was to go in put away shipment and face the store, making sure the store looked presentable. I had to report to the manager on duty and learn my tasks for the day. I was the key holder, and I knew pretty much knew what was going on each in department. On busy days, I would help the pharmacy out. Helping the patients get their prescription on time was a must. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers and helping the customers out."
bad,"If you want to learn how the pharmacy field works, this is place to start."
bad,I hated it there. no room for advancement. We got robbed at gunpoint once. its better to work in hospital. they only paid me 10 a hour
bad,"Very disgruntled about my experience with CVS, in total about 20 years with the company and over the past few years of employment constantly felt like I was being forced out.  Many rumors throughout the company that it was in fact their intent to get rid of as many long term employees as possible (forcing early retirement, finding ANY reason to terminate, etc.)"
bad,"High volume work load. Fast paced job. Large volume phone calls. Nice people / coworkers. "
bad,"CVS Healthcare, especially CVS pharmacy doesn't care about it's employees, whether pharmacists or clerks. 30-40 hours per week without breaks for pharmacists. Too few technicians, high pressure to produce prescriptions. Long wait times for patients to receive prescriptions."
bad,"stressful, management does not care about individuals. Pay is horrible. You are expected to bounce around and multitask too much."
bad,"A typical day at work for a Store Manager Trainee is rather similar to that of an associate with added responsibility.  While it's understood that Store Managers have to know the ins and outs of each job, very little training is allowed for actual Managerial duties making it impossible to be effective in the role."
bad,"If you can maintain a positive attitude in a high stress environment, then this job will be okay for you."
bad,I really work with a great team of people. I enjoy talking with the members and helping them get to speak with a pharmacist when they are required too. My typical day is a headset on my head answering telephones 24/7. and taking care of anything the calls may bring to me.
bad,"This is my third stint with this company. The greatest advice is to not trust anyone or anything here. I mutually separated unjustly the first time. The next time it was looking like I was going to convert to a permanent position from contract and the dept shut down. Currently am a contractor and was told that a permanent position would generally be offered after 90-day period. Needless to say, I'm still contract and I am not privy to any of the benefits that my coworkers enjoy. In addition, I've applied for several other positions in which I was highly qualified only to receive a rejection less than 24 hours later and the job still being posted for another month."
bad,Everyone told me that is was a good place to work. When I first stated they told me that I was going to be picking cases on a pallet and using an electric pallet jack to pull them. After I started it was not what I was expecting. The things they expect you to do is like they are asking for someone to get an injury. They really need to find a safer way to have people do the job.
bad,In a typical day I am trying to do 3 things at once in order to get everything done in 8 hours.    We seem to be understaffed most of the time and it's very frustrating.   I love working with the people and I love the customers and enjoy the work but wish I had more time to do it.
bad,We are always shorthanded and no one is ever appreciated. They gave everyone a 4% pay cut at one point. Their policies don't matter because people never get fired or reprimanded.
bad,"CVS is a great company to work for, and I would recommend it to anyone, the only problem is getting hired. I would rate the job overall fun, interesting and educational because you learn how people function, their work habits, and figure our their attitudes."
bad,okay place to start off a career . A great place t learn and get the experience that is needed for advancement.
bad,I enjoyed working at CVS only because of the many different people I ended up meeting.
bad,establishment was fair but employees where not appreciated
bad,"A work day at CVS ( Price changes, Sale Tags, Planner Grams, Photos, Customer's that like to be difficult, Stock (floor and backroom))"
bad,CVS was sanctioned by CMS for a reason. Upper Mgmt still appears to have no clue why.
bad,i learned a lot at omnicare however we were understaffed so i dont feel i had adiquate training before being thrown into the next place i was needed i worked well pass my duties with no compensation. also the point system was very unfair to workers.
bad,"Pharmacy work was a  very interesting experience as I did learn a lot about medication, people and the community as well. I enjoyed that the pharmacy was a community place and our customers felt comfortable to come to us with their concerns. The hardest part of the job was definitely balancing work and personal care for the patient and their lives. Unfortunately, medicine isn't priced so that everyone can buy it, and it was very difficult to deny someone potentially life saving medication. What I take away from this job is that if I want to make a change in the world, I've got to work hard to achieve it and leave behind what I don't need."
bad,"A typical day in a retail pharmacy is usually very busy.  Phones, counters, drive thru and typing new prescriptions.  You have to be able to multi task.  My favorite part of working in a pharmacy is that you get to know all of your customers and they become like family."
bad,No work/life balance to speak of.  Benefits were not that good.
bad,Merchandising is very fast paced and always changing.  Much more than 9 - 5 job
bad,"In my area of their business my local staff is great, but once you get out of the store level employees there is no support and very little action taken by district level employees on up the ladder.  The pay is far below standard (bottom 10%) good place for a short term job, but not a place to base a career."
bad,"Quiet place, with minimal customers. I learned many diffrent techniques on sales pitches, membership planning and recommending items to customers. The managers were kind and very experienced in the workplace but had difficulty when scheduling. Sometimes customers would be rude."
bad,"Do not work for CVS Pharmacy if you dont have to. You barely get any help as a pharmacist, and are expected to do everything like answering phone calls, and running the register. Sometimes I had to take out the trash, because technicians do not have time to do it. "
bad,The job is nice at first but there was no raise and no incentive to want to stay with the company
bad,"Good part time, very flexible. great benefits. good job for going to school."
bad,Work is very busy. Managers & co workers are awesome. Just the company sucks. CVS expects more and cuts hours to employees
bad,"District supervisors are rude, insulting, and lack personal skills. Majority of your day is spent doing tasks that are a complete waste of time. No advancement and pay is around $10 an hour and wont go up much from there."
bad,"Work duties included doing everything from opening to clean up and all productiveness. Managers were slow and lazy, sometimes did not show up on time or care as much about the store as they did with margins and ranking scales. My co-workers were friends and the hardest working people I knew. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to work with a friend. The work loads and hours were difficult because this store was highly under staffed. As a part time employee and full time college student with an internship I was working almost 40 hours a week with only a 20 minute break every 6 hours. And after almost 2 years I started at $8.30 and left making $8.53 an hour."
bad,"In the pharmacy there at CVS we work extremely hard every day. You must be able to multi task in order to be successful there. You must be able to pay full attention to detail and prioritize your work load. It is important to find a steady work pace because it is very easy to fall behind very quickly. The pharmacy is customer service oriented and you have to be understanding, empathetic, and friendly with customers/patients. The team there is tight knit and everyone plays a vital role. We have to have good communication skills and everyone has to follow the work assignment so they know what is expected of them. Working there can be extremely trying because it is very, very busy and you must be proficient in all areas and at all tasks in order to be successful there. This means everyone should be able to work ""drop-off"" which involves inputting prescriptions and data entry and adjudicating insurance claims. Everyone should also be familiar with inventory and familiar with the drugs we stock, where they are stocked and how to handle them (i.e. whether or not something should be refrigerated or left at room temp, or what should be reconstituted before dispensing). Everyone should be familiar with ""production"" or actually filling prescriptions. This includes making sure each patient gets the right drug, right quantity, every time and every medication is labeled and has auxiliary stickers and a med guide if required. You have to be extremely organized in my opinion to be successful here. It can be challenging to be so extremely busy and maintain a friendly demeanor all day long."
bad,most of their positions require six months of worked to be hired by the permanent company.
bad,The only pharmacy worse to work for is Walgreens. With that as an exception...I would certainly not recommend anyone to be employed by CVS
bad,The overall environment with the company could have been better. I have learned a great deal from working with the company and co workers. Helping the customers with they're needs. The management wasn't the best. Tons of things were overlooked before I got there and when I was at the company. The hardest part was trying to do everything you could to please your manager. With no help in return. The most enjoyable part is having the customers acknowledge your hard work and dedication for them.
bad,management was not professional whole training did not have systems nor did I have a actual computer till I got onto the floor trainers were not helpful as explained for the position
bad,CVS was a very stressful environment to work in and the pay should have been better for what you had to deal with.
bad,"When the company was Caremark, it was a GREAT place to work. Management, supervisors and employees worked toward a common goal. There were many types of different incentives. Employee appreciation week was the greatest !!"
bad,"pull labels from the machine then pull medications from the shelves scan the labels then scan the medication type in the qty,lot number expiration date of medications and how many labels are needed to fill the order. "
bad,"-Inbound call center, speaking with members in regards to the Prescription Drug Plans. "
bad,"Typical day is 12 hours, learned how to multi-task, constantly re-prioritize, quickly and accurately calculate doses, verify correctness using an 11-point checklist, utilize small technician staff efficiently, have energetic and dedicated team who share information, help each other, and are dependble. Hardest part of job is dealing with insurances, language barriers, large volume with a small staff, re-prioritizing.  Most enjoyable is knowing we have helped someone, meeting all deadlines, getting each day's work done accurately, getting to know many people.  "
bad,"Company will continue to grow.  Management can be lacking in assistance at times and can be unclear on their motives.  High turnover at the Account Management position as they are not as competitive as other PBMs salary wise.  Although Caremark and CVS are considered the same company it is not easy to move from the PBM side to the retail side.  Technology is seriously lacking there is no urgency to correct mistakes.  HR communicates poorly and does not relay information to employees.  Communication between departments is VERY poor, responsibility is not taken for mistakes and emails are ignored until deemed urgent."
bad,"I worked at CVS for about six months. My first day I should have seen the writing on the wall. The lead tech was friends with the pharmacist and basically got away with down grading, racial slurs and actions, and creating a hostile work environment. I have worked in many industries in my life including the sex industry, and they are alot more respectful decent and kind than any CVS I worked for. I worked ten twelve hour days, short breaks, pay is lousy, and no matter what you do, you are brow beaten to work harder. Its just like kindergarten and high school combined. The customers can yell at you and you have to take it, then when you have nice ones the boss encourages you to cut conversations short, the pharmacist was disgusting, eating and running her hands through her hair and then with out washing her hands pouring drugs in her hands to count pills. CVS should be shut down violating OSHA, breaking pharmacy laws and regulations, it is terrible for workers and customers!"
bad,"CVS in snowballing downhill and corrupted by greed. Stockholders are more important to CVS than their employees are. We do the work, and the people who buy our profit are priority one. Most stores on any given day have 2 front store employees in the store together. One of which is usually not on the sales floor, leaving the cashier to be in charge of money collection, customer relation, greeting every customer even if it mean being rude to the person trying to give you their money; Certainly dont forget cleanliness and photo production as well as stock and odd jobs. You receive a raise once a year and if you are lucky you might get 15 cents, only to be followed up the next year with the stores hours for individuals being cut; Basically a pay cut every year. CVS has no concern for the people in the store making the company its' money. The only way to enjoy working at CVS, is to have a good, efficient, and honest store manager. Otherwise expect lies, passing of the blame, and a horrifying work schedule."
bad,"Had some great times and awesome people to work with. The company itself has no idea, not do they care, that the management running these stores DO THEIR OWN thing and can easily throw people under the bus!!"
bad,company does not care about employees managers do not give overtime when work flow at night is outrageous more people are needed
bad,It's and ok place to work for a short well but not a place to retire from .
bad,Changing culture but is a very slow process. Antiquated management styles and poor employee representation.
bad,"Extremely fast paced environment at times. There are some PSA to help with the registers at times and organized 15 minutes paid to wander around time and 30 minutes unpaid lunch for every 6 hours which walgreens doesn't do unfortunately which gives prefential time to some. Too many CVS technicians to compensate for lack of training. It's a learn as you go pharmacy, which makes up for a lot of the mistakes that happen."
bad,"Not the greatest pharmacy to work for. Unrealistic expectations, sub-par compensation, company's 'values' are not visible on any level. Put in your 6 months and get out of there!!"
bad,"poor work enviornorment, not organized, managment lacked direction and made it hard to lead a group. needs were not on the customers needs, many customers were not given proper pharmacy care."
bad,"Currently working for a very unorgainized, very insufficient compnay"
bad,"Not a very secure job, not much room for growth. Great co-workers, previous management was great."
bad,"A typical day at work was not only hard but, stressful. I was required to train at a location that was undesirably far and was not reimbursed for gas. Once training was completed I was not able implement the lessons learned in my home store. The employees who had been there longer than myself refused to train me in other areas. I was hired on as a part time worker but was forced to work full time hours without full time benefits. I was often called in on my few days off. My boss would leave her duties causing the pharmacy to grind to stop."
bad,Caremark is a very fast and stressful place to work. I learned not to take people's comments personally and that it is just a job. My coworkers that were in training with me kept me going by trying to stay positive for me. This company is good for working with a school schedule if you are in college but when it comes to being a single mother and needing to work around your children...they do not really care
bad,"Just did not like the management very much; worked in a specific job (ATC machine) as a pharmacy tech. Good, challenging work, kept very busy."
bad,"Don't recommend this company, unorganized with poor management and low pay zone"
bad,"Always puts profits before patients, no breaks, long shifts and hazardous working conditions."
bad,"I worked at CVS Distribution in Fredericksburg,VA for nearly four years and I can honestly say that I have never worked for a more disorganized and poorly run company in my life. There is little to no interaction between the management teams of the two shifts, nor is there any responsibility taken for any mistakes or goals not being met by anyone, hourly employees included. It is a plant that simply tries to pass the blame onto the next shift. The upper management team is in shambles. The plant is in the process of going to an LMS/WMS system, so growing pains are to be expected, but instead of training or moving those who cannot keep up to their standards (which are based off a different DCs numbers, not this ones) they simply fire them regardless of seniority. This warehouse is being run into the ground and will probably not be there in 5 years which is sad because when I first was employeed there, i actually enjoyed going to work. Now with the possibility of being fired on any given day looming over every employees heads, it is more stressful that it is worth."
bad,"High turnover of management and employees, work/life balance is minimal, there is little to no sense of value and more culture of replacing employees with whoever may show up for a job interview."
bad,"You get paid an okay amount to be a technician, its very hard to move up and earn more money with this job. Not much room for growth. Benefits are rarely good and co workers (in my experience) have been okay to work with."
bad,I love the job but there has been 4 managers since i started  less than a year  they want you to work like you are 3 people and pay you for one  the PTO and time and a half for holidays are the only great things about the company
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers.  If you have a great location the store is awesome. The customers treat you like family, it is the best part of the job."
bad,They don't pay you well enough for all that you do. They have you doing the job of 4 or 5 people but getting one salary. The don't  give adequate raises.
bad,You will work hard and may or may not get noticed. It is stressful and fast paced. Sometimes unfair and sometimes unbearable. there are good days but also bad days
bad,The only person that should seek work as a Pharmacy Technician is someone who is planning on furthering their career in Healthcare. The stress from the sheer amount of customer service and low pay is not enough to pursue this position as an actual career.
bad,"I love working with people but this job will make you resent your co-workers and hate dealing with the public. CVS in general is understaffed, so you are expected to cover multiple stations all while dealing with customers asking how come there meds are not ready, customers get upset and they have a right to be upset. Dealing with b.s insurance is the worst."
bad,"The work place culture was excellent didn't care for relocating for another store to gain more hours, and couldn't make a living with the wages that I made. I"
bad,"-new company restrictions leading to unethical behaviors"
bad,"If you can handle being yelled at by customers all day everyday then this is the perfect place for you! Most of the pharmacist are lazy & rude. The hourly pay is the lowest pay rate possible for a certified pharmacy technician. Unfortunately your coworkers aren’t always nice, they hate their job so much that they’re just evil all day. Management doesn’t know anything about pharmacy so that’s a joke. Worst place for someone wanting longevity but great for someone wanting to gain experience & anxiety!"
bad,While this job provided me with many of the skill sets I need in today’s work force it was not a great experience working there overall. Customer service is tough but the customers at cvs were just RUDE and sort of entitled. Not to mention there’s always something wrong with their systems which made it more difficult to provide service to customers. The coupons are an absolute nightmare.
bad,"First things first I have been for a year now and it has been the biggest joke of an employer I have worked under. I own my own business and work here for extra money during off season and the first thing I noticed is none of the systems are intuitive or user friendly. Rather than actively try to improve things they prefer to refer back to how bad things used to be and avoid optimizing their systems. Each team and each location does everything completely different and it causes a lot of conflicts when filling medications  on time or giving benefit related services or info. No one here seems to really care about the member or their job. It's all based around shoving the blame off on other things, people or departments. Integrity and self accountability is a very rare occurrence. They swamp their reps with back to back calls but slow computers and systems make keeping up with calls correctly and with minimal stress nearly impossible. Resource Planning incorrectly skills people causing other people to have either needlessly high call volume while some have 2 calls a day. They just did a company wide shift diff pay cut to all those hired on from the past year and are hiring on the next reps at 3 dollars more currently than what they are paying everyone else. Management and supervision is very cliqueish and cut-off. Very rarely do sups here care about their teams and instead just use them as a stepping stone to further their own careers. Reporting wrong doings of supervisors is often retaliated against as well either directly through threats or increasing ones discomfort at work."
bad,"Once your day starts, it goes by at really fast rate, you are always doing something it could be assisting customers or putting stock away. The other is taking continuing education for your job title."
bad,Honestly if you are a person who constantly wants to me CVS pharmacy is not the job for you. You have to have patients to work here because not only with the employees but with the customers.
bad,"It would be a good job for someone who does not enjoy a challenge or creativity in their job. The upper management (district manager) didn't know what was going on most of the time. You also have no choice when it comes to where they send you to work. I was hired in, then transferred to a store 78 miles away and told I had to go or would be passed over for a promotion."
bad,"I truly loved working here; the people I worked with are fantastic, and there’s nothing like the feeling of belonging when you socialize with your regular customers. The pharmacy is always busy and provides an excellent challenge, but the hours available are really limited. The store overall is usually understaffed, and the expectations put upon the colleagues are at times unbearable. Every year, the corporation expects more from less."
bad,No home life.  Repugnant supervisors. And just blah. If someone calls out everyone else is screwed. Supervisors cannot miss a shift. Boring job. The coworkers and customers are good
bad,"Work was too easy, I learned a lot about how to deal with people and stay positive, Management was good, the workplace could best be described as toxic, the hardest part of the job was being stuck having to serve a customer while watching under Qualified co workers mess up the work you were doing previous, the most enjoyable part was helping out customers with difficult problems."
bad,"For an SMIT, the pay was ok I guess, whether you’re in the Pharm or FS, it’s only about numbers. ONLY! "
bad,"Rotating management door, fire long time loyal employees who earn too much and zero reciprocal loyalty from upper management. You will be expected to work your tail off for a tiny paycheck."
bad,"Loved the work. The bad things was you never knew when your work day would end. Maybe a six hour shift, maybe 10-12 hour day. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians."
bad,"Corporate makes schedules shuffle so you can't set things up to make everyone happy. "
bad,"My experiences with CVS were typical retail pharmacy issues coupled with understaffing, long hours, and unrealistic expectations of what can be accomplished in the amount of time allowed."
bad,"This is a fast paced working environment. This is the perfect placement for someone whom is self-motivated, open minded, able to multitask and not require constant supervision.  The employee must be able to stay focused, be detail oriented, confident with redirecting customers, and stand during the entire shift. The work schedule is not consistent and requires the individual to be open to any availability during hours of operation."
bad,Very challenging environment due to size of the organization and constant innovation. The size of the company and nature of the industry requires significant procedural efforts to mitigate liability exposure - making for what can be a restrictive environment for personal/professional judgment and expression.
bad,If it’s not the most understaffed company in the world I don’t know what is -  as the store manager it will take you at least six days a week to run the store  with most shifts being 12 hours -  CVS is one of the most greedy and uncaring companies I’ve ever encountered -  you will not have work life balance and you will always be miserable because you will always be at work
bad,"As shift supervisor I would make sure the store retained tidy via front-facing and stocking.  I would help customers locate items and assist at the register as needed. If on a closing shift, I would gather all the registers, including the pharmacy, to be counted and make the nightly deposit."
bad,"CVS is nice in that you get to work with some nice colleagues and meet some cool customers.   But the company is like any large corporation.   You are a ""number"" and not treated as a valued employee.  The district leader will come into the store and point out only negatives.   Never have I heard any praise for the positive contributions.   In addition, labor hours are so minimal, that it is almost comedy for the expectations placed on the crew and manager.   It is comparable to a ""Bully"" mentality in many respects."
bad,Training for Store Management sucked under a manager who was no longer interested or a team player. Went from 8hr days to 14hr days and once worked 14days straight with long days and no breaks even to use the restroom because short staffed worst management job ever.
bad,"They do not care about there staff"
bad,CVS is always re-inventing itself. It is more RX driven than Front Store. Front store is transitioning to a wellness center. Payroll has always been a challenge with the highest SPLH in the industry.
bad,"Very little raise every year,25 cents to 50 cents per hour raise,they don't care if you can make enough money for living,they don't really care about their employees."
bad,"CVS is a fast growing company that cannot keep up with the way the industry is growing. Senior management has no clue as to what is happening on the ground level and continues to make knee jerk decisions without being fully informed. As someone in management, there is no opportunity for growth and HR has admitted that CVS is on the bottom of the pay scale for all positions."
bad,"Not employee friendly. The have a storage room for breaks when you can get one. If hired part-time, they claim you are not guaranteed hours, so they will cut your hours at will. They could care less whether or not you have rent to pay and long as the customer is given the kitchen sink."
bad,This job is always understaffed and focuses way to much on the business and customer service aspect than the healthcare aspect. It’s very stressful and the company doesn’t care about you.
bad,"Pharmacy too small to have enough staff working at the same time. Open 7 days a week, very hard working team that I would work any where with but upper mgmt. didn't understand our CVS is very different from most other stores."
bad,clock in and go to the front to check people out. If no customers then do go back or stock up your section with merchandise and help customers on the floor when you see them.
bad,They excepted managers to work long hours and sometimes open to close for meet the needs of the business so they didn't have to pay hourly associates.
bad,"Always short staffed, bad benefits, low pay. Long shifts without breaks. Company cares only about scores, which don’t reflect true customer service. Threatens employees with write ups."
bad,"Compensation is pretty great especially at higher levels.  Culture is lacking.  Politics interferes with ability to achieve great results.  Leaders vocally promote value of accountability but enact punitive actions when performance is missed.  This leads to posturing and blocking of real facts to executive level and in-fighting at the lower ranks.  "
bad,"Although they have given employees significant raises last year, the hours have significantly decreased. If you are full time do not expect a full 40 hours. It could be as little as 30 hours weekly. On top of that it is continually too busy with not enough employees to keep up."
bad,"It was management who never wanted to help the Pharmacy, was ridiculous. No matter how busy we got, we would not receive any help from the front end ."
bad,"After purchasing Aetna, budget cuts have left all stores in rough shape. Managers who were already working 50+ hours are working 60+ hours if they want their stores to run successfully. Technicians and pharmacists are worked at too high of speeds which are unsafe for patients."
bad,"Training is very good, but still lacks in time.  Actual job is very stressful, almost no callers are nice.  Everyone that calls has an issue with their medication that Caremark is usually the culprit of the mistake."
bad,"very hectic, high script volume pharmacy, great for learning, with super huge lines at pick-up and drop-off,doing over 500-600 scripts per day, suitable  for people who like working at busy stores"
bad,"This a fast paced call center. The overall atmosphere is relaxed, but they do push you to sign members up for Caremark's services. Your rating and review depends on how well you push services. Your success depends on your supervisor. I did great with one supervisor and when a new one came in I was suddenly considered failing at the job. So, your success here is at the mercy of your supervisor."
bad,Percentage system they have is a joke. Once you think your almost at your 100% one little hold up and you’ll drop drastically. System will be faulty and will tell you your doing 40% when you have been going the same pace and also will go to 140% out of no where. My advice don’t leave your stable job if you have one you’ll get let go for anything.
bad,"Most days you will work 10 hours or more, but in the orientation they tell you 8. It is fast paced because you are on production, but at the same time you cannot put the wrong product in the totes or you will get written up.The pay is okay, but management is poor and they give you misinformation all the time, such as when you will get off work. Be prepared to work Saturdays too, and they will tell you one day in advance."
bad,"Need better pay for pharmacy technician, I've seen a lot of my colleagues being favored just because they were there longer. Most new techs quit within a month or two. Pay is low for how much we do."
bad,Cvs pays their tech 1/3 of what the pharmacist make and the tech primarily keep the pharmacy running. Without tech there would be no Cvs! The pay and raises suck for them to be merging with Aetna and alway making money moves.
bad,I can get played more to process food in the same state with no training. In the pharmacy I handle people's life's and get barely over minimum wage. Compensation is a joke for pharmacy technicians in retail. Not worth the effort.
bad,"It has been quite awhile since I worked there, so I do not think it is fair to judge them now.  I do not know anyone that works there now.  I was not happy there, but things may have changed."
bad,"Liked = Work Environment, People (Staff and Customers)"
bad,Expect for staff to work long extended hours and then when it is time for movement within the company they hire outside the building - not sure how and why but they do
bad,"I work in the Prior Auth Dept. Which use to be rewarding, now is just a futile exercise in how to promote people based on a stat sheet with zero knowledge of how to actually do the job. "
bad,The are ok/Customer service is something to think about. They dont work with you.The Company it self is not a bad company certain people where ver rude to work with.
bad,CVS is a good company to learn how to be a technician if you are a fast learner.  Most stores do not have the hours/manpower to properly train (OJT) their techs.  Be forewarned that it is a HIGHLY stressful job/company to work for.  The higher-ups are more concerned with numbers than with actual customer care.
bad,"We were bought out by CVS for 2 years and already things went downhill. No reward system, metrix is too high, no job security if you are over 50, too much micromanaging, no reason to trust the company, the company is about doing more with less."
bad,"I didn't have a great experience at CVS Health.  During my interview I was told training would be 7 weeks which seems like a lot but for doing this type of job it's typical and I was perfectly fine with that.  When the first day came they told us training would be 4 weeks, 2 weeks in the classroom and 2 weeks on the phones.  I felt a little uneasy about this because again, there is a lot to learn and I wasn't sure we would be able to get all the training we needed.  We didn't.  Not only that, the training is all done virtually.  My training class had 42 people in it and we had a trainer who worked from home and everything was done on the computer.  We called a training line everyday and spoke to her in a chat.  She was a great trainer but it was hard to focus because all the people in class would be talking and screaming.  We didn't get much practice with the computer systems due to how short training was.  None of us felt comfortable after the classroom training was over which was a Friday.  The following Monday they made us get on the phones with no more practice and not even knowing how to use the phone system.  They taught us the basics and threw us to the wolves essentially.  I didn't feel right about this because this job involves peoples life sustaining medications, and because we didn't know a lot, it didn't feel right that we were forced on the phones to handle medications.  They had people standing around to help but there were so many of us that they were never available to assist us and the patient became upset, with good reason.  What should've been a 5 minute call"
bad,We were always short staffed and asking for a day off was almost impossible.  We only had 2 technicians total and it got to be too much. They were not advocates for family/life work balance.  Also the pay was extremely low for the experience  I already had.
bad,See Ratings.  That says it all.  Focus on numbers continues to increase while the focus on patients continues to decline.  Too many moving parts and not enough support staff make it difficult to have relationships with people
bad,Very stressful due to lack of labor support. The company is too big and has lost its ability to relater to its work force. For the last 12 years they have stripped the retail sector to pay for other acquisitions. This has been happening for 12 years or so.
bad,"The day is focused on its four prescription runs a day. Two in the morning and two in the afternoon. One run is for the out of town deliveries the other is in town. Typically your morning starts printing labels and finding the correct medication to go with them and filling as listed on the label. The pace here is pretty quick and you are not allowed much time for anything else. If you needed office time to make a schedule you would have to find time yourself to get it done. That would mean cutting into the run to find time for e-mails, scheduling, communicating with managers, coaching staff, conference calls, and doing your assigned learning that CVS requires you to complete on a timely manner."
bad,"Working at CVS call center is all about the numbers. You are rated on several different activities. You must maintain your hours with a time clock but also with your computer which basically means you have to be two places at once. Sometimes one is extremely far from the other. You must stay on point with your interactive computer schedule as well as the time clock. Start times, break times, lunchtimes, meeting times, coaching times, times on one type of work or another at various times of the day. You also get a seven minute bathroom break a day which also has to be entered into your schedule and don't t take a weekly total over a 7 minute a day total. Your amount of time off is also on a numbers system. If you are 6 minutes late they count it as a half of a day off. So if you are 6 minutes late 4 times in a year and out sick three times you are then put on a warning. You then have to take a specific number of calls daily and get judged for that. This includes how long calls are lasting, time between calls and call totals. Then your calls are reviewed on a numbers system with points for various areas of the call being evaluated with numbers which must come to you guessed it a specific number. So you must achieve a perfect numbered schedule, a perfect numbered call amount within a perfect number of call time, and perfect review score on your calls all while perfectly completing your job. Well at least you only have to maintain a 95% average to account for the times you are running from time clock to desk or desk to bathroom. So accommodating. The system is very poorly developed"
bad,More concerned with making phone calls than filling prescription orders. More concern about scoring metrics over actual work being done. Too many programs going on at same time.
bad,"This is a young person's job who doesn't have much to compare it to.  Compared to other positions I've held, this was the least satisfying job I have ever had."
bad,Pharmacists are expected to work overtime every day and are not compensated for this effort. You cannot plan any appointments in the evening because you never know what time you may get off.
bad,"Omnicare was bought by CVS. All of the upper management left the company, and they now have an entirely new management team. This team does not know how to run long term care."
bad,This company does NOT care about their employees. The president of the US gave a very nice tax break to companies. CVS Health did NOTHING for it's employees. It's all about PRODUCTION and not the patient's and the employees who work hard everyday.
bad,Very stressful environment non appreciative of pharmacist and upper management would like to be recognized for job well done instead of non acknowledgemebt
bad,"Long hours, non-stop work and ridiculous metrics to achieve. No matter how fast or efficiently you work there is always more to be done and it is never good enough in the managers eyes."
bad,"I applied and was hired for the role of Clinical Services specialist (CSS) during the interview management only gave the job description of a CSS and nothing more.  When I was hired I never received any CSS training but was sent into the IV mixing room to train as an IV tech.  No questions asked and was pretty much sent there without any say.  I was with the company for 11 months and never got the training for the job that I was hired and applied for.  Management needs to be honest in the ""Additional responsibilities of the Pharmacy Technician – Clinical Support Services"" section of the application description.  the pharmacy manager's motive is to hire for 1 job but then will tell you that she wants to ""cross-train you"".  You will NEVER leave that IV room.  The only thing I miss about that company is the pharmacy techs and Pharmacists that I worked with."
bad,Constantly watching back. No loyalty to employees but you have to give them everything. They don't tell you when things are good only tear down for bad.
bad,"Highly stressful, especially when hours were continued to be cut, leaving the managers to pick up a lot of the slack and be able to complete tasks in an unrealistic time frame. On top of that, corporate would add new programs, but not take anything away so that the work just piled up. All of this and they expected perfect customer service, though the number of employees that could be scheduled was not enough to give the best customer service."
bad,This company refused to effectively communicate between departments and everyone was refusing to accept responsibilities for mistakes that were made. Despite openly trying to fix issues they said whatever was needed to move on.
bad,CVS is all about their money not their people. The company is about high profit margins and not their customers and it shows with the quality of people they hire.
bad,"poor management, employees are dispensable and not relevant."
bad,"Cons: First and foremost, it's like High School. Everyone's in a clique and if you're not a ""popular kid"" it's hard to move up in that agency no matter how GREAT you are at your job. Management is a joke. They have their favorites and NEVER say anything to them about the job that will rub them the wrong way because you will have a target on your back as long as you stay with the company. They want you to be ""Famous for Service"" yet their GOALS are really unrealistic. If you want to be ""Famous for service"" it's like you have to choose. More money or make the customer happy. Its either help the customer to the best of your ability or meet the expectations (goals). We deal with VERY sick people who NEED their medications so to me going above and beyond WHEN YOU CAN shouldnt feel like a punishment. "
bad,approve schedule for staff and present training and rules and regulations. work well with coworkers and ensure state and federal regulations are upheld throughout the pharmacy.
bad,The lack of pay you get to deal with the customers and employees. Starting at 9.50 dealing with customer always angry about the drugs when it's the insurance. The lack of pay for having to deal with everything on top of doing everyone's job because there're lazy.  This job is w as y to stressful for the pay.
bad,"If you work in the pharmacy, you are generally treated as an over-qualified, yet underpaid cashier. Very stressful environment, constantly have to multitask 3 things at once, while also having to drop all tasks to assist people, and answer phones. Everything is timed, Benefits need to be fought over to get, and vacations are often denied anyway, due to staffing issues. Pay is extremely lacking in addition to all this. You are required to get certified to work in the pharmacy, and despite all the duties, and qualifications needed to work this job, you will be paid close to minimum wage. I was paid more to wash dishes with only a high school diploma prior to this job."
bad,"Where do I begin? You are expected to get everything done as fast as you possibly can, but you are not given the resources needed to do so. A great example is that my role relies heavily on making calls out to other places to resolve issues. For well over a month, I have come in nearly every day being told I cannot make those calls out. The list of accounts I needed to work on kept growing, with no resolution in sight. In addition, other departments I rely on are not available when I need them most. We are critically understaffed and I am often asked to work overtime even though I am clearly burned out. Management does not seem to care for the health and well-being of its employees and does not recognize that the level of stress they put on employees is affecting our health."
bad,I worked for CVS Caremark for 2 years and was significantly underpaid.  I worked 70 hours a week on average to maintain descent income but had low work/life quality because of my working hours.
bad,I liked my job duties at the store. I liked the store manager a lot too. I learned a lot and had fun at the same time. The store was organized and efficient.
bad,"Worked there for three years then the company had a change where it went from caring about it's employees to not. Now they just laid off 12 workers with just a two week notice and these are people who have worked for the company for 3+ years. If your young and need a soild employer, there not bad. But if your trying to stand on your own feet, this company will cut you down for self improvement."
bad,"Working at CVS mainly feels like its a job that can and will likely be replaced by a robot. Many times the same issues can be found across the board with insurance issues. The amount of paper wasted is astronomical. To print a single label for a bottle you need to waste a full sheet of paper. The layout and interface feels incredibly outdated. The pay is honestly not livable with. Raises happen yearly, but are so minimal it makes it feel like they are purposely doing it as low as possible. The best part of my job is that it is incredibly easy to figure out who makes a mistake due to the personal daily credentials."
bad,My pay was 10k - 15k less compared to some of my coworkers doing the same job. I thought that my annual bonus would make up for the difference in pay but the last 3 years (2015-2018) only 60% bonuses were paid out. The hours expected to work were insane some of the time. The best part of the job was being able to work from home twice a week and when my kids got sick so that I didn't have to use up all my PTO except I never got to use it.
bad,It was a hard company to tradition to but overall the pay was okay and the management allowed people to train for better positions. Overall a good company to work for depending on your position.
bad,"Worked there for over a year and you get underpaid and pharmacy managers are constantly being replaced. Training was poor and support from coworkers to teach you things is minimal to nothing. You get thrown out there to learn everything on your own at your home store. Luckily there is a hands on training process you have to go through for 2 days before you enter your homestore, however, thats all you get."
bad,"phones ringing off the hook. people in drive through, drop off and pick up with not enough staff to cover during rush hours. hardly got lunch breaks and had to eat on the run"
bad,"At the CVS pharmacy I was working both evening shift and morning shift.when I was working there , I learned lots of things. For example , how to provide a  good customer service. Also I learned that how to greed a customer at all the time.That's what make us to bring more customer to the store.I really enjoyed working  at that company."
bad,Very concerned about the bottom line vs patient care. Would get lectured by management if patient emails (used for store card- no effect on their prescriptions) were not captured at time of them picking up their prescriptions... pharmacy coworkers were not treated like the healthcare professionals that they were. Company seems to be more focused on marketing instead of improving patient experience. Always felt like I was herding cattle in the drive-thru instead of taking care of the patients. Salary was well below average.
bad,"The training was cool, that’s the only thing I liked. They were strict about EVERYTHING. You would get a point for just the stupidest thing. They really didn’t train you so if you don’t have call center experience don’t apply, they throw you to the wolves. Calls were a variety, supervisors and the call resolution team weren’t too big of a help. Very stressful environment."
bad,"A good place to be employed if you are in school. Raises, wages, and experience will leave you wanting if you don't constantly push for improvement. Good managers will encourage ALL of their employees to move up and better themselves. That being said, your experience greatly depends on your outlook, the store that employs you, and your management team."
bad,"I will be willing to discuss this with my future employer. I don't want to write a review on here. If my future employer wants to know about my experiences at CVS, then I will discuss it with them"
bad,"I would not take back my time at CVS, though I would not want to relive it. I learned an innumerable amount of skills including quick customer service, management of patients insurance information, and a vast amount of pharmaceutical knowledge. I worked at three CVS pharmacies in my area, sometimes all in a single day. I started to get 'burned out' toward the end of my time there after working 33 twelve hour days straight. I felt some of the practices my supervisor encouraged were immoral, including refusal to offer patients in financial difficulties manufacture coupons for certain medications. I was openly scolded and mocked by my supervisor for trying to help less well off and elderly patients find ways to bring their medication costs down."
bad,"A typical day working in the pharmacy is very stressful and demanding. You have to fight between work hours, patients insurances, pleasing customers, and limited amount of workers on a day to day basis."
bad,"The supervisors dont take up for the reps and are constantly finding ways to get more money out of you. The environment is relaxed, however they are strict about the dress code."
bad,"Supervisor called me for interview ,which I really appreciates. "
bad,"Working at CVS pharmacy you will see that management and anyone above does not care about the employee. All they want is for you to push additional services as if you are going to be compensated for them. The hours fluctuate and you have no set schedule. Lead and managers play favorites giving some employees more hours based on this. There is no accountability for bad behavior from Coworkers such as calling off with no notice, arriving late, or leaving early. Customers yell at you for issues with the system that you have no control over. Only work here if you plan to be stressed and not know when your next day off will be because oh yeah schedule is supposed to be posted 3 weeks in advance but expect to be notified about your schedule the Friday before your next shift on Monday."
bad,Overall I wouldn't suggest working as a pharmacy tech at CVS unless its short term. The entire hiring  process takes about a month before actually working a regular day. Training involves  modules and on the job training. My base pay was 11/hr and  was given a raise of 12 cents after 3 months. Breaks are 30min if working more that 6 hours. This would be a great job for a college student  trying to purse a career  in the medical field.
bad,"Started at CVS when I was just a kid, it was a good place to start a pharmacy technician career, but not the kind of place you want to stay."
bad,"I worked for CVS for 3.5 years and received very little in the way of raises and little opportunity to move on from my position. "
bad,This job is very stressful. Management is always saying one thing and changing their minds the next day. Rules and protocols always changing. Like a production job and you don't have quality time to talk with members. Terrible place to work!
bad,"I have been working at CVS for about a year. I work from home. I applied to WFH.  They constantly throw in your face what a privilege it is to work from home. If you don't make goal. (yes...you have a goal to ask customers to sign up for their website)  they punish you by sending you to work at the call center for 30 days. if you don't go to break on time, they punish you by sending you to the center to work for 30 days, Bottom line. Everything is based off the needs of CVS.  If you had a call center job then you know the deal but if you're used to working in a family oriented organization,  then I do not recommend working here."
bad,"I worked with them over two years between front of store and pharmacy. The job is very fast paced, customers only spoke Spanish, the senior employees obviously didn't want to be working there any longer and got away with coming in late or no call no show, and low pay to get yelled at. They cut hours a lot too and may take you off the schedule completely like me so have a second job lined up in case."
bad,"Very fast paced environment that you must learn quickly to keep customers somewhat satisfied. It is the medical field and many people will curse at you, throw things, yell, and report  incidents to management. I had a front store worker call the police on my car because it was parked outside while I was working. My manager was furious as i was but  coporate did nothing about it. "
bad,"A typical day at CVS would be to ring up customers, greet them. Most of the time it was understaffed and they expected me to do a million of other things at once. I was rarely able to take my breaks because of the amount of work I was given. "
bad,"Titled supervisors are useless and questionably competent. At the department level, management is excellent. There is no opportunity for advancement, and the turnover rate is high."
bad,"Long hours some positions don't even know when they are leaving, don't tell you when you work Saturdays until sometimes that Friday NIGHT. Strict on being late for any reason can be fired on the spot."
bad,stressful and fast paced environment with low wages and awful communication to employees. upper management does not show much interest in giving raises or support.
bad,"Everyday is different but working here was not only hard but stressful. Had good and bad vibes with coworkers but majority of the time, it seemed like it was reliving high school all over again."
bad,You need to know people in order to excel and advance with this company. My co-workers themselves were great and friendly but management has their own way of doing things and even if you are exceeding expectations if they didn't pick you then they will make you choose to leave
bad,Not a horrible place to work if you are just looking for something to get by. There is a large disconnect between corporate and lower management. Very low compensation for cashiers and clerks. Low budget hours for expectations of the job. Always short handed due to employees calling in because they have very low motivation. No real lunch breaks for supervisors even though they want you to clock out for lunch but are still required to respond to supervisor calls.
bad,"It is just not where I want to be working for CVS,because they do not train properly and the high up management does not care about there people working for them."
bad,"Management is not the greatest."
bad,Always running around like a chicken with my head cut off. Didn't feel welcomed to the team. Very stressful environment. Used to love the job until I switched locations.
bad,"The customers were amazing and learning how to fill prescriptions and bill insurance was great, management on the other hand seemed to be very heartless individuals."
bad,Good company to work for but not managed well.  Fast paced working environment with a good staff for the majority.  Very physical job with not much room for advancement.
bad,Not a good place to be right now. Management has changed.  Very negative and not really focused on quality but quantity.  No work life balance and they do a survey every year about how important it is to complete it but nothing changes.  Benefits are HORRIBLE.  High deductible for medical and pharmacy benefits.  Not really good discounts at the CVS stores even though you are an employee.  Just not a positive place to be.
bad,"I completely enjoy my job interacting with nurses at the facility. I also like my schedule. The management there are very inconsiderate of their employees and do not try to accomodate people's needs. if the Mgmt there were to ever change,it would be a good place to work"
bad,I woud never recommend anyone to work here unless yuo are in desperate need of a job. They have poor management who show favoritism. they belittle their employees. their policies are inconsistent.
bad,CVS in my region is currently experiencing a lack of payable hours to technicians. Low hour amounts per day but high amount of days worked without off
bad,I've learned that customer service is very important aspect working as Pharmacy Technician. There was a lot of times where the customers where satisfied  and there were times where they weren't. With this being said we provided customers with a path to a better health and made sure all their problems were taken care of.
bad,"Over worked and underpaid its a revolving door they can't keep people here, they treat you like children instead of adults...always recognizing faults instead accomplishments... Boring and dead environment no fun atmosphere at all.... The point system sucks they do not offer sick time you have to use a point if you're sick which could possibly end in termination depending on how many points you have(10.5 and you're out)....management needs to be revamped"
bad,"very poor training for tasks (passport photos, photo kiosk), management not open to concerns of employees, poor corporate support for situations occurring in stores, empty shelves, stores dirty, inadequately trained personnel, non-english speaking personnel not held accountable for their positions, inconsistency in accountability of following company rules"
bad,This job is good if you have children for example because you can work every other weekend and on weekdays between school hours. It takes a long time for you to receive the amount of hours you want though.
bad,"drove long distances with own car to deliver medicines to homes and nursing homes but the pay wasn't very good. hard on my car, putvalot of miles on car and spent a lot of money on maintenance of car like tires and oil changes"
bad,"Nice place to work,  loved my job and the co-workers were great.  I learned a lot of new skills and procedures that I never knew before and how HR really operates"
bad,I have been with the company for some time and I can honestly say they do not care about their workers. I feel as though they look at us like we are all disposable
bad,"Looking for another job. Working dealing with very difficult customers, having to multi-task beyond reason. The morale is very hard to keep the team in high spirits"
bad,"The burger needs to be served hot, I didn't enjoy that specially because we are dealing with people's health and not just food. Wish they could value their employees more."
bad,"Understaffed is something you're going to always have to put up with, not ideal at all. Having your hours cut to less than 15hrs a week if you haven't been there for at least a year is also something you'll have to put up with."
bad,"Always working short handed , Management was terrible didn't care about there employees. was diverse ..Nice part of the job was good co-workers . Hardest was keeping up with production."
bad,"Great place for students who live at home and don't rely on income to cover any major expenses.  If you're lucky enough to get an understanding manager, your schedule can be worked around.  However, if you're looking to earn a living or if you have other major commitments, this may not be the job for you.  If you don't have flexible managers, you won't be able to get much done in your personal life.  And with the pay, you can't afford more than your absolute basic necessities."
bad,The management was made a big deal of the most trival issues.  The work enviornment was stressful and it didnt have to be.  I left work drained every day.
bad,"Work/life balance is horrible at CVS, but this is expected as they are notorious for this. Compensation is ok, but you have be forced to relocate or commute for 2+ hours per day."
bad,Usually short staffed and treated like you work for a fast food company. Although your working in a medical profession and under paid. What makes it a decent job is your co workers
bad,"A typical day a CVS Pharmacy is always fast pace from the moment we open our doors until we close. There is always a constant movement going around, whether it is helping people at the registers, or drop off window, or answering telephone calls. To be able to work in this environment, one must know how to multitask and problem solve in a timely and efficient matter."
bad,"I have been with this company for 6 months and being laid off in May. I have learned about Long Term Care Pharmacy so that was a plus, my training was not done well at all. Working here is almost like being in high school, people are catty, two-faced, and very unprofessional at times. I thought I would be doing myself a favor by starting at Omnicare, but this location is poorly run, and it feels like a day care at times, our location is closing soon but I am looking outside of the company for future employment."
bad,I love my coworkers and customers i have fun everyday at work i only wish i could get more hours and the company had better opportunity for advancement.
bad,CVS Health in 2017 is not doing well.  It was a strong company but has taken too many risks which is resulting in poor performance.  The stock is taking a hit because of that.  I would not recommend CVS Health at this time.
bad,"The job itself isn't difficult, but it is often unbearable due to the lack of resources to do your job.  Management has too many meetings and not enough results, completely incapable of providing the easiest solutions to the problems.  Instead, they come up with ineffective solutions to motivate employees, which do not work because of the easiest solutions not being explored.  When new and good ideas are given by employees or lower level management, there is rarely any buy in from upper management, but when upper management pitches ideas to benefit their numbers to the detriment of the associates, those ideas usually stick.  There is little to no job security due to the suffocating mass of policies and procedures, and some functions receive blame and lose good associates due to management's inability to find proper root causes to problems."
bad,After a year of never calling out and trying my best I only got a .14 cent pay raise.  They don't want to give anyone full-time or over-time.  Worked for another company that appreciated there employees and treated everyone much better.
bad,CVS pays very little to their store employees and expects a lot in return. The biggest factor when working here is whether or not you have a great team of coworkers to work each day with.
bad,"Most managers are out of touch with how their employees feel about the work environment. They are so worried about meeting their numbers that district and regional bosses make. Pay is minimal and raises are even more minimal. It's sad this corporation is so greedy. Minimum of 2 people on each shift, theft is high cause the theives know the cameras are the pits and where employees are.  It could be a good company if the CEO and his staff came and worked a week in the front retail part of the store. If your not the store manager plan on working alot of weekends and afternoon evening shifts. No such thing as an anonymous complaint to HR. Managers always figure out who made the complaint."
bad,"This is a quick paced job requiring delegation of drop-off, production, and pick-up to facilitate work flow. Medications need to be filled and dispensed in a timely fashion."
bad,This company isn't very strong at developing people. Management gets moved around about 4 times a year if not more which makes growth difficult. Talent is not a top priority.
bad,"The reason why they're always hiring is because no one stays for long not because of the little pay, but how workers are treated. CVS and other stores need to raise the hourly rate and actually care about their employees. Make your workers happy and you will get a better and happier employee who's willing to give their best."
bad,"I've been with the company for a couple years, it has had its ups and downs, however I am looking to move forward with the knowledge that I have gained since I started."
bad,"If making good money is the most important thing in your career, work here. If being happy, appreciated, respected and secure with your position at work is more important, don't even apply! Management is awful, turn around is scary and the place is not organized or professional at all. They don't even have a branch manager! I don't know how they are still in business!"
bad,Good PTO and dental and eye benefits were affordable. Overtime readily available. Poorly managed and constantly understaffed. No place for advancement and low rate of pay.
bad,I enjoyed working with this company and they did a lot of things for the communities like they had a coat drive for the kids and a food drive as well.
bad,CVS requires alit and do not pay employees enough to carry out the million duties staff already has to completed. They all about numbers no interested in employees.
bad,"Shifts were long upto 13 hours at a time.  The people that I worked with were AMAZING.  The Pharmacist in charge, the technicians, store clerks, and store mangers were all caring people, for the most part.  They appreciated each other and took care of what needed to be done.  However, our management team kept changing.  The supervisors barely kept in touch or spoke to us.  We saw them when they needed to review something...and we usually would get negative feedback more often than positive encouragement."
bad,"A typical day at work is very hectic with lots to do with minimal help. If multi-tasking is your ultimate passion while constantly being interrupted, then this is the job for you! Your day is what you make of it, and there are times that you may see those that you work with more than your family, so you need to be a person that likes other people. All this is no surprise because Retail is Retail where ever you go. So let's just say it is not the BEST place to work, but they pay you every two weeks."
bad,CVS problem is that it is to big on the numbers.  How many RX's you did this week or how many customers came through the drive through in the last month.  It made the job stressful and not fun at all
bad,"I have done this type of work for 4 years at a similar company in 2005-2009 and was not treated like I knew anything, and that is more than 20 words."
bad,I learned a lot at this job.I like working there but I don't like how you work a lot there and not get paid enough.The district manger will never appreciate your work but always complain. They expect  a lot from you but give nothing back to you
bad,"sorting books magazines on shelves, learned alphabetically how to sort those items. co workers nice helpful ,job had nothing hard about it, nice to get opportunity from job placement agency."
bad,"CVS is a very busy pharmacy. I enjoyed working with most of the pharmacists and my coworkers. The customers made me smile. Helping them was fun, you never know what they will say."
bad,"A typical day at work as a pharmacy manager:"
bad,Heavy workload with lots of metrics and high turnover of technician staff .Low pay for technicians equates to low retention rates.
bad,"Always ask the employee hard working, many module to study, good customer service, but  cheap payment. They can not give you the stable hours, compared to the other pharmacy, CVS is more busy and cheaper payment."
bad,"Alright place to work, but the days can be very long with either very short breaks or very long breaks, the pay is good and everyone who you work for are very friendly and hard working, unable to plan anything around rotas as they get changed all the time, unable to have a social life around the rotas as well."
bad,"I only worked at Omnicare for 10 months. The first few months were great until I was hospitalized and forced to miss 2 weeks of work. After that my coworkers, including my manager, belittled and tormented me. I went to HR multiple times and they said there was nothing they could do. The people would rather gossip than do their jobs. The place has terrible communication issues between departments and no one is ever on the same page."
bad,I disliked working at this place because they ask you to do so much and want to pay you the lowest. I worked the night shifts and they still gave me minimum wage
bad,I refuse to review this company. Nothing much to say about working here. I liked it. Then I realized it was time to move on great for a starter position.
bad,"I take pride in being a pharmacist not only to customers who get prescriptions from my CVS but also those in need of recommendations for OTCs. I am Indian but have taught myself enough Spanish to be able to effectively provide recommendations and prescription counseling to my patients. Unfortunately this is not an aspect of patient care CVS is looking for, rather they are in need of pharmacists that can verify hundreds of prescriptions without providing counseling or taking a break. I am looking to place myself in a pharmacy environment that actually places patient care as its priority as opposed to solely looking at performance through metrics. I am fluent in Hindi as well and it has created a much deeper comfort level for my patients that are too hesitant to ask any questions."
bad,"As an equipment operator, you are supposed to get (by law) 8 hours of sleep minimum. At CVS Distribution, they don't care. They work their employees 12-16+ hours per day. And if you're sick, have something that really needs to be done, or literally just can't show up for any reason, they will write you up, no excuses, AND take your bank hours for not coming in. So all the time off you receive throughout the year from working, they will take it from you without your authorization, no if, and or but about it."
bad,"Interesting place to work with some supportive staff members. Mostly, concerned with providing high customer service and technicians meeting daily numbers. Managers are caring, but are under the constraints of upper management. All in all, you have to be a fast learner and most of all flexible with your schedule."
bad,the needs of the patient are more often times set back do the amount  of corporate requirements and production numbers. the state and federal pharmacy requirements are stalling enough to keep track of much less the corporate requirements.
bad,"This employer is a Long-Term-Care Pharmacy. I originally applied here for an open position as a Medical Records Technician, which I have been trained in during my college program as a Medical Administrative Assistant. I was ultimately hired, but was not given the chance to work with Medical Records within the position that I had applied for. Instead, I was hired as a Pharmacy Order Entry Technician, which I do NOT have any prior experience, knowledge, training, exposure, or required licensing for. I was promised training that would enable me to learn the essential job functions, but the training that I did receive was less than adequate. I was terminated for ""poor productivity levels"", although I was never given the training that would have increased that productivity margin. Another issue was ""mandatory overtime"", almost on a daily basis. Rather than hire more new employees who are already experienced, they make employees work very long hours on a regular basis, thus making it very difficult to balance a healthy lifestyle outside of the workplace."
bad,"I had gotten this job after working for the Port Jefferson Ferry, since it's only a few blocks away. I got the job almost right away, and was told that it'd be part time. It was pretty basic, your average Cashier and Customer Service job. During this job, we were set up at the Cash register with down time un-packing totes for inventory, emptying garbage, cleaning the store, and putting up sale signs. My co-workers were very nice, and helpful. My supervisor at the Port Jefferson store was very supportive."
bad,The way the pharmacy operates is different than how you are trained it will operate and NOT in a good way. Co-workers are typically unfriendly.
bad,"The head pharmacist is rude, disorganized and  relates too much on the tech to do the job and doesn't help them when they need help. the overall management of the pharmacy is really awful. the schedules are over the place you never know when you are working. The level of communication between the staff and telling information to all employs is not good."
bad,"I found this job to be something that only few could do. A typical day was answering and speaking with 30-50 people a day in regards to issues, questions and irate customers. Once being there for a while you received some offline work, however its a constant busy environment. No bonus or commissions, hard to move up if its not Quarter 1. Absolutely horrible communication, even from one side of the building to the other."
bad,"A typical day of work consists of mainly ringing up customers the whole day. I learned to type prescriptions onto the CVS database and that people will treat you badly if you have a weak demeanor. My workers are helpful at times, but no one like to that initiative. The hardest part of the job is to get the medications out on time knowing that you have hundreds of other patients to serve in Drive-thru and the front counter. CVS is mainly about the numbers and figures... the company does not value the employee or worker that helps generate the billions of dollars. CVS stresses to value the customers at all times.. but no respect and appreciation is ever given to the tech.. In addition there is no room for advancement, expect to lead technician which is same thing. There is no clear policy on raises either."
bad,This job was a decent job while I was staying i that city. There was nice coworkers. Just not a large amount of room for advancement.
bad,"Turnover rate is horrible.  Outside management does not care.  Short-handed on staff to be so busy.  Just cares about the money, and there is a whole lot of money in drugs."
bad,"I would of liked a more organized training course. I was not really challenged. Overall not that bad of a place to work for, it just was not the right fit for me."
bad,"Corporate CVS grades each store based on performance. When a store has low performance, the technician's hours get cut."
bad,"At CVS I learned how to work in a fast paced, moderate stress environment. I have experience with every type of customer there is. This really helped me grow as a pharmacist. All in all it was an excellent experience. I thank CVS for allowing me to serve my community."
bad,"I help people every day. Filling they're medication, helping them with any problem that may occur, and making them happy."
bad,"Entry level Pharmacy technician work. Triage calls, fill prescriptions. Customer service"
bad,"With this typical job there is always work to be done. This job has taught me a lot about working in a pharmacy. I've learned how to do compounds, fill prescriptions, refill prescriptions, fill control orders, etc... My co-workers are very nice, helpful, and hardworking. I can't really say that this job is hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a lot of hardworking individuals."
bad,"Great benefits, everything else is ok. Most times schedule can be adjusted or varied hours if needed. Also only  tech and pharmacist on weekends in most stores which is horrible."
bad,"Poor management, no direction, blindly led infrastructure. For instance, they have had 4 CEO's in 5 years. Can't keep people in office. Has high turn over rate. Has little job security"
bad,"busy day in and day out I spent majority of my time at a register than actually counting medication. I learned to just be patient and that the customer is always right and to not argue with customer. poor management and disrespectful, The lead technicians would try to over step their boundaris and forget that the HPIC (head pharmacist in charge) is the boss. Co-workers seemed a little to messy and would try to get a little close with your personal life instead of focusing on training technicians to improve in their weak areas on the job. The hardest part of the job would be getting the long line down at the register and the most enjoying part of the day would be getting off and going home."
bad,"Retail is a difficult place for anyone to work. Sometimes the public can be rather difficult and it gets hectic often. Management never took the time to ask each store what they needed to succeed. They would come around to the store every now and again, even if your store was excellent by the numbers, and tell you what things were wrong and what you were going to do to fix it. They didn't offer any suggestions or took the time to help fix the issue. They did not care if it was busy or what else was going on they just came in to tell you what you were doing wrong. They only wanted their bonus for the year and worked hard to get it and made sure you were doing your part to help get their bonus. Also, they were never very knowledgeable and couldn't answer any questions on any of the new programs/updates coming out."
bad,"Loved the challenge, but there is a high stress rate in the company.  Many stress leaves and high burn out rate.  Too many 60 hour work weeks being the norm."
bad,"It was an okay position receiving calls from members about their medication however most of them were very grumpy and rude. I hated answering the phone because there was so many disgruntled people. My supervisor, I won't say her name but was terrible. She has no expression and she was extremely rude, she never answered her line when we needed anything, was never interacting with her team members and could care less what is going on in work and outside. She shouldn't have been a supervisor in the first place. When I stopped coming to work, she did reach out to me which was the first time she had every reached out to me. The company itself was good, I just wish I had the oppertunity to move up like the others. I did put in a request that went no where."
bad,Working for CVS is a hard job.  Never ending work load.  Bottom line oriented at expense of employee.  Scored Job metrics.
bad,"My duties include working the bi-weekly A/R for Caremark PBM and Prime Therapeutics, along with other pharmacy benefit insurances making sure that claims are processed in a timely manner and all rejections are resolved resulting in correct payment for Caremark as well as patient responsibility that is the better benefit for the patient. This is completed via email and verbal communication with account managers and the clients until the account is at a zero balance and claims are processing correctly going forward. If problems arise keeping my superiors updated every step of the way."
bad,"not so friendly"
bad,"As a customer the employe's were never nice, and as an employee my co-workers just overall didn't have welcoming attitudes."
bad,"A typical day would be multi-tasking between providing customer service by greeting customers at the front door, and assisting them at the cash register and photo center area, while scanning in shipment with RF unit, and putting up stock from truck on the shelves"
bad,The job is fast-paced and you learn alot right away from failure and mistakes to get better. Your co-workers my be motivated if you are and you help work as team. Hardest part of the job is doing so much in little time with little help around. Most enjoyable part is helping someone who really needed help.
bad,"I came to Caremark through CSI Staffing agency in December of 2013.  I was brought in for the Remediation team Caremark was forming.  Due to my ability to learn quickly I was asked to help the QA Department. Now that the QA department is fully staffed I am being moved back to Remediation. I am searching for new employment Caremark has decided not to continue with the "
bad,"Typical day at work involves balancing a managerial struggle between PIC and store manager. Balancing responsibilities between patients, work loads, and telephone calls with minimal staff on hand. Hardest part of the job is no time for any breaks and obstacles preventing the completion of any one task."
bad,Lots of changes taking place with Omnicare.  Lots of people leaving the company.
bad,"Once a great company to work for, now has lost touch with their employees.  Pharmacists are pressured to meet ""numbers"" with limited tech help and no breaks.  Compensation is a average and benefits are decent but its high stress environment with no appreciation from management.  Vacation requests are mostly not approved regardless how far in advance you request them.  One is expected to work all the time without consideration of personal time off."
bad,"A typical day at work includes being on your feet for at least 7-8 hours. The pace is extremely fast and includes working with the public, insurance companies, management, inventory, and budgets. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers that are screaming at you for something that is not your fault and keeping calm and cool. The easiest part of the job is keeping inventory down and ordering stock."
bad,They pay virtually nothin. They don't care if you quit or they have to fire you. They have a ridiculous turnover rate so no one really knows anything.
bad,This was a retail dept that was always very busy and staffing was always limited for co-workers
bad,"A typical work day for me usually starts  off by me having trouble getting out of bed so early in the morning, but a cup of coffee or a red bull always helps that problem. Music on my morning commute to work , and some breakfast when I do have time for breakfast, I enjoy working in a relaxed work environment with co- workers so are just a upbeat as myself and very personable , I like making the work place fun all the time, because lets face it people sometimes work isn't always an A+ day. The hardest part of the job for me would  be to go home not accomplishing anything I like to get in and get out but knowing that I did my job well and my work was well appreciated from staff and my management team. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the work place does have that down time and myself and staff just got a handful of people that were in the lines in and out , we would always laugh about that at  Cvs/pharmacy because its located right near Fenway park, its always busy usually and we would always make games out of it to see who can ring the fastest being in the front in as a cashier, its the little things like that , that make work enjoyable for me."
bad,"CVS, like most retail pharmacies, have relatively high paying salary with great benefits. However, its continuous budget cut has led to decrease in hours for pharmacy technicians and pushing most pharmacy staff to work to exhaustion. Having little to no time for breaks or rest due to good programs designed by the company with poor implementation. Poor implementation of such programs are mandatory and are measured against an unrealistic standard. Such implementations has caused demoralization of staff and high turnover rates within the company."
bad,"-Extremely busy due to only one CVS location in the town of Rosenberg, TX"
bad,"A typical day at work is exhausting, set up for failure every day.  I have learned the more you do the more people expect until they are expecting the impossible. Upper level management only care about numbers that in no way reflect the job you actually do. My co-workers work hard and are easy to get along with we all make a great team.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get work that would require 10 or 12 people done with about 6 or 7. I enjoy the customers and my co-workers very much and will miss putting in my heart and soul to this job."
bad,"Fast paced , very busy. day flew by. I did learn alot there. And was always willing to learn more or go into another part of the pharmacy.  at this location there was overtime due to if you worked the night shift it  never got out on time. which was no problem . had a good group of people i worked with then. we produced and got it out."
bad,I didnt work there long enough to get a good perspective.  the location is nice though if you like working downtown.
bad,Working in the pharmacy has it's ups and downs. The pharmacy requires accuracy and working quickly for sick customers.
bad,i started here when i was old enough to take the tech test. The pay sucks! there are far more companies out there that will pay you  higher than cvs. its a good place to start at and build up experience but you will soon get tired of all the drama that comes with cvs. i worked at one store in houston and that store had 3 turn overs within a 6 months span. the upper management sucked as well.
bad,"High call volume within a stressful environment. Customers often will call in angry or upset. It used to be a great place to work, but management has changed too much. They are in the process of changing our benefits, demanding more, and not advancing in pay. It is hard to get requested time off, even when you have accumulated and available vacation days."
bad,Management is more worried about driving numbers than actual patient care.
bad,Working as a pharmacy tech taught me to work as a team. The job can be very busy but rewarding. I have learned a lot working in this field.
bad,"•Responsible for the preparation and making of prescriptions."
bad,"Poor employee compensation, Job very enjoyable, staff great, poor pay."
bad,Typical day:
bad,I have learned a lot regarding coding and analyzing claims. I have been given the opportunity to train others on the procedures for the assignments. I've also been given the opportunity to lead a team. My co workers are amazing individuals; they are what make coming to work worth it. They keep the environment light but in a professional manner. Having fun while getting the job done is how I like to work. The hardest part of the job was that I did not know what to expect when coming in from day to day. There is hardly any structure.
bad,"A typical day at work is very busy, and includes a lot of multitasking. I get along with all of my co workers, and enjoy working with them. The management is very nice, and is very flexible with schedule. The hardest part of this job is dealing with customers because at times you get blamed for a lot of things that usually are not our fault, and the customers get angry but we have to keep calm and deal with them the best that we can. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with my coworkers."
bad,"Bad management, far drive. Low pay, no benefits. Horrible schedule"
bad,Constantly changing carriers we underwrote on behalf of and to whom we reported. Very frenetic and stressful environment.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the peer support. Good tools provided by company. Unfortunately, the work-life balance is totally out of wack .Long hours. Difficult to plan for own life as you are expected to be available at a moment's notice. Compensation is only low to average for comparable positions. A lot of internal bickering. High turnover. Friction between management and staff with unprofessional and disrespectful conduct toward workers."
bad,This job teaches you discipline and order because of confidentiality and HIPAA laws. Prepares you for your next job.
bad,I enjoyed working with my coworkers. I enjoyed the job also.
bad,"Friendly easy going coworkers, however working conditions drasticlly declined(budget cuts were made and employee salarys were reduced, major adjustments to company work hours with no explaination)"
bad,"All phone consults recorded, timed and randomly reviewed monthly. Ablility to help patients not valued as much as how fast you get off the phone. Good place to work if you need to sit and can tolerate a noisy call center environment."
bad,I learned a lot about pharmaceuticals and pharmacy practices
bad,"Job can be fun and easy. However the pay is minimum, there can be a lot of work to do or sometimes it can be very easy if you are on the register."
bad,"I was living to work, only guarunteed 30Hrs/week and sometimes had to pick up on-call shifts for more than 30H. Worked 14 hour shifts without breaks (inc. bathroom!!). Reprimanded by management for eating an orange slightly in view of customers (sorry, not allowed to leave pharmacy....). Weekly reviews of meaningless parameters-- none to to do with actual patient care."
bad,"it is a very different work environment , they have good work hours but not alot of hours to give. Great discounts on ther brand supplies"
bad,They have no consideration of anybody and there personal life to work here you have to be available when they want you to and if not then your forced to get you hours cut and find other stores to work at It’s very misleading that they’ll help you and care about you at all.
bad,"They are there to make  money. Prescriptions are ready for patient pick up maybe 35-40% of the time.  I worked there as a ops manager. Not a day went by that I didn't receive a customer complaint. Usually about the pharmacy. Upper management doesn't support good customer service suggestions,not open to change,instead cares more about pushing employees to talk  people into signing up for Carepass, instead of improving customer service"
bad,"The job is the easiest I have ever had but the corporate continues to cut hours and add impossible goals."
bad,In short words it’s a job    You work and you get paid has it’s goods and bads  way under staff and have to work for two people   This company pretty much you have to be one of the favs
bad,"I worked hard for this place and I was bogged down by not so great management. It's great to have to do the work of a store manager, but never receive the title of one."
bad,"I should  have read previous experiences from others before  accepting  a job there. Pay it's okay, you better be proactive to learn on your own than rather wait for training. Poor work/life balance."
bad,"I was a tech writer at an advisor level for 4 yrs. Pro: I learned the PBM business. Con: HUGE setback professionally in that co is very cheap & won't spent $ on technology, new software, outside training & professional dev, etc. Trust me, I fought for it. That means 4 years of technological & software advancements have passed me by - and that's a lot. Having recently left, I'm suddenly behind where I should be & am  scrambling to train myself as I seek new opportunities. I'm upset I didn't wake up & run out the door sooner. Along those same lines, pay, bonus, & advancement is .. typically a source of disgruntlement on the employee survey (as is what I just mentioned). Senior management was meh, but employees were excellent, which always surprised me, given the drawbacks. Employees may not stay that long, but we/they care about the customers/members while we're there. Anyway, I can't truly recommend for those reasons."
bad,Working at CVS was exciting and fun in the beginning but as time went on they started to care less about front store and cut the hours and expanded the amount of work required to get done
bad,CVS health is a great company to work for for. They have a lot of benefits if you are able to get full time. The pay is exceptional and has really good discounts.
bad,"Cvs is caring more about the pharmacy its self than the store but then wants to have it open with little to no staff. If you're not rx your job is not safe. I was both but in taking that role they will schedule you front store shift and expect you to be in the pharmacy, while also yelling at you for not finishing your front jobs. My store was very  unsafe and never had security . The cops gave up on us and just told us to carry... CVS cut hours and then left cashiers alone for entire shifts. They can not keep a manager in the store bc of the lack of support from higher up. There have been 4 managers in 6 months at the one by me. I loved my direct manager but she also had no support and it was just her and I 60 hours a week..."
bad,"Problem areas that directly affect the work environment were not addressed on the corporate level.   These included primarily lack of warehouse space, inadequate security, and insufficient hours.  This location was not typical of CVS locations in general, with more challenges than a typical CVS would face, but the company didn't really do anything to improve these areas to make it a productive and safe working environment."
bad,"CVS does not truly care about their employees like they say they do. If they did, they would not make their pharmacists work 12-13 hour days with little to no tech help and no designated lunch break thus forcing a lot of pharmacists to work all day with no break."
bad,District managers will say yes stay for 6 months on this position and then we will hire you on Upper level but they just keep delaying it because of too much politics. Education background doesn't matter.
bad,"It was a nice clean building predominantly women workers which was a little clique ish. If you were not in the in crowd you had no chance to advance due to not being known and it was based on popularity not merit, skill or experience.  I was new to Florida and knew no one so i was already an outsider to all the friends in the company."
bad,"Since corporate cut the hours at CVS, it has been extremely difficult to fulfill all that is asked of us.  Prescriptions are behind schedule every day because there is simply not enough manpower."
bad,"A typical day was always very busy.  I learned to multitask and still do an excellent work.  The workplace culture was variety, but everyone was treated with respect.  The hardest part of the job was being very busy, all customers wanted to be attended, and just trying to be as quick as we can without taking out being careful was the hardest part.  I definitely enjoy every part of it, I like helping people and pharmacy gives me that opportunity and at the same time as a challenge but I love it."
bad,"I enjoy people I work with, but I don't get the hours I'm supposed to get with my position. Management needs to improve and so does the company. I enjoyed working here when I started but, it gets overwhelming, tiring, irritating and makes you not want to work for the company anymore"
bad,"I did not get to go to additional training because I was told that I was “slow and my mind wasn’t at work “ "
bad,Wonderful team.  Had an AWESOME manager but he ended up moving locations. Our district manager had never worked in a front store environment only a pharmacy environment but he made all the call for front store which weren’t always the best. I was trusted with the deposit and all the money but another manager and I were accused of stealing drinking out of the coolers. HORRIBLE loss prevention management and district management.
bad,"Very strict way of doing things, must be friendly and willing to help customers at the drop of a hat. Not a career kind of job, in my opinion. Strict dress code. Not great pay."
bad,"Lots of advancement in Store Level positions, anything beyond that is next to impossible to get. Pay was great but benefits were lacking as most insurance plans were high deductible plans. 401k was very good and is probably the single best perk. 5% company match. Long working hours little payroll, weekends and nights required."
bad,"They don’t care about employees at store level. Managements tactics for employees is threatening their jobs. Not a leadership, more of a dictatorship."
bad,"Great company until they cut all of their full-time techs down to 30-31 hours a week. It looks great on paper to say you make $17 an hour, but at 30 hours a week, you still make nothing after taxes and insurances."
bad,Culture changing to more medical and not retail closing more stores soon job security not there. You are a number not a person and too many metrics to try and report as well as hard to get to all targets.
bad,"Unless you are in an 80-120k week store, you are working with manger and a cashier in the morning. At night you have a manger and 2 cashier's. A DM once told me the front store doesn't matter to the company, they could close all the front stores and run just Pharmacy and be very profitable. The front is just a convenient attribute for our patients."
bad,"Originally they were focused on customers but that changed. Poor work management, and client care. It was no longer a nice place to work.  Company driven by greed and not customer care."
bad,Keep in mind small box retail environment.  Very challenging if you run a 24 hour store.  Be sure you have your phone in the room for overnight callouts.  Very physical job so be prepared to work additional hours to work truck and seasonal sets.
bad,"I initially was excited when I was hired at CVS. The training process is lengthy. They put a lot of time into the hiring process to make you feel welcomed and get a good idea of the company. I was excited by CVS rolling out healthy alternative snacks and not selling cigarettes. They also seemed to have a focus on heart based interactions. Unfortunately I never met anyone truly passionate about working for this company. A lot of people stayed for the financial security. The higher management put a lot of stress on its store, often criticizing performances, demanding higher and higher goals, while not increasing the resources or help needed to achieve these goals. What would benefit this company is hiring full staff so there is ample coverage to meet goals while providing excellent customer service. Also, the coupon ""trap"" I find to be obnoxious. Often it leaves people stuck in a never ending cycle of needing to get the ""deals"" and creates a more competitive + sales focused environment. I didn't like all of the coupons. I also felt CVS could do away with selling so many cheap or even harmful products to its consumers. A plus to this company was having a lot of benefits+ good pay."
bad,"Everything is on you, there is no real training. The focus is solely on the shareholders not employees. Employee hours are cut to the point the store managers have to sometimes work alone or just in general work in exess of 60+ hours in order to get the work done as they can't go over allotted payroll hours. The moral from the various locations has declined."
bad,"More “retail” rather than health care - the company cares about their numbers- not the people. They cut employees hours, they hurt your paycheck- you’re constantly working with short staff & overwhelmed because all the company does is cut hours. Staff is beaten up by negative reviews that weigh more than positive reviews. The company has changed in the past couple of years & it hurts the employees in the stores who are loyal to the company for years."
bad,"Flexible hours, pay is decent but the culture is horrible it’s all about who you know. Management is horrible and the environment is like high school. People fighting all the time and lots of “slang” used instead of normal communication which is annoying sometimes."
bad,"Culture changed to a much more structured environment....Hours reduced, but more and more tasks assigned...Higher ups encouraged associates to ""report"" on others...Not a good environment."
bad,CVS is an OK job to have. But they don't pay enough and they are always cutting hours! No room for advancement unless you are a Pharmacist. They are constantly expecting more but they do not like giving out raises!
bad,"It used to be a good company but  now district manager are greedy.  There used to be ot,  room for advancement,  now you have to suck up if you need to get anywhere. Used to get merit raise now its like your asking for the world if you do ask for a raise. Used to get acknowledged when did good work now its manager favorite. Bad company to work for don't bother if you are looking for a career."
bad,Its a nice place to work. The employee there are very helpful in training. The benefits are very good. I enjoyed working there but your hired as full time but only get 32 hours sometimes 40 hours.
bad,"I worked at Omnicare CVS Health and while my time there was fairly short, there weren’t many perks. Very cliquey (much like high school even though most employees are grown adults), favoritism, hardly any room for growth and the wages you are paid for the work you do aren’t worth it unless you were grandfathered in from Omnicare. Probably depends on what department you’re in. Their computer system is very outdated. Strict point attendance system. The managers I had were cool and pretty relaxed, but the above factors did not make it worth staying."
bad,The pay is what keeps many pharmacists at the company. The work environment is extremely difficult since the payroll is extremely limited. This forces the pharmacist to do all the work even in the high volume stores (>2100 rxs). It feels like a pressure cooker and the focus is predominantly on the negative.
bad,"Extremely stressful job with mandatory overtime required. Pay doesn't compensate for stress level of job, poor health insurance benefits and duties required. No additional compensation for time and travel expenses to train new hires. The managers are approachable and assist if employee desires to move up the corporate ladder."
bad,"start with spreadsheets that had jobs on it that needed to be completed by the end of the day "
bad,"This company is good for 1 thing intro to working as part timer while going to school"
bad,"There is limited place for advancement. Salaries are capped, regardless of productivity and increased revenue. Constant loop holes to avoid monetary rewards. "
bad,"Company cares only about making profit, not it's employees.  Will cut hours and make you work without enough help causing a hostile work environment. Always stressful and they offer no help."
bad,"It has been absolutely ridiculously busy lately and instead of getting help, our hours get cut. We can be 20+ pages in the production queues and upper management acts like it's our fault. Everyone in my store is amazing and helps even front store but they are the only reason I'm still there. Honestly I'm looking elsewhere for employment. I can't take it anymore, getting yelled at for being behind, no help, it's exhausting."
bad,"Poor training , need more training felt it was a rushed halfway training. It wasn’t a horrible place to work, I was lucky to have had amazing supervisors ."
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy technician many years ago.  At the time, the pay was not very good, and there was little room for advancement.  The pharmacy was often understaffed and therefore, the employees overworked."
bad,"It's a greedy corporation that does not care about employees. They only care about making money and making employees feel miserable, If you do get a promotion with more pay they balance it out by cutting your hours and sometimes sending you to other stores because they do not have the ""payroll"" to do it. The only good thing about it is that sometimes you have good management, but most of the time it doesn't matter when they try to do to help you because ultimately it's always up to the district manager and they're all greedy and the reason they cut the payroll is because they get bonuses on how many hours they save."
bad,"If you like to sit all day without moving, then this is the perfect place for you.  If you like to listen to people complain all day then this is the perfect place for you.  "
bad,"There is no such thing as a flexible schedule. You are not valued as an employee, you are just a number and are expected to make your job the most important part of your life. Everything you do is based on a metric and no matter what goal you reach, it’s never enough."
bad,A typical day at CVS is very fast paced. You must be able to muti-task. I enjoy working with my co workers and being able to help my customers on a daily basis. I like problem solving with insurance situations. There are days when it can get a bit hectic in pharmacy which can get a little stressful. Must always maintain a good relationship with coworkers an customers. I'm not going to lie it isn't easy some days. I have been at this company for almost 16 years. I really could use a change.
bad,"As a pharmacist, CVS is stressful place to work in part, because the corporation does not provide adequate technician support.  You get no lunch break."
bad,Everyday is a challenge. You have to learn to multitask . The management  suck NOT a good roll  model. Always showing up late. pharmacist is disrespectfull.
bad,They only care about how much money they are saving.
bad,"A typical day involved filling prescriptions, supervising my"
bad,"I am grateful that CVS gave me my start as a pharmacy technician.  Six months after being there the lead technician fired several techs and then quit herself.  Leaving me and 1 other technician to carry the load.  Not long after that, the Pharmacist in charge quit and therefore there was no management and lacked in help. I was rapidly educated to take on the lead technician role, which I can only hope that I did a good job.  Though I was thrown into a position that I didn't think I was prepared to take on, I should thank CVS for showing me that I could overcome anything that was thrown at me.  As a single parent at the time, being overworked with no compensation made for a stressed out lifestyle. I was underpaid for the position that I held and took on more than other technicians whether they were leads or not.  The staff that I did have were wonderful and felt deeply grateful for the work they did. I had no direct supervisor (Pharmacist in Charge) for at least 2 years and the district manager rarely came to our store. Hopefully things have changed since then."
bad,"They spend all their money on customers in pharmacy and leave the front store with barley enough hours to run the store, how is a busy store supposed to get anything done if they are only 2 people working there in the middle of the day"
bad,My departments management was great. I did learn a lot and made decision with little supervision. Workload was very high and jot security was very low.
bad,Quick turnover between managers. They were not able to be flexible with my work schedule when I was a student so I had to quit. The bathrooms were not very clean either.
bad,"CVS will usually pay the most among the retails chains, but you will be expected to do much more work. Everything is measured by metrics and will be lectured weekly by management."
bad,"Modern pharmacy company that is innovative with technology to get patients to fill as many medications as possible. Overall after having worked for the company for 4+ years, I realize it is mostly a greedy company to get as much business as possible and employees are overworked. The salary of pharmacists is fair, but we pay our best technicians pennies compared to our competitors. CVS needs to invest in the health of its own employees and compensate our technicians and interns more. There is great turnover rates and lack of training within most stores."
bad,"Definitely lost all the family feel of a small town pharmacy atmosphere that we had previously! Not much understanding from upper management in regards to customer concerns, unfortunately."
bad,I really liked working for cvs as long as you know what to do it will be an easy job. You must be patient and very friendly to all customers and be organized.
bad,You have to be able to multitask to get through the day. You have to be able to do the job of 3 people. They are always short staffed. They don’t care about their employees and they give very low salary options. Not much growth either.
bad,"The pay is low, not much room for advancement and stress is astronomical. Really the only good thing is the other employees. The company sees its employees as disposable and is not willing to work to better the environment of the stores."
bad,"CVS is the most stressful company to work for in pharmacy but it pays the most so if you can handle it, take it. Managing a pharmacy is not nearly worth the extra $2/hr you are given. As a manager, I regularly am required to put in at least an extra 10 hours of work a week in which you are not paid for, not to mention the mandatory meetings and conference calls you are required to attend with no additional pay. If the meetings fall on your day to work, you are required to find your own replacement, work a makeup shift to hit your hours, then attend an all day meeting for free. You physically do not have time to do your job properly (and I always had the fastest rate of checking prescriptions), Customer service and patient care always suffer. Sales driven. However, you do put in so much time that the company becomes like family...and there is always the pay. Also, not much time off."
bad,"NO real room for advancing, low pay. the only good thing was the benefits. Enless you were friends with the manager, you would not get promoted. The pay was also very low, not competitive with other stores."
bad,Very tough culture more pint the finger and blame other then working together to get the solution.  Management has a tuff job with such a large company but does not seem to see the culture down in the trenches and at mid management level.
bad,I was there by an employment agent and was not they were closing. ended up staying a month and management was hiding in their offices. I was disappointed with the employment agency that sent me there.
bad,"Management only cares about numbers. Anyone can get hired as long as they can answer a phone and read a monitor. Training is extremely poor, leading to horrid customer service and really upset members."
bad,My site was one in which it closed and reopened. A pharmacy acquisition took place and our growth doubled in 6 months. The company had no plan in place to staff us to meet our new volume.
bad,"patient safety and improvement of medical circumstances placed under very little time frame, short staffing for implementing of  drug dispensing, employees keep arguing with one another"
bad,CVS is a great place to work if you are a young person and do not have a family life. They do work with you if a problem comes up. When something does not work for them some of the bosses will give you a hard time and so your work day isn't so pleasant.
bad,"The job itself is not difficult. The Management is what make working for CVS a drain. The turnover rate is extremely high because many of the case worker in the department feel under valued and overworked. The management consist of no leadership at all , there is no encouragement. Most case workers consist of newly graduate law student working to take the bar or newly graduated college students. the life span of the position is about 6 mts."
bad,"stressful work environment, multi-tasking under stress while making sure patients are getting correct medication. understaffed, need quality technicians. no time to take lunch."
bad,"CVS has been an a great experience, but I chose to try to move forward in my Pharmacy Technician career.  I've been in retail pharmacy for a long time and would like to venture into other options in the Pharmacy."
bad,"Great benefits,the management staff is nice,but the pay sucks here its not fair most customer call center get paid more than 15 an hour and this the only call center i know gets pay 13.50 an hour they expect for you you to learn all these call queues but dont want to pay you much."
bad,The day would consist of 4-5 staff with an entire store with a truck full of product for us. 1 or 2 would be out taking pallets out the truck and 1 other would break it down and put it on a U-boat. 2 or sometimes even 1 would take it and bring it to the isles they belonged in. After they would stock it up and bring what is left into the basement. Breaking down boxes was unsafe since we had a box press with no safety instruction. The staff is mostly over worked and paid 10 dollars by the hour. 1 employee would do 3 other jobs before he/she could finish their own. Since it was my first retail job I learned that not all stores are managed well. The hardest part of the job was the consistent movement of one job to another since the manager would always instruct us to without completely finishing our initial task. The best part about it I would say is the laid back staff.
bad,CVS askes for unreal achivements daily. Managers are always adding task to complete  in time frate that you barely completed the first time. Traning is mainly computer led. CVS in so many asks you to complete these on your own time.
bad,I and my fellow technicians have a heavy workload and face regular high amounts of abuse for customers and are not paid anywhere near enough for it or provided benefits.
bad,Very high stress environment where your every move is tracked and graded. Expected to work alone 40 to 50 percent of the time.  No vacation for part time employees.
bad,Too many nonsense metrics. Constantly cutting technician hours.  High demand on doing more with less help. No recognition for quality technicians. Micromanaged.
bad,"They work you to death, the atmosphere was good, but they want you to basically give your life up for very litttle pay. Your doing the work of a store manager for the pay of a regular employee"
bad,They have Mean Managers & Employees. The Owners are also Mean to employees!!  Would Not recommend working there. Night time employees get by with murder
bad,"This is a retail Pharmacy. they care about one thing, money. Not your health, not their patients health's. BOTTOM LINE ONLY, people. If they did care about their employees they would be willing to compensate them well. This company has lost more good technicians than I can count. Left and right, like rats on a sinking ship. Thing is, they ain't sinking, not yet anyways. They show no regard to actually caring about the community they serve, though they want you to think they do. If that was the case they wouldn't be the most expensive pharmacy out there in retail right now. But the higher ups don't want to hear that. I've met them, trust me they don't care. They have an awful computer system, that they pride themselves on. You want to work with a system that makes everyone envious. Walgreen's has that system! There isn't a person that came from Walgreen's and said anything bad about the system. Why, you may ask yourself, because it's an amazing system! It has spellcheck, it's straight forward and, most importantly, easy to understand! "
bad,"The company only worries about the numbers from surveys, not their employees. Even if you do well on these surveys, all they do is post them in the break room. The managers get a bonus when the front store staff and technicians and earning the scores while making next to nothing. Their 401k match is the only decent benefit they offer."
bad,I really enjoyed the work culture in the beginning but now its changed into a true call center. great for someone who enjoys call center work. didn't enjoy the commute either
bad,"On feet all day constantly moving"
bad,"When I first started it was a great company to work for but as time went on I have quickly realized it doesn't matter how hard you work or how many hours you put in if you are not one of the favorites you will never go anywhere with this company.  Hardest part of the job is when they ask you to identify trends/payer issues and why its happening, you could spend days researching then give them the answer and nothing is done. Then a month or so later they will ask you to do it all over again.  It's a never ending cycle that will never break due to management not doing their job.  However, the perks are the hours and unlimited overtime."
bad,"Every pharmacy manager I've worked with has been exceptional. In all of my experiences, CVS has found great talent in their pharmacists and gives their patients access to professionals who are knowledgeable, kind, and empathetic. However, CVS is not good to work for as a technician. The pay is significantly lower than many other pharmacies. They've drastically cut hours to most of the stores in our county. They fired many of our employees and refuse to let us replace them, making our pharmacy perpetually understaffed and our technicians have to reschedule their life outside of work to accommodate. While the company's idea of providing a great health care environment is admirable, they do not give their employees the tools to actually do so. We are forced to excessively call patients about insignificant things and punished via a star system if they do not comply with our requests (filling medications, enrolling into programs, etc). The pharmacists are assigned many tasks that the technicians are capable of carrying out and pushed to work harder than most of the other pharmacy staff. Pushing employees to do more work in the same amount of time results in faster filling and it is not safe - for the patients or the pharmacist, who is liable. Overall, I like CVS' vision, but I would not recommend working for them."
bad,The company alone is not terrible. Management and customers just get to you and don't understand you are also a person. A day at work for me consisted of doing more than necessary for low pay.
bad,A typical day was very stressful management only cared about quantity not quality . I did learn a lot . It was very diverse. People were nice. Nice helping customers.
bad,"It's a warehouse environment. Slow, don't have to worry about customers. Constantly on your feet. I didn't like it,  because fast pace is what I like."
bad,it was a great job for me to have while I was in nursing school and allowed me to learn about a lot of medications that I now see in everyday practice
bad,"A very numbers orientated company, forgets it's a company meant to better service it's patient. Overall there are a few opportunities the company could work on to better the experience for both the staff and it's patients, but I have learned a lot from CVS and the experiences both good and bad has made me a better technician."
bad,"Management didn't know what was going on. Staffed short most of the time.  High quota for pharmacy techs to enter orders- quantity was more important than quality. Customers dissatisfied and would complain about billing, med errors, etc.  Company did not care about the happiness of their employees"
bad,"Mega company. Allot of levels typical in this type of company. They have major resources to get the job done."
bad,"CVS is a fast paced retail environment......constant moving, multi-tasking, all driven around customer service.  Customer Service is the biggest factor in day to day activities.  Knowledge of customer service, photo, use of Ipods/Ipads, cash management/control, loss prevention measures, coaching and counseling, Drive for sales/profit margin."
bad,"1. They kept cutting hours and expect you to finish everything! "
bad,"CVS is a good starting point, because no experience is needed and you're trained to become a registered pharmacy tech, however it is stressful. I work a high volume store (sometimes 500 scripts a day) and there is not enough hours, and because of the 3 (techs) to 1 (pharmacist) ratio, it puts stress on the technician to multi-task and get it all done."
bad,"CVS Health is one of the worst chains to work for in pharmacy.  You are constantly understaffed while corporate piles on more and more tasks and responsibilities without providing additional time or resources.  You can be the hardest worker, but management doesn't care.  You will work many unpaid hours with no breaks just to keep up and it's almost expected of you.  Techs - not enough of them and they are grossly underpaid.  It's no wonder this company has one of the highest turn-over rates in the industry.  Not an ideal place to work by any means."
bad,"I make more than most techs in this company, but even so, the high stress environment, poor pay, and expectations to have a completely open schedule for full-time employment is frustrating. You are expected to be available any time from open to close and then be available to work weekends. This makes it difficult to make plans. Although many customers are very friendly, there is also a high percentage of rude, verbally abusive, and just plain mean people who come in and regulary and yell at our staff because of rules and regulations that we have no control over. This is a good company to get your foot in the door for pharmacy, but working here long term is not ideal."
bad,Typical call center customer service position. Benefits are good and insurance is great. Other then that this company is poorly managed and uses outdated technology. This is a company that hires contractors and as a result turnover is high. Management will give you more responsibilities and not provide proper compensation.
bad,"Great company to work for but not enough resources at times. No recognition. A typical day at work"
bad,"The hardest part about working for a retail company such as CVS is understanding that it requires you to have a lot of patience with people day and day out. During major holidays and festivities this may prove to be difficult as people want to be in an out of the store as quickly as possible. I have learned that patience is the best way to understand difficult customers and to assist them with whatever they need help in. One of the benefits is the regular customers who make working at CVS more rewarding. "
bad,Over worked and under paid at the particular location I work at. Our location is way understaffed mainly because of disrespectful customers but the one's that do stick around get no recognition or deserving pay increases.
bad,"while I liked the ability to preform my duties as the pharmacist in terms of safely and accurately filling patient prescriptions and providing consultations, the company clearly places a higher importance on pharmacy metrics above patient safety. One would argue that those metrics help with patient safety but unfortunately it isn't something I saw while working for a year in my own store and training at neighboring CVS locations. Meeting the verification time clearly takes precedence over safely and accurately verifying prescriptions. Aside from management trying their best to do what they are being told, I personally do not feel there is a clear understanding from ""higher-ups"" regarding placing patient safety first. While the idea of PCQ calls is interesting and enrolling patient in ready-fill programs sounds beneficial, majority of the medications being returned to stock are those exact ones scheduled for ready-fill. I did however greatly appreciate all the effort my lead tech put in daily to assist the pharmacy team."
bad,typical day at a busy CVS could be described as almost Chaotic. There are simply not enough techs to handle the basic day to day operations. Designated cashiers would really help to lighten tech and pharmacist work load.
bad,"Basically the only perk with this company is the PTO and the flexibility when you need to make appointments, etc. The insurance is good, but if you need coverage for more than just yourself, can get expensive. The pay seemed good at first, but the raises are minuscule and have even been denied company-wide in the past, after the most recent lawsuit wiped out the budget. The better you are at your job, the more responsibilities you are handed...without any perks or motive. It's pretty much ""this person can't/doesn't WANT to learn this, but we know you can handle it, right?"""
bad,"If you are looking for a Company where you can grow, stay far away from CVS Health. They only promote their favorites, the favorites seem to be the lackers. If your hardworking and looking for stability and growth, try another place. Other than that, must coworkers are great and good to go to for help, not the Superviors, well in the department I worked in"
bad,"Starting manager was great , As time moved on several employees quite several different managers. The store I worked at went down horribly. etc.. Their transferring policy sucks"
bad,if you preform a miracle they make it part of your routine. Lots of squats and lifting. Not a lot of overlap to have management discussions.  smoothing the wrinkles and working hard
bad,"CVS caremark is a decent place to work. The shifts vary from 7-3:30, 9-5:30 and 11, 7:30. Management can sometimes be ok."
bad,"I do enjoy my team members, they all work hard to get tasks done that i give them to do. i usually run the store, make sure all projects are done. Such as our weekly shipment. Accounts, and dealing with customer service needs."
bad,"Supporting pharmacological services by stocking, assembling, and distributing medications. Organizing medications for pharmacist to dispense by reading medication orders and prescriptions; preparing labels; calculating quantities; assembling intravenous solutions and other pharmaceutical therapies. Helping health care providers and patients by greeting them in person and by phone; answering questions and requests; referring inquiries to the pharmacist"
bad,"working at CVS Health in the pharmacy, is very challenging, yet rewarding at the same time, because you are helping the sick get their medications as well as giving information on their medications that can help them and prevent any unnecessary medical accidents."
bad,Customer service needs to improve greatly. Employee work schedule of Pharmacy Technician's is not used for customer needs. Many days I work 3-4 hours alone without assistance. Or .we have new Technician's  that need to be trained and not enough time to train due to the business and demands. I continue to move forward and do the best job for the patients. Its hard to give one on one assistance due to staff shortage. I take great pride in my working with patients and helping them with their healthcare issues. The hardest part of this job is that I am not able to assist the patients with the time and care that they need.
bad,"The metrics required are completely achievable, and unreasonable. You are graded based on everything you don't have any control over. Customers are given surveys in their emails, and they are supposed to rate several aspects of their experience on a scale of 1-5. If they give 4 or below for ANY topic, it's equivalent to receiving a score of zero. 5 is the only score accepted. When a customer isn't aware of this, and they give a 4 in order to be reasonable, the entire staff team gets yelled at for months on end from upper management who creates false speculations saying things such as,"
bad,"High volume pharmacy, ridiculous raises not worthy of the name, slave away for little job satisfaction and little appreciation by a typical profit driven corporation. "
bad,"Extremely stressful atmosphere."
bad,"My Pharmacist refused to train me yet expected me to know how everything worked.  Eventually she transferred me to another department without informing me not to go to my next training appointment.  Front end was fine, but they couldn't afford to pay a cashier a tech's salary."
bad,"I used to enjoy getting up and going to work, until I started working with CVS.  They focus more on the numbers and not on the actual customer.  In the last few months, it has gotten ridiculous.  I used to think that I was a great technician, since I've been doing it for over 15 years, but now, I just don't like I can do my best.  Hours are cut, and schedule is made according to what a computer thinks is best for the pharmacy.  Corporate is not liking the numbers/metrics it's seeing, but won't give any extra hours. Everything is micromanaged and it's taking away from helping the customer."
bad,"process and fill prescription orders, provide customer service, handle insurance rejection claims. Company is ok to work for but so much is expected with little to no help."
bad,This job was stressful to me because they don't take doctor's notes and you have to fight for any necessary time off. I feel like I was under appreciated for my strong skill set and under used. This job made me frustrated most of the time. Calls felt very much like working as a telemarketer pushing customers to things that they sometimes didn't need. My coworkers and immediate supervisors were fantastic and made each day a bit better. The policies and upper management of that building were ridiculous and nearly impossible to yield to if you are looking for long term employment.
bad,"The training is dedious and you do learn a lot, there are some good people that work there but voerall it is very stressful. The management is nice but the company is very strict on hours and pay and red tape. It was a good experience but I do not want to go back."
bad,"With two shifts running there are still ten to twelve hour days. Hard physical work. Management is dosen't seem to care about the people who work for them. They say ""Some overtime"" there is always overtime. They say they are for families but no one has time to see their families. with all the work there is no time to get to know coworkers."
bad,I run my reports and work my high dollar claims which are Medicare BFD- Medicaid claims. I train externs when they come into Coram.
bad,"My experience at CVS has been for the most part negative. It's not what I hoped it to be, and some of the people are great to work with not all."
bad,"enjoyed learning new software, and new process of how mail order works."
bad,Very demanding mentally and emotionally. You get the calls places like Humana and blue cross and blue shield don't want. The benefits are the only thing worth staying for. They listen to all calls and grade you on what you said and didn't say. They kind of want you to play shrink to these people.
bad,"Can''t say my experience there is COMPLETELY terrible. The time working there definitely depends on management and individual store goals. Overall CVS as a corporation is very unrealistic in their expectations and focused on the wrong things, in my oppinion."
bad,Company lacks structure across the board. Not consistent.  Good point is that you meet and come across many people that you are able to help.
bad,It's an okay place to work but it does not leave much room for anything else.
bad,"running reports, proofreading the ad and tracking changes. I learned how to prioritize and organize jobs. The management is disgraceful.They allow coworkers to insult, demean & harass others. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changes to the rules. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped prevent an error for another team."
bad,"It can be a grueling job working in the pharmacy as a technician, but the most rewarding part of the job is getting to help the customers get what they need."
bad,"Keyed the prescriptions from doctors"
bad,"The bad thing about CVS is that you work a lot and give all your effort and hard work and the pay is not good enough. Its never enough for them, they always ask for more. There many other companies out there that know and understand that they are successful because of the hard work of their employees, so please do yourself a favor and don't waste your precious time with this company. By the way I am a pharmacy technician, we only get 88 hours a week for technician use and there is 4 of us with the pharmacy being open from 8am-9pm just imagine that..."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Omnicare and the staff were friendly, but the pay wasn't competitive for the work performed."
bad,"I have worked for CVS for 3+ years. I work in a union store so my wages are higher than those of regular no union stores. As a pharmacy tech, I am expected to do way more than I am paid for. I also work for a PIC who is degrading and moody but supervisors do not take employees seriously when it is discussed with them. Co-workers in my store have been there a long time and the relationships formed is UNHEALTHY for all!!  This is my job to get me though college and luckily not my final choice."
bad,Lead technician in a pharmacy with very high medicaid and medicare patients. I do all the inventory tasks daily and schedule empolyees and manage other technicians. I love doing my job and waiting on customers I like a retail pharmacy but also love the medical side of it and learning new things. Hardest part of my job is keeping up with corporate metrics that change constantly. I enjoy the inventory and book work and love my coworkers.
bad,All you do is verifying prescriptions. No time for lunch. Too big of prescription volume for pharmacist daily
bad,"Always had the feeling that we were set up to fail."
bad,"Fill prescriptions, council patients, check prescriptions for accuracy, ensure good customer service, immunizations, check that staff is and stay productive, making sure documentation and recordkeeping is up to date according to company and state regulations."
bad,"The past few years working for CVS makes me weary of the company's future.  The company continues to add additional workload for the pharmacists while diminishing the necessary support staff to help in all the new ambitious endeavors the company is pursuing.  CVS wants to push customer service but at the same time remove necessary components for providing excellent customer service a reality.  Most pharmacies don't close for lunch and all the new policies the company continues to push on the pharmacists are requiring the pharmacists to complete these tasks on their personal time.  With all the tasks, and not enough time in the day to complete them all, customers will soon face the consequences of CVS's ambitions by means of misfills from the pharmacists.  While compensation is considered to be the best in retail pharmacy, I've learned my license isn't worth the risk."
bad,"While the job paid well and offered decent benefits, the environment was far from welcoming or desirable. "
bad,"over 200 scripts per day, lots of running around and multi-tasking, phone calls, data entry, faxing Dr offices, calling insurance for rejected claims, etc. I've learned a lot about the field of medicine and the way insurance actually works. My co-workers we're great most times, but you always have some slackers no matter where you work. The hardest part of the job was telling people in need of meds that we didn't have, couldn't fill it or dealing with a very upset customer at pick-up especially for a problem that you yourself didn't cause, but you have to take care of the team and deal with the situation courteous and professional. The most enjoyable part of the job was most of my regular customers and it felt pretty easy to run the system for me so the actual labor wasn't that hard."
bad,"Answered questions about membership and recent bills. Learned a lot about healthcare and insurance. Management however was horrible, customer service reps knew way more than they did and at one point in time when we had to ask questions we had to raise flags, literal flags. Those questions sometimes got answered. Felt really bad not being able to give correct answers especially since our consumers were the elderly. If you are in a bad spot and need a job go for it they start off at $13/hr, but if you have a good job and want a better one this is not the place to go."
bad,"Typical day at work consists of me reading email for requests from other employees in infrastructure while working on changes to some security controls currently in place and working with employees on various issues that arise on a daily basis.  I enjoy working with the other security analyst and security engineer because they work with me on various projects to distribute the work between all of us.  Management when I first worked there was ok, they had vision, but now with some changes to management, the vision has left the company and employee training and development has been an afterthought."
bad,CVS/Pharmacy is a large corporation that has no regard for anything other than generating profits for upper management.  The company continues to cut resources (technician hours) while increasing unrealistic and often immoral expectations.  The company often wants pharmacists to recommend continuation of unnecessary treatments to patients to generate more profits.  It puts my values as a pharmacist and human being at odds with my job requirements.  
bad,"This is a nice place to work until you are on a project that is considered priority, which happens often.  During that time, they can easily demand 12 to 16 hour days, ""lock ins"", or even mandatory 6 day work weeks."
bad,"If it weren't for the demands of corporate, understaffed shifts, and disgruntled customers I'd be alright with working here. My coworkers are great but they cut back the hours allowed per pharmacy per week and increased our workload with phone calls, paperwork, and customer service requirements on top of all the other administrative work we do."
bad,"CVS- I made PCQ calls to patients that were on new medication; I did the waiting bin report every day by pulling medication that hadn't been picked up yet, I entered the new prescriptions in to Rxconnect, and put in refill request. I verified the status of the customers medicine, and I would check the customers out at pick up and the drive through when they picked up their medicine.  I learned to prioritize my work on this job a lot, because all of our work was put in timed order, so you filled the prescription that was nexted in line based on the time it was due to be filled. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be to fill Narcotic medications and match the patient with the prescriptions that has been keyed in. Using the Pyxis machines, we enter the patients name & amount of the medication to take out, which then is set aside for the Pharmacist to review. We maintained communication with the Pharmacist(s) in other areas such as Order Entry, Triage, and the Floor. The hardest part of the job is to fix the inaccuracies and discrepancies so the numbers of inventory would match - ie, someone would key in wrong amount, etc. The co-workers I have worked with has been with Omnicare for a long period of time, and are successful with their jobs. The management of Omnicare, however, lacked organization and does not distribute work load fairly among the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day, my goals are complete and the patients are receiving their medications in a timely manner."
bad,"I do not recommend working at, or for CVS whether in the pharmacy or in the store."
bad,"come to work and immediately help patients or answer phones after you clock in. You're always doing at least 3 things at once. Typing in prescriptions while you're on hold with an insurance company waiting for a claim to go through, while you're explaining to the Pharmacists which problem prescriptions need His/Her attention first and why. You never get bored... and when you're working with a good team it all miraculously goes like clock work.."
bad,Good learning experience for my background but I was never given any credit for my work or asked to continue full time work with company. Communication between project management and temp team was very poor.
bad,"Between all of their metrics and flu shot and prescription quotas, it's quite easy to become overwhelmed in the CVS culture. Every month stores get a scorecard, and basically it grades everything from how long you take to answer your phones, to your script count and technician budget.... it goes on and on. If there's one thing CVS cares most about, its making money and its shareholders. CVS will do whatever it takes to retain customers, even if they are the most reprehensible individuals the planet has to offer, you will still get yanked around to dismiss common sense and pride to retain solid business. Between this and 14 hour days with no lunch/dinner breaks, it can be incredibly difficult to verify hundreds of prescriptions, handle random questions and assist technicians. That is the reality of being on the front lines working for CVS. Hardest part of the job is dealing with said issues, best/most enjoyable part.... helping the 1 person out of 500 that you deal with every day with a pediatric dose. It's also enjoyable to do flu shots without hitting bone on skinny people. Another thing to note, you may be scheduled till 10pm and you may close the pharmacy at 10pm, but getting out at 10pm is a rare feat (slower stores this is attainable)."
bad,Helping customers and guest is a must been through pretty good learning experiences on catering to a persons needs and wants. Coworkers were great worked very hard and made it if fun to look forward into coming into to work knowing that you would get things done before the nights over
bad,"Caremark used to be a great company to work for. Ever since CVS took over, pay and benefits have been diminishing and skilled colleagues have been leaving in droves."
bad,"Lots of driving, You have to be very likable, Have to pay for any health benefits, managment looks out for themselves, have to work part time for over two years, but have to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week to get looked at for full time. This is a single persons job for the on calls if have family you have to leave any family outing or function to do scripts/call in orders."
bad,"underpaid, no raises, customers are always rude and impatient, minimal benefits, management is never satisfied."
bad,This section of the company is not hiring and I would say is unstable. We were acquired in a corporate buy out from Aetna Insurance Company. No positions are filled when someone leaves or is fired. Most of the employees feel they will not have jobs by the end of the year.
bad,• Skilled in all the aspects of preparation of medication and pharmacy operation
bad,"Clocked in, checked with the manager to see what was on the agenda, and made sure my work space was tidy and ready to go."
bad,long hours
bad,"I enjoyed working with my immediate co-workers and manager but the company as a whole does not appreciate their employees.  Not enough staff to ensure that all work assignments are done in the time allotted.  On scheduled days off, 9 out of 10 times you are called in because someone did not show up or called off their shift.  Not a very good work/life balance and the opportunity for advancement is non-existent.  Again, I did like the people I worked with on a store level, just not the company as a whole."
bad,"Not a very fun place to work for , managers vert mean and not supportive. felt very uncomfortable and was not very happy to be working with other employees."
bad,"Used to be an awesome fun place to work. They carry good benefits, however, employees and budget hour cuts has made this an impossible job to get done properly. Everyone starts back biting, and ensuring their own job security."
bad,only as a last resort should you work here. its a revolving door. they show very little respect to the employees making it difficult to manage your techs
bad,"You'll never fill a script because you're always on the phone. It's like a call center for narcotics. Years ago the company was great, the times have changes"
bad,For many years now there has been nothing but cuts in payroll and job positions. The company continues to grow and grow with continued cuts in payroll and staffing. Do more with less is an understatement. You will constantly be required to reach unattainable goals with no support to do so. The pharmacy technicians mainly run the registers with no payroll for cashiers which creates a poor environment to be able to provide positive patient care or quality customer service. The front store operates the same with only one manager and one cashier in the entire store. It could be a great place to work but they choose for it not to be. Corporate greed for money has put scales over there eyes and created a blindness to see their demise in the making.
bad,Stores are severely understaffed... therefore a lot of the labor falls on Management.You don’t really get a chance to manage a store properly instead you’re running all over the place trying to catch up (you will fall behind). Folks over at DC are clueless and send ANYTHING to stores without looking at your inventory needs generating a ton of unnecessary overstock...
bad,"To work at CVS is to be working for a company that is ran by money hungry pharmacists, that only care about sales and not the front store employees. There will be a lot of pressure put on front store if the pharmacy doesn't make enough money."
bad,stressful environment worked hard and not compensated for it ever day somebody calls sick and you have cover their work and yours  without being appreciated
bad,"Pay is not competitve. There are other companies in Hawaii that pay way better.  For the amount of work and stress levels that come with the job,  we should be getting paid at least waht other companies similar to su are making."
bad,"Working at CVS Pharmacy is not bad and is actually a nice first job. Most of the co-workers are friendly. But I don't recommend working here for over a year, because it becomes very draining physically and mentally."
bad,"Good:"
bad,"I spent nearly 5 years at CVS. I wasn't promoted until after I had my baby, 2.5 years into working there, coming in for every shift asked to be covered, staying longer after my shift was supposed to be over to wait for the arrival of the next employee. No incentives to do so. Had to jump through hoops for accommodations while I had a high risk pregnancy. The best part of the job was a few coworkers and the regular customers.  I will never work for the company again and dissuade people from working there."
bad,"a good job to start off with if your in your early 20's or out of high school. Task were pretty simple, management was okay. just too much repetition."
bad,"A typical day at CVS is busy and hectic. When fully staffed, the teamwork and moral are excellent but with the cutting of hours and more work placed on the pharmacists and techs, things tend to get very frantic very fast."
bad,"In the front store, you come in to a new shift and without fail, the opening supervisor drops a load of work onto your lap because they were understaffed in the morning and forced to sit at a cash register instead of doing what they are actually paid for. The store manager is your best ally because they have even more stress than you as their job always hangs in the balance. Your job as a shift supervisor entails making sure the shelves are stocked and the money is counted. It's difficult to hold your employees accountable for their actions whether positive or negative because there is not enough time in a day nor the staff to actually hold discussions. The company has been downsizing for years in the front store area and do not care about you one bit."
bad,"For as large as a company that CVS, in the Fortune top 10, I wasn't inpressed with a call center that had broken chairs to sit in while taking calls. Overall the training and help provided was not enough"
bad,"Business more worried about the company than their employees, or their families. Discrimination among employees on hours, schedules and what is expected."
bad,a huge company that focuses on customer service but with not enough coverage or payroll to accommodate the needs. Great company to meet people but company lacks on helping their fellow employees  to succeed. Most of managers are set up to fail.
bad,staffing and wait time are not properly/ ideally set leaving customers unhappy. It also also not optimal to multi-task to the extent that is demanded by this position. the most difficult part of the job is staffing/ workflow and multitasking that removes focus from processing prescriptions. There is a high demand to multitask which creates safety concerns
bad,"CVS Pharmacy is a crazy stressed place most of the time. Customers line up, prescriptions come in faster than they can be entered and prepared, and people get upset. The Pharmacy is usually understaffed. Managers try to be balanced, but because of the pressure they are under to finish everything, they expect you to keep up with the pace. I didn’t mind working quickly, but going constantly with an impossible work load for long days does make you tired, and feels like no matter what you’ll never get on top of everything. There isn’t enough help everyday... so every day the stress of meeting patient needs starts again. Things like going to the restroom can set you behind in your work. Always asked to work overtime. For a ten hour shift, you get 30 minutes to sit total... which is all on your lunch break."
bad,"Hours were decent, but inconsistent. Manager was not a people person, and had bad communication skills. Manager was prone to outbursts in-front of customers, and would demean his employees as he saw fit."
bad,"The location I worked at was very slow paced, there wasn't much to do other than restock and wait for customers which is why I didn't enjoy working there as much. I would recommend working there if  you enjoy working alone. I rarely got to work with a co-worker, it was mainly the store manager and I during a shift."
bad,"CVS is a mixed bag. The people are great, office is nice, they have a beautiful cafeteria with delicious food, they pay well and the campus is pretty, and all of this is compensation for the daily abuse and toxic working environment you will need to endure."
bad,"Workplace culture is good for CVS full time but for contractors, it's not good. It also depends on which team you are working. Some teams do not have good work-life balance because of too many projects which are quite complex."
bad,I love being a pharmacy technician I just don't make enough money working for CVS they continually cut hours and not enough staff to provide excellent customer service and when they do hire new people they are inadequately trained.
bad,if u dont have nothing nice to say dont say it at all. but a job is a job . the people there are some what nice . the managment it okay just depends on how they really feel.
bad,METRICS oriented. Inadequate time to adhere to compliance issues. Patient interaction and heping patients is enjoyable High technician turnover is a barrier to delivering results. Managed 13 staff members.Fostered a high performing work environment through teamwork. Built on strengths and developed underperforming staff. Time management and attention to detail was my strength.High paced work environment. One of the busiest retail pharmacist in  the region.
bad,"I left because hours were cut during slow seasons, so I couldn't make a living.  There was one quite unethical worker who was not apparently addressed."
bad,"The pay is very low for the type of job you have to do, especially with some rude customers in the pharmacy department. We barely get any incentives in CVS"
bad,"Had a rough time as the youngest and newest of my coworkers, management was good most of the time. Received a high level of training so I felt and was very prepared, but often wasn't treated as such."
bad,"Field managers only care about numbers and whether or not you are meeting their metrics. As a pharmacist, they like to short staff you so you are often working more than your shifts to finish up. Worst part is that your budget for ancillary staff/help always fluctuates result in high employee turnover and lack of help when needed. It would be a great company as long as they get rid of their scheduling constraints (MySchedule). I get NO breaks not even for lunch (we cant close) even though the employee handbook allows you one. Those that do take breaks dont last very long with CVS.  They do very little to make sure that pharmacists have their breaks/lunches."
bad,"If you're lucky you can get a store manager that will work with you to move in the company, but its very easy to hit a ceiling. Some managers don't care and just go through the motions, and you'll have a hard time advancing under them"
bad,Ive been working for CVS pharmacy for a little over two years after taking over target pharmacy which I worked for about 6 years with. I fell in love with the pharmacy world at target pharmacy but ever since cvs took over that love has been ruined
bad,"They need to fix the computer system, bottom line, stop rolling out new things till the old things work. I love the profession and the patients, and the management. It's just to many new things, all the time."
bad,Typical Retail industry. Depends on the store manager and peers if it is a decent work environment. Company is top down with no regard to performance or quality from staff. basically show up and that's it.
bad,"-Limited help at busier stores"
bad,"The company was Omnicare when I first got hired, once CVS bought it and took it over, working there became a nightmare. They took on so much more homes and facilities that it became too much for the staff. The management was okay, but they were dealing with the blows just like the staff was. Long story short, CVS made Omnicare rough. The pay was okay but not worth the amount of stress that was put on you. The PTO was fine but sometimes you ran into issues trying to use it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend but if you need something overnight or are looking for something PRN/Per diem, Id say go for it. But Full time, no."
bad,"Being a pharmacist at CVS is great to be a part of the community. Trying to acheve all that CVS wants you to do while not really getting any break, or quality help, makes the job tough. Management just shoot for metrics. No support from the company."
bad,"Verify medical coverage through phone or online, given 60 minutes to finish each patient. Wear a headset and logged into the phone, ready to accept incoming calls. Verification consists of many details and researching before complete my task. Our work is normally monitored by a supervisor. The workplace is busy and quiet since most people are on the phone. Some of the most difficult things about my work includes keeping up with the rapid changes on a weekly/monthly basis in the way we process things, communication with the insurance reps and not getting correct information, miscommunication, and getting a supervisor to help me with an issue. The workload is quite heavy and I'm now experiencing hand and feet pain However I enjoy our birthdays and other celebrations we do throughout the year such as bridal parties and holidays potlucks."
bad,"Management is great, but the hours and compensation were very poor. The hardest part of the job was the flow of the department. Everybody was everywhere. Some techs felt as though they were superior to others just because they were males."
bad,i did not enjoy working at CVS because of the dirty work environment and poor structure . I also did not appreciate the rude staff and the horrible customers
bad,"The training was really good, I learned a lot working from them. At times the job can be unnecessarily stressful. It isn't a bad place to work, it's just not my cup of tea"
bad,"very stressful, to much corporate rules and expectations, high turn over rate, no time for training, expect continual growth as they cut your hours and tools."
bad,"Promises of benifits and raises but they limit your hours so you can't get the benifits and have to travel across the country to do the classes for the raise.  "
bad,"Pretty good job, but lacks the ability to have a set schedule. Changes weekly, very hectic. There isn't enough training for what we do. Managers seem to be upset when you ask how to do something you've never done."
bad,Job advancement not based upon experience. Supervisors were not trustworthy and lacked experienced required to do job duties and maintain their teams.
bad,"It's a fast paced environment. Techs are not paid enough, thus difficult to find and keep good techs. You're doing the job of multiple people. No breaks. Some good benefits (insurance, 401 k). Numerous metrics to keep up with. A lot of customers annoyed and/or confused by the multiple phone calls and texts they receive."
bad,"Very stressful, not enough pay for the work done.  Not a lot of opportunities to move up in the company.  fast paced between the pharmacy and the store."
bad,NIce people to work with and the customers are great. Work hours are more than I originally signed on for but they cant keep help. Pay sucks for the work load and store expectations. Its stressful there more times than not. I love the business however and a work day usually goes quickly. No third shift hours and most holidays the pharmacy is closed.
bad,"A typical day, is reviewing overall scores in customer service, and making it a goal towards improving our weak points throughout the day. Generating prescriptions and filling them promptly. Entering and billing insurances, calling on insurance claims,workers compensation billing, no-fault billing.Prior to working for CVS, i had no experience in insurance as a whole, or medications. I have learned so much in those two areas, knowing how insurance works and learning brands from generics and what medication is for a specific treatment. Our workplace is very diverse, we take pride in working with a good attitude while dealing with a lot of different personalities, in  which can provide some tough situations when a customer is dissatisfied with some of corporates features in customer service. The most enjoyable part about my job is the people that i work with, we all work as a team and we help each other throughout the day."
bad,I worked for CVS for over 20 years.  I loved my job and worked very hard for them.  They have many lay offs and they do not seem to care about the loyalty and tenure of their employees.
bad,"Representatives fight, threaten one another and still have a job. With management aware. Compensation is great and some people are too. It's just extremely unprofessional."
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful, we have have to work very hard to get very little pay, hours arent stable they cut your hours so that the big bosses could get more pay. The management though is very nice they work with you,and make you laugh eveni though its a very stressful job. The hardest part of this job there is alot to learn, and alot to cope with it. My favorite part about this job is i get to be around great people, and i get to help people feel better even if its alittle part it makes me feel good."
bad,"A typical day at CVS Pharmacy is extremely stressful especially for what it pays. The job overall has taught me patience and how to work with people of all different backgrounds. Hardest part of the job is corporates unrealistic expectations for its employees. Its a very demanding job, standing for hours. Overall the job was a learning experience, looks good on resume but don't think I would recommend it to anyone."
bad,"A typical day at work is highly stressful. Management is poor company-wide, there is little support/appreciation from corporate, and technician help is extremely limited due to financial costs. The pressure is constantly high as you must be able to efficiently and safely multitask, provide patient care, and meet numbers assigned from a corporate level. What I love most about my job is being able to work directly with my patients and being part of a fast-paced environment. The positive feedback I receive from my customers, and witnessing myself make a positive impact on their health and lives, is what keeps me satisfied at my job."
bad,"It's just like any other large, public, corporation.  They care about the bottom line and that's it.  You are just a number, a drop in the bucket.  It's nice to have a top 7 company on your resume, but you will be worked hard, and unless you're in executive leadership, you are not a decision maker."
bad,The amount of work they expect one human being to accomplish is impossible. You will age faster and die sooner if you decide to retire with this company. Do it if you have to in order to pay off loans but look for somewhere else for the long term
bad,"We had a lot of work to do aside from filling prescriptions, but we didnt have enough staff. They would always cut hours monthly and made the workflow stressful."
bad,I was initially excited to work for this company but realized within first week of training that I would not be there long term. Training is minimal 3wks it consists of navigating the system. We were told would have someone to assist us once done with training and on the floor. This ended up being maybe acouple hours a day for a week or so. No training covered what your job consists of when your on the floor but you are expected to meet production. Management is aware of the lack of training which results in the high turn over. They actually joke about not being able to retain employees. I honestly don't see how this place is still in business with all the money they don't collect on.
bad,This job is not for everyone.  To work at CVS you have to have a lot of tolerance.  Corporate asks a lot of it's techs and you may find your self doing all the work one day.  Dont expect to get a good raise. I worked there for 4 years and barely went up 1 dollar.  Although its retail half of the work is calling people.  You will constantly be on the phone as well as having to do the registers and medication prep.  If you like fast paced jobs where time flies then you probably will like this job.  If you are a sensitive person then dont work at CVS.
bad,"This company has improved, but some of the long term employees are a little pushy and entitled. Otherwise, it's an okay company."
bad,"Poor management, not a safe work environment, no room for advancement, no room  for increased pay, and they have short breaks and very poor training."
bad,Job is very good when it comes to compensation and benefits. Very understaffed and very unproffessional. Management is careless and inconsiderate
bad,fun work place with supportive management. it is all about the numbers. Dont pay as expected but it is expected of a big company
bad,CVS has great personnel working in the trenches. Everyone cares about each other and respectful almost like a family.  There seems to be shortage of resources and the days are much longer.
bad,"as a salaried employee, i felt that i was expected to come in early and stay late.  never enough staffing.  they only care about their bottom line."
bad,"Take calls from employees for password resets and other issue if you did not know how to resolve the customers issue co-workers were available to assist you, the management team for the helpdesk was not very technical most times they did not have an answer to your question on that side but would we good at addressing your work needs."
bad,"Great co-workers, but all departments are under-staffed and over-worked. Excess amount of overtime, late days, and depending on your department; six day work weeks are common."
bad,"I gained much experience at this job through leadership, however the compensation for my work was low. I also had reached the point of advancement that was available."
bad,"The pay is horrible for all of the work that has to be put in its not worthed, there is absolutely no security and the company doesn't worry about nothing but the money in there pockets and give you the least that they can."
bad,"very, very unprofessional work place. also it is very unorganized. they closed an account and left alot of people without jobs and didnt say anything thus far and it suppose to be up friday"
bad,"They require a lot for a little. Stressful customer service environment with high employee turnover and few perks.  However, once hired, management is pretty good about accommodating your schedule.  The biggest obstacle is getting in the door and passing the personality assessment on the application."
bad,"I have never been so relieved to loose a job at the warehouse, and I am the type to tough it out thinking everything will be fine as long as I do what I am suppose to do. Not at this job. There is very little job security. You have to be in certain departments to be capable of making it. Select few in the other departments have to have a ""fighter"" personality to them. This is at the Chemung/Waverly, NY warehouse mind you."
bad,"A typical day would be making many calls on multiple specialties and multiple types of facilities. There was a lack of focus on who we needed to focus on. The great part of the job was that I am passionate about making sales calls, interacting with physicians, the total office call, and focusing on making a difference in patients lives. The TM role is by far the toughest job in the company as I have been told. This is a great place to work for the right person."
bad,"Typical day at Coram is placing orders all day and helping patient/customer with there medical needs. Co-workers are friendly, and easy to get alone with. The hardest day of my job is telling a patient/customer that we having problems with getting there medical needs meet at this time and the most enjoyable is to help a patient/customer with there medical needs and helping them correct a problem that they are having."
bad,Busy and sometimes stressful job. Not what I originally expected.
bad,All they care about are numbers and meeting goals and not enough about the staff.
bad,"Workload for the past 5 years was manageable until management began to cut hours drastically. Skeleton schedule is exactly what its spelled out to be, the ""bare bones"" minimum amount of help to get the job done.  Would be Ok if it weren't for the fact that if someone calls out one day during the week it becomes virtually impossible to catch up.  Now that many new pharmacist grads are being pumped out of the pharmacy schools in the area upper management has become quite bold in their expectations from individuals.  Its not uncommon to work 2 or 3 hours past your shift or even come in during your day off."
bad,"Call  center  inbound /member  call for   coverage and price  with   copay , order  prescription ,hour good   , co work helpful,  good training program"
bad,The Structure of this company as a whole leaves allot to be desired.
bad,"A typical day at work would be ringing up customers with lots of coupons, making sure the store is faced, clean and neat. I learned how to check in vendors, stock shelves. Management and coworkers were okay to work with at times depending on if they liked you or you did what they wanted you to do. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unhappy pharmacy customers because there where not enough staffed help and they had to wait. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers that came in and knew you by name."
bad,It started out as on ok place and then alot of fatorism came into play and no one does anything about it
bad,I really didn't get to learn very much they was rushing me in to everything with out really showing me..don't really like retail but if I had to work in it again I would
bad,We work for the most part as a team. My co-workers are very friendly.
bad,"Not a bad place to work, but push the limits of safety. The co workers I worked with were great."
bad,"Started the day out in mgmt. meeting. People there were great, the pay was also good. The mgrs. were great. But it is a production job so you got paid by how much work you did...stressful...but overall, the job was great..."
bad,Enjoy help customer finding what they need
bad,Variety of opportunities exist to interact with a variety of personalities.
bad,"life/work balance is lacking. Little time to interact with patients, or eat. Much time spent outside of work completing manditory tasks that are not able to be done at work. pharmacy is staffed poorly with far too few technician hours to complete workload. Very little support from pharmacy supervisor."
bad,"First time ever working an environment like this and I'd have to say, ""The friends I made are great; if only the management would loosen up a bit""."
bad,my experience with the job wast bad the only thing i didn't like about it was they gave me so many little hours. organilly i was promised more hours but i received less
bad,"It's run by pharmacists, so it is better than average. I did not have any say on my schedule so I got to work every weekend. I did not stay long. df"
bad,I was not impressed by this company. They tell you and lead you to believe one thing and they do something differently.
bad,the company was a great company but the call center managers and structure wasnt
bad,The company focus is work driven. They have pot lucks. Rarely any other fun activities.
bad,"simple tasks, easy work for high school kids or college students to make money. you'll meet a lot of good people around your community and if you're providing great service they just might offer you a better job."
bad,"This company isn't bad to work for but the customers made it agonizing. CVS had a lot of red tape, especially with their coupon policies so expect to get yelled at or an attitude at least once per shift."
bad,"I learned that couponing was a big deal. Could have better management, especially for those who have kids. My experience was very cold when it came to me being a parent. I received very unprofessional comments by management. Hardest part of the job was being respected."
bad,will not recommend to work here. Constantly have to partake in modules that are extremely time consuming. wages are minimum. not worth the work performed.
bad,"Impractical performance expectations and usually understaffed. Most employees are treated as replaceable. Lack of accountability trust, respect, communication, and workflow. Not an environment suited for career growth. Great introduction to customer service."
bad,"1/ typical work day as pharmacist"
bad,consistently asks to work over-time no matter how many times you tell them now. this is followed by consistent harassment if one denies to work over time.
bad,"At the time of the review I am an employee but I feel the company is disconnected from the store level. I feel the hire ups could do more to help the stores. I've worked with the company for 4 months and I seen many issues that can be resolved with simple upgrades and improvements to everyday life from newer computers to security."
bad,"Poor management, never get the job done on time always gotta stay back pass my time and I finish all my work. I work thru my lunch break and they still want me to stay pass my hours to work some more... CVS is very unfair..."
bad,"CVS did not treat their employees right. We were always understaffed which set a bad work environment to work in, since there was no time to actually get task done."
bad,"Expect to work hard and not get recognized. They are constantly making changes and they expect you to adapt quickly. No real concern for the customer, it is all business."
bad,Constantly pressured fast paced consequence based environment Union unresponsive and unhelpful... work environment design for employee lost Nott company... walk time on brakes to break rooms and restrooms unreasonable no cell phones and hard work is not rewarded it's required.... great benefits if you're full time part-time okay benefits as well seniority required required
bad,"A typical day would involve working alone and juggling multiple different tasks with very little help. Management were very critical, but did not offer the proper steps to try and rectify any issues."
bad,solid company with the ability to work more hours but very hard to keep sane as they will cut your hours every chance they get.  Overall i would rate them 2 out of 5 stars
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, under appreciated. Hard to enjoy going to work when you know you will have to do all the work because your coworkers are lazy and management doesn’t correct the problems."
bad,the manager was a psychopath . all she did was drink chocolate milk and talk with a lisp. she was super weird and watched over your shoulder. she didn't actually work at all. she was the laziest person.
bad,"Management was fantastic. One of the best I've had. That being, said, I can not offer any other positive statements. Minimal pay, there isn't enough staff to accomplish the workload so you're always behind. Computer system is ancient and if there's even a tiny issue, the cashier can not resolve it without manager approval (manager's card to scan). Coupon-ers make the experience even worse given the outdated computer system. Larceny is rampant because of low payroll; not enough staff to protect goods at the store. I never felt good working at CVS because of all the issues."
bad,The work environment can be complicated and it is less of a family feel. You keep to yourself and you don’t talk much to your fellow employees unless asking questions. The help depends on the person you ask.
bad,"If you are in school or have a child, this is a perfect job. I was there part time and was able to balance effectively.  Depends on location. Good if you need something fast. Slow paced"
bad,Pay is okay. No work life balance. Long hours with no breaks. Lots of pressure from corporate. Benefits are great and so is the 401k. How the work environment is depends on where you work.
bad,the location I worked at was a 24 hour store so it was a rather busy store i enjoyed the work here the job was not hard at all the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers
bad,"Overall moral is negative in multiple locations. I know other retailers run with tight labor but CVS ran labor so tight that employees and or managers are frequently running the front store by themselves. In the front store it was difficult to find time to do a little extra for the customers and employees...I probably heard 100+ times that ""we don't have time for that."" It feels like the front store was an after thought. For example, most stores landscaping was terrible at the local stores and upper management  never addressed the issue for a long time. I am big on first impressions and the market and regional leadership said to wait for the city to fine us  so they can prove to upper management that landscaping is a problem. I don't know how this was the solution but we went weeks with landscaping. I don't understand waiting for a fine from the local municipalities and local community they work in."
bad,MAJORRRR lack of security. Theres literally 2 people in the whole store ( cashier and supervisor) there was heavy shop lifters and they expect us to protect the store? HA! they need a security there.
bad,"CVS is for someone looking for his first job."
bad,"CVS Health Care has unfortunately taken a turn for the worse- they expect a lot of the employees without giving them any resources to work with.  Hours are constantly cut, yet goals and requirements always go up..."
bad,Staff was very friendly and accommodating but the store I worked in was high theft risk and very stressful to work at. Sometimes job responsibilities contradicted each other. This was my second job and I decided to leave the company for several reasons some including the location of the store and getting promoted at my first place of employment.
bad,The manager is sexist and does not take anyone under consideration. When you tell him in the interview the hours and days you would like he does it for the first week and then he puts you on whatever he needs and forgets your availability and doesn't care.
bad,"CVS will probably pay you more than the average, but they certainly will ask you to work more than the average company. Be prepared to volunteer your time if you expect to be a high performing pharmacy."
bad,"Overall, I would not recommend anyone work there. It was poorly trained and it was corrupt to say the least. I enjoyed some of my coworkers and the usual customers but that is all. Also the hours are not steady so don't expect a steady check. That is all"
bad,"Working for CVS was hectic, and a thankless job.  I was cursed at by the pharmacists, yelled at, told to ""get out of my way"", and generally treated like poorly.  Management was poor.  Scheduling was poor.  Training was non-existent.  They wanted only the fastest trained people doing ""production"", which was filling prescription, so if you were new, you never got to do this unless it was after 8pm at night, and super super slow.  Same thing with prescription entry on the computer.  It was delegated to a few people, and that was it, unless it was nighttime.  There are computer training modules to get done, but you are not allowed to check your profile on the computer system to see what needs to be done when, so it's thrown at you last minute, and they want you to put in 20-30hrs worth of work in just 2-3 days.  It's insane!  I think it's a horrible place to work."
bad,"Good company, but  the site I worked at wasn't the best management. My manager wasn't the greatest and when asking for time off, I kept receiving calls to work. Also was difficult to call out while sick, so if you get sick you better work."
bad,A poorly organized place where the managers and higher ups care little of the workers and their opinions. Long hours are mainly due to poor working conditions of machinery that run the building.
bad,coworkers were really great people. the management was terrible. cvs really don't not care about their employees. the pay is not that great you barely get hours
bad,"cvs has alot of workload to complete everyday, with the expectation to get everything done, but are unwilling to staff the store to complete said workload, always behind and pressure from above. with no realistic answers to fix issues"
bad,"it was clear who the favorites were and who was dislike. "
bad,"A lot of incentives from growth and advancement, flexible hours and resources. Eventually management started degrading, hours started being cut down to incomprehensible amounts and employees started being overburdened by more responsibilities that they could possibly managed with almost 0 acknowledgement."
bad,no opportunities for advancement. lots of corporate red tape. high stress job. not rewarding. 30 min breaks. always open including holidays. overtime and holiday pay.
bad,"3 years employed as a pharmacy technician, over worked and way under paid. "
bad,When i started out at CVS i was hired as a full time employee. I gave birth to a child and when i came back to work i am no longer getting full time hours to support myself
bad,This company is short staffed and promises raises or positions they cannot follow through with. Went down to part-time for school and was still being scheduled for full-time after asking for the change many times
bad,Working at the pharmacy I was located was always behind on filling prescriptions which stressed everyone out which made it a tense work environment. The pharmacists were more annoyed by the tech's asking questions rather than be helpful. Majority of my co-workers didn't like the job and told me I would hate it by a couple months in and I did. So much negativity and stress in one small work environment.
bad,"Nothing to say, temp job."
bad,CVS was a very disorganized company to work for. i was always waiting on the last day of the work week for the new schedule to come out to see what i was working the next day.
bad,"Don't work here. Can't stand this place, the count the minutes you take to use the restroom and what time you can go. They count every second of what you are doing."
bad,CVS bought our pharmacy and ruined it. They bought omnicare and turned it from a Great place to work to misery and now they are about to sell again now that everything is terrible.
bad,"While I'm grateful for the knowledge I gained working here, the company itself is very bad at any sort of employee outreach or rewarding employees for a job well done. Free lunches are nonexistent, you get the minimum holidays off. They don't even have Employee of the Month anymore. And when they did, all you got was enough ""points"" for the equivalent of a $5 company gift card. Insulting! Especially considering how hard we all work - it's impossible to meet your goals because the goalpost changes every week. The healthcare options are also very poor for a healthcare company."
bad,I worked at CVS while I was in college. I would def recommend if you are a college student needing extra money. As for a career I highly wouldn't recommend it.
bad,"Sometimes theres no help. Customers are rude. The workload is very heavy. You have to make phone calls and fill prescriptions at the same time, Its anoy..."
bad,"Definitely depends what store you're located at. My store is located in a highly entitled neighborhood where they think everything you do is wrong. Very fast paced and high volume. My hourly wage is no where near where you think it would be considering everything we do. My coworkers are great and my manager is awesome, but definitely not worth it. Health insurance according to my coworkers is bad. Im there part-time so I dont get health insurance. I'd recommend working at a hospital if you're looking into being a pharm tech, you'll get paid much more."
bad,"Depending on your store;"
bad,"Pharmacy was very busy filling 400-500 rxs per day and was "
bad,"My experience was stressful due to lack of staff and the number of errors that I witnessed being made, some very serious. Some employees cut corners and didn't follow protocol mainly due to lack of staff, but sometimes from talking too much or getting interrupted and not recounting the order they were working on.  Nothing was done when I reported these errors."
bad,"work was stressful - especiallyduring ""welcome season"" required to overtime, hoidays."
bad,"CVS micromanages...Pharmacy alone is significantly stressful,  throw in numerous metric requirements and you are ready to year your heir out, plus you could easily cheat on metrics and if you did,  it gave you an unfair advantage.   Significant issue with seniorism."
bad,"Boss is a good person to work for, expects a lot but great teacher and mentor. I believe you will enjoy the experience and see things you may have never seen before"
bad,"Responsible for customer satisfaction, technician supervision, problem resolution, inventory control and regulatory compliance.  Multitasking skill is highly recommended."
bad,Painfully there has been a rather perceptible decline in personnel management in The CVS/Pharmacy that is worth a critical analysis of the handlers of recruitment in the place at this time.
bad,"Leadership is a little off"
bad,I work at a 24hr pharmacy and we are always understaffed. Over time is not allowed. The pay isn't worth to the work. Very stressful job. The people we manage to hire are incompetent.
bad,"I consider myself to be a focused and great at multi-tasking. My day-to-day would be to go to assigned station, answer calls, data entry, and accept new scripts or cash outgoing scripts. Management does step in when patients are anxious or become irate. In retail, numbers are a big part of our day to day which can make it stressful when it is constantly made a priority."
bad,"It was the busiest of the CVS's in that town, and the manager was awesome but a couple of the other pharmacists were hard to work with.  It was pretty hard to get through the day many days."
bad,"typical day is given more tasks than able to finish in one day and then told you are a horrible employee because you didn't finish above said tasks."
bad,"While the technicians would slave away, the manager who was paid 7 times more would sit in the back with his feet up. Employees are unappreciated, underpaid, and over worked."
bad,Training took couple of months and they sent me all over the city. It was inconvenient especially for a full time student. The job demands too much of someone who's priority is school.
bad,"Training is very long, was very hard to make time for as a full-time college student. The job also demands too much for someone who was in school and focused on their education."
bad,"I'd rather not go into too much detail.  What I learned was that the attitudes of the upper management trickle down through the layers of the chain of command, and that if the ""uppers"" have a dictatorial streak, their promoting practices will favor others who have similar approaches to their work.  They, similarly, will tend towards penalizing anyone who does not devote energy to a cut-throat way of thinking and acting.   This went beyond the 150-character minimum.   As stated above, I'd rather have not gone into much detail."
bad,"Manager will cut your hours saying that they do not have enough money and hours, pharmacist yelled at me in front of customers because he got frustrated that we were too busy and it was just two of us working"
bad,The best part of working at CVS as a pharmacy technician is the fact that I am able to help people. Our job is to make sure customers take care of their health which I enjoyed.
bad,While there are some great people who work here some of the corporate managers will give you the axe for missing one thing especially if you are doing Loss Prevention. They pay was good but your job is always in jeopardy!!!
bad,"I have  worked with CVS pharmacy for almost 30 years. Ive seen lots of changes with in the company.  1st let me say I love what I do. I really enjoy getting to know my patients and them getting to know me.  "
bad,Typical retail chain regarding typical day at work. Staffing is at a bare minimum. I wish the med-level management was honest. I do not appreciate being lied to (multiple times.)
bad,Management is more concerned about company growth and appearance than employees. No positive feedback from management. You were expected to perform jobs away from the checkout area but still be available to greet customers and be readily available to customer.
bad,"Working in a retail pharmacy has shown me just how hectic they can be. This job definitely teaches you patience, whether that be from doctors offices or the patients themselves. You learn to go above and beyond to make your patients happy and make sure that their experience is the best. Although it can be difficult, seeing your patients happy is rewarding."
bad,Cutting everybody. A lot of responsibility for virtually no pay. The pharmacist was nice but the ammount of work expected for so litle pay was disheartening.
bad,"It's one of the easiest jobs you could ever do.  Good pay, great benefits.  The kicker is if you have to ever get a reasonable accommodation or FMLA for medical problems for yourself or a family member the HR will look for any means necessary to terminate you.  And if you think reaching out to the ethics committee will help, wrong.  I done that. I think that's what got me fired actually.  Retaliation. But this was just the Knoxville center.  Other centers may be amazing.  But I am not the only person this happened to at that site.  I am one of five people that I know of that the same exact situation happened to. Oh, and you have to have a doctor's note to have extended potty breaks or extra potty breaks if you ever in the course of your career may need to go potty between your breaks or lunch.  Because you're stuck on your phone until your break or lunch.  You cannot get off your phone for anything other than breaks, lunches or fire drills."
bad,The job is emotionally draining with little to no advancement available through the company without years upon years of service. Calls are unfairly screened for shift choices and quality is not monitored consistently.
bad,"I work for a division they have only owned for a few years. It is still very much a start up company. In a need to fill seats they are hiring people with no experience, including management. It has not been a good experience. Managers and Supervisors do not make a cohesive work environment. They bad mouth each other to hourly employees, very unprofessional."
bad,"CVS is a rich company because the management system contents good business money making ideas;therefore, this company has provided poor working condition and minimal benefits to its' employee."
bad,doesnt care about their employees. revolving door work place. as long as you dont have a life outside of work that is how you move up within the company.
bad,"It is a retail job, so everything that that entails is included. Driving metrics and sales goals are incentives to get hours, which means you get to work. And no matter how nice your coworkers are, you have to remember, the company DOES NOT care about you."
bad,Not a good place to work. really upsetting that they cut hours so drastically and make us work in poor conditions without any extra assistance. thanks
bad,"usually work morning shifts , stock and load shelves with merchandise , unload stock truck provide community service for shoppers , nice 30 minute break"
bad,Working in  a pharmacy is A great passion of mine  because once again  I'm helping someone to cure or  manage what ever issues they have. It was a learning experience
bad,Company was low compensation and understaffed. It was hard to help raise a kid and the raises were below par for an individual that went above and beyond normal expectations.
bad,This company really try ad keep up the moral in the office. I work overnight and love the people I work with. We are currently under new owner with CVS and I see a lot of what I like about the job is changing. Hopefully they have something better planned. :(
bad,Learning about medications and getting a bit feel of the medical field this job will be a good starter for you if you are considering going into the medical field
bad,"o	Maintained medication inventory"
bad,a typical day for me would be 7 and a half hours in the shipping dept. and 2 and a half hours packing.management was totally hands off ...there was an i don't care attitude and they weren't very helpful.the culture was bad creating a very hard place to work....half of the people worked hard and the other half didn't care. it is a very monotonous job but that didn't really bother me and the shipping part was very physical which i enjoy.
bad,"Impossible work enviorment, only two people to run the front of store and employess always call out.  The hours are long and late, most store open at 7am and close at midnight"
bad,You have to work extremely hard to get a decent wage. Your days off can be few of and far apart. A lot of the staff do work very hard and are very good at their jobs. Then there's often the opposite. They let it all down.
bad,"The pay was wonderful, decent benefits. The management was absolutely awful and so was their attendance policy. The company as a whole has the right idea but they don't understand that people are people."
bad,"CVS Pharmacy is a nice place for customers but employees work very hard for the little pay. Employees does not have a voice. The training that CVS provides is outstanding, you will always remain knowledgeable about your field and position."
bad,"I'll make this quick. If you like a stressful job with low pay, apply to CVS pharmacy. Despite the amount of pressure you're given each day to complete your tasks, the pay is hardly any compensation. Do not knock off the years of your life by applying."
bad,Not a company read to hire. This is a start up company and are not organize. Everyone is out for themselves. Not a team player environment. Management is very rude.
bad,"Good customer service"
bad,I worked at CVS distribution for roughly about 5 mos. It was mandatory OT which was pretty much every week. We worked sometimes 50+ hours. The only good part was some of my coworkers
bad,"I would not recommend a pharmacy technician job to anyone. At least not in a retail setting. The workload and stress is too high, and supervisors and company do not treat you well."
bad,"Very hard emotionally, you are dealing with the big medicine game that's going on in America. You will realize how hard it is when you have to deny someone based on insurance."
bad,"Strong training, technical and customer service. But once on the floor, customer service was not as important as calls per hour. I would/will not skimp on customer service."
bad,"Great 401K, Investment opportunities. Health insurance offered is a high deductible plan.  Unrealistic expectations, no pharmacist overlap and long hours can effect patient safety in busy stores."
bad,I was an employee in the job while I was in high school. was not a very good environment. There was a lot of drama between staff and management. This place was not very professional.
bad,"Would be nice if it wasnt for all the micro management involve"
bad,CVS Pharmacy was a job that I could say wasn't a job that I would go back to I was really poor management.
bad,"My most rewarding part of work there was extending excellent customer service, to my customers and helping them and each and every patient to the fullest."
bad,i didn't find this company really good to work for. company doesn't back the employee when they know customer is at fault.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of filling up to an average of 90-100 prescriptions per day during the weekdays. At least one-third of a typical work shift is dedicated to solving prescription issues with insurance. At CVS, I have learned that team work, efficiency, taking the initiative to complete a task, speed in service, and connecting with customers are important key roles in helping the pharmacy succeed in making the customers highly satisfied. Management in this work place is fair to the employees, including me. My coworkers are fun individuals who encourage me to enjoy my job. The only thing I find difficult about this job is knowing and having to accept that maintenance drugs such as insulin can be very expensive. I wish maintenance drugs were more affordable. The most enjoyable part of this job is that we all get along with each other and I enjoy connecting with customers."
bad,Company favors their stock holders more than their employees therefor you work very little hours at minimum wage. Its a great job for students looking to go into the pharmacy field
bad,This was a good job but not something that would benefical to my future job prospect. The job setting was unfair as workers did not have much benefits and worked pharmacist duties with little pay. Still I learned a lot from the job
bad,"This company has given me, experience and skills. A pleasure to work for this company. Wonderful benefits, insurance is great. Work environment is fast, employees are very helpful."
bad,"the job was stressful due to lack of motivation with employees. management did not hire according to motivation, just hired to have people fill spaces"
bad,This is a good job to have. Offers good hours and pay raises the longer you stay. Management is not the greatest but staff members do work together.
bad,worked as a pharmacy tech. Wasnt for me. Very repetitive work. Worked independently mostly. Everyone kept to themselves.
bad,Very busy during summer hours and weekends. Assisting customers with their pharmacy needs and answering phone calls as they come in.
bad,This company could use a total lower level management makeover.  They need additional training and personnel management and how to retain top talent.  Need to trust the pharmacists more to make better judgements with regard to scheduling of support staff.
bad,"This Company was ever adding more goals to meet; and bascially ""chained to your desk"".  Not a good environment  to work in.  Always worrying about loosing your job and at my age that was stressful."
bad,"good learning environment, on your feet all shift except for your break, low pay and super busy around 5pm. there is no PTO and moderate amount of flexibility when you want off work."
bad,"Employees are unhappy with the unfair demands they ask of long time employees. They ask for you to do many task compared to one for new hires, but yet held to same stats. The company is more concerned with profit and speed. We use to care about patient and quality."
bad,"I really don't think the company is bad, I just wish they offered more benefits and paid their employees more. Also the cvs extra card discount isn't enough and when you want another card if yours was lost its such a hassle to get another one as an employee!"
bad,"The Company is not very well organized.  Training was very challenging due to lack of experienced or absent of trainers."
bad,"Again, Just do not feel very appreciated here. I work hard and do my job well, better than most, and there is no reward for it other than the occasional certificate that says ""Good job"" basically."
bad,"Busy...busy...Fast-paced environment."
bad,"When I first started I loved my job, got along well with everyone, and enjoyed helping the customers. Then hours were cut and I've been struggling since. The management isn't that great."
bad,a typical day at work  it busy from 8am to 9pm closing... co worker all get along .. we help one another with completing our tasks. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the mean customers.. the best part of the job is when I complete all my tasks because it makes me feel good ..
bad,"CVS is a very stressful type of work place is it is open 24 hours."
bad,"come in, answer phones, fill prescriptions, and ring the people out at the register.  It was stressful at times, but what job isn't."
bad,"worked in triage for a year on third shift and excelled at the actual but was treated unfairly by my reporting manager because i very rarely saw or spoke with her as she mostly left before i arrived. they show extreme favoritism when it comes to scheduling, pto or tardiness points. third shift is expected to work all holidays. no foramal training or orientation was given. some employees will come and go and the manager adjusts their time while others are held unfairly accountable. no room for growth within the company. they do not care about the clients they serve...just the bottom line. DO NOT WORK HERE unless you are very desperate for work."
bad,Overall it was a decent temporary assignment I was placed through a temp agency. I worked in the call center answering inbound calls from customers.
bad,"I never felt like a valued employee at CVS Pharmacy. There unspoken motto seemed to be ""do more with less"". Every day was stressful and nerve-racking."
bad,"Collected patient information submitting medical costs to insurance carriers and Medicare/Medicaid."
bad,"Metrics are used and it is all about getting the highest numbers.  One must fill as many scripts as possible in a timely manner to keep the numbers up.  There is very limited time to converse with or help customers because there is a voicemail that must be checked before 14 minutes hit or in about 5 minutes the que will start to go red. Technicians do not get paid well and find other companies that pay better.  Pharmacy manager cannot determine pay rate of technicians so we cannot try to keep the good loyal ones who have been there for years.  And so we have to hire inexperienced help and are expected to train them with an already limited number of hours.  "
bad,"*Poor paid"
bad,"Very slow paced every day. There would be a fifteen minute time spurt where a group of customers would come in, but in the mean time we just faced shelves and counting stock/inventory."
bad,Bare bones staffing making for dangerous situations.  No help from Pharmacy Supervisor.  No pharmacist overlap. Many errors occurring. Concerns about staffing met with zero help from supervisors.
bad,"While I was working there, my district got a huge hour cut. That left the store manager to do everything while the cashier rings. That's exactly how it was. While the cashier was ringing, I would take in vendors, put away the truck, break change, count registers, and assist customers."
bad,Tracking Assignment of benefit documents. If we didn't have the document I would call the patients and send one out to be signed and sent back so we could bill the Insurance company for the patients needs
bad,"this company is horrible they want you to learn 10 things in 3 weeks I would not recommend this job to anyone, the training is too short to learn all the system n deal with insurance companies, lack of help on the floor.."
bad,very unorganized company. i do not recommend this place for anybody trying to find a career job. Maybe if you're a college student needing an decent paying job. plus they do not give raises and they have a terrible benefit package.
bad,"My typical day was filled with customer service and data entry.  This also included doing paper work for medical offices and insurance companies.  I filled prescriptions, did daily and weekly orders as well as did the staff schedule.  I had a good and bad co-worker experience due to a lot of gossip which filled the entire store.  The management was not knowledgeable and it took a long time if we ever got answers to questions.  I believe that was the hardest part of this job.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the customer service.  We were a newer and slower paced store so we had a lot of time to interact with our customers.  I also have to say to compensation and benefits were very competitive as well which was a plus."
bad,"Working for CVS/Caremark Specialty Pharmacy was great as far as most of the customers go. The management however, was lacking as far as allowing time off when needed. Also the moral was fairly low, with a high turn over rate as far as patient service reps. Most of the co-workers were nice enough and easy enough to get along with, as well as some management. Hardest part of the job was having to argue with a patient's insurance company or doctor to get medication approved.. The most enjoyable part of my job was when customers called me directly because they liked how i treated them, and that I wasn't rude, and did everything in my power to help them receive their medicine on time."
bad,People were great but very short staffed. Some of the customers were difficult to handle at times but if you were to talk to them in a polite matter they seemed to calm down quickly. Some of the pharmacist were very knowledgeable and helpful to figure out problems.
bad,"I got hired on to a location 40 miles away... Training was another 60 miles from that location. After training, I worked 5-10 hours a week. I didn't even make enough money for gas."
bad,stress caused alot of tension among managers and staff...we dreaded going in to work at times
bad,I'll go after school to cvs pharmacy at my best making sure to work hard to impress the co-workers so they'll put in a good word for me. I learned how to work hands on filling prescriptions assisting pharmacist.Management was pretty tough i made sure i did extra good when they were around. My co workers were the ones i looked up to the most because they had been there long before me and knew more. They made sure i knew everything about being a pharmacy tech before i had completed job corps. The hardest part is when i had to stand for so long it made me exhausted. The most enjoyable part is i got to internship with actual pharmacy technician they made me feel like i was ready to take on a actual job as a pharmacy technician.
bad,"Typical day of work consists of prescription data entry, medication filling, patient/doctor/insurance phone calls, register, cycle counts. Management is acceptable. The hardest part of the job is to work with and resolve everyday customers that have problems."
bad,"My days at work were no where near typical as most people would think. When you went into work, you never knew what was in store for you, because every day or situation was different, customers have different reasons and needs for coming there, and in the health industry things can on a daily basis."
bad,I have never worked so hard for such little pay. Horrible managers and co-workers seem like they don't want to be there.
bad,Very demanding and numbers driven! I learned a lot about the mail order business!
bad,"As a company they prioritized  customer loyalty and satisfaction."
bad,productive and fun workplace with ping table pong table.  long hours but when we were busy time went by quickly.  when everyone did their share of the work things really ran smoothly.
bad,Cvs was great experience since I had been with one company for long
bad,"A typical day at work for me is not a great one. I do have my days where I'm okay with my job, but most days I don't enjoy it. The management there is lacking. There is a serious lack of communications at this company. Always a change in something, I am use to things changing at work from previous company but the changes that go on in this company makes no sense. The co-workers show no teamwork, I have very few people that I know I can go to that I know with help me. But overall I have learned things through out my time. The different formulas that are out there and how serious it is for these patients to get their orders cause its the only source of food for them. Its a different way of helping people than what I am use to. Learning something new everyday is what I would say is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,Good place to work but a new director took over when the original director took over a new distribution center in TX.  New director wanted his own people so almost all employees were asked to leave or forced out.
bad,it is an okay job but not really in balance with my outside life and children.
bad,"I did data entry and rejections all day, every day. The front store manager was a real jerk and had no regard for customer service."
bad,"Work very long hours with no lunch break, while getting screamed at by ungrateful customers all day long! Pay is not bad though. Overall - not worth it."
bad,easy going job co worker  work hard n I like stocking I like working at night get the job done a little faster
bad,its always busy have to keep a smile on to make sure u helping customers. I learn different medicines . my co workers was easy going and hard workers.
bad,Busy IT departments making sure pharmacy claims are processed successfully.
bad,"very demanding company, but good company overall,"
bad,I opened the store in the morning and closed out the day. I did inventory each morning and serve the customer with great service.
bad,"team is a good balance of people"
bad,"I learned how to receive with RF guns, a lot about inventory control including Microsoft Office and Excel, how to drive a forklift and how to drive and order puller."
bad,"Hard to advance in the job, also hard to keep up with quotas, management conflicts."
bad,"responsible for inventory, data entry, and producing medications within timeframe or patients needs"
bad,"Walk in a circle, read an order and put the items in a tote... ship to the store. Open boxes load onto lines for pickers. Load trucks. Unload trucks... really nothing enjoyable"
bad,"No one is willing to help you, no one wants to be flexible with your schedule, no one is there when you need advice or are having troubles with the system."
bad,more concerned about numbers on paper than actual customer service.  not concerned about employee satisfaction at all
bad,horrible place very unorganized. horrible hours pharmacist very RUDE!!
bad,CVS is an extremely busy pharmacy where one is busy from the time they arrive to the time their shift is over. Every one of my co-workers work extremely hard to maintain the constant increase in work load without staff growth. I love the interaction that I have with the customers and helping them with their questions and issues. I am a problem solver and multi-tasker. My customers leave with a smile.
bad,Everyday brought new challenges. The hardest part of the job is learning to handle and deal with rude and unprofessional co-workers.
bad,Customer service in helping customer find what they are looking for.
bad,coworkers are very nice.I would like to help customers  regarding his/her  medicine and insurence related problems.
bad,"If only there was a typical day in retail pharmacy, lol.  "
bad,this qasnt excatly the best job i had it may have just been the worst the managers are horrible they worry about the wrong thing and the time it took them to pay me was just horrible it was 4 weeks before i got paid
bad,The Omnicare site I work for the employees could concentrate more on there work then the gossip; also the manager and HR dept are lazy and do not know how to manger once they have that under control then it would be a great company to work for.
bad,a good company not very great on benefits and salary pay is very poor
bad,"I have worked for Longs, and once it was bought out by CVS everything changed. CVS brought in a more efficient computer system, however, the corporate level is out of touch with customer needs. They continually require us to make more ""outreach calls"", angering customers who get bombarded with useless calls. They grade their employees based on biased performance surveys and arbitrary guidelines that, often, slow down the productivity in the pharmacy. We become so focused on getting high marks for our reports, that we lose focus on customer satisfaction. "
bad,"A typical day at work was always too much workload for understaffed facilities. Good Management, but bad corporate structure follow through."
bad,"I accepted job position as ""Pharmacy Tech"" three separate times, didn't actually get to work in pharmacy till my forth month of employment. Was not told how many online courses I needed to take or that I would be required to drive to different CVS stores for ""training"" . Never got a steady schedule, or any management input to my performance. I love my coworkers, doesn't seem store care for them that much; a fellow coworker retired while I was there and management did nothing special for him. The hardest part of the job is trying to find out where I was needed and when, management is a bit slow. I love organizing the store, putting away product correctly, making sure shelves are clean and organized."
bad,n/a... There is really nothing to say ...CVS hardly cares about there employees
bad,"I was thrown into being a pharmacy technician with no previous training or knowing what to expect. For orientation I had to commute over an hour away for two days, which I thought to be ridiculous because the trainer could go anywhere she wanted to have the meeting. My first week there was the worst and I wanted to quit. I had no one by me training me. I was basically told to learn it on my own. Most of the people there you can tell weren't trained properly either and aren't doing their jobs correctly either. This is scary when their job is in medicine! I will never work for this company again."
bad,this pharmacy dealt more with nursing home facilities in Wisconsin and was all new to me. granted i'm a fast learner it was still a bit difficult and although i was only a temp i didn't appreciate the way i was treated.
bad,"A typical day as CVS Pharmacy was very busy and the standards set by corporate created a stressful environment with faulty computer systems and employees that did not fully understand how to deal with a fast-paced, changing environment. I learned valuable computer skills and inventory skills, while working with customers."
bad,reviewing and approving rxs
bad,CVS corporation has poor upper management support for their empolyees and does not provide their employees with sufficient training and therefore has a great amount of turnover due to loss of new employees.
bad,Working as a Pharmacy Technician at CVS is an extremely stressful position with low wages and almost no opportunities for advancement. Most of your day is spent running around from one station to the next juggling multiple tasks simultaneously.
bad,"This company has good benefits, pay, and work/life balance, but was, in my experience, a very poor model for employment. The company made unethical changes based on a consultant group's recommendations. They also made it clear that you are not to question the changes."
bad,"good fun co-workers, annual pay raises not organized, challenging interaction with patients , never a dull moment."
bad,i enjoyed working with coworkers at the job. I didnt like the recent changes to my job that added on some extra stress. you had serval accounts you deal with on a daily bases and you had to enroll future members without getting the sales person bonus. i didn like the overtime when it was available.
bad,"Prescription data entry, prescription production. 7-10 hour shifts."
bad,very high pressured call center. very rule and process oriented position
bad,At cvs you will put in some long hours of work but at end of week the paycheck was very nice
bad,"Nice stores, good selections & prices. Lack of manpower seems to be the only real issue. Never enough help in the stores. Many times only 2 people are scheduled in the store at a time. Not nearly enough labor to get everything done that the company requires."
bad,"A typical day at work included stocking, picking, loading/unloading, and packing."
bad,Cvs will train you for the pharmacy tech position and then you can take your stae of maryland pharmacy board. This store is such a high volume store and very short staffed. Managment knows this but the hours are not in the budget
bad,Working at three different CVS's and having four different titles the consistencies between stores remain the same.
bad,At this point they are cutting back hours and expecting to much to be done on a daily basis. Pay isn't where it should be for the amount of work they want done.
bad,"I was able to transfer here after CVS bought out my previous employer. I was able to move internally and advance into a better career that paid well. Unfortunately, ended abruptly as they terminated my branch due to company losses last year. Otherwise, lots of room for growth, easy work if you know pharmacy or LTC. Take all the knowledge you can get here and either move up in the ranks or look elsewhere to advance your career"
bad,"The only nice thing about CVS pharmacy is they didn't have a lot of people in the store to work with pay was great hours they gave me a lot. Only complaint I have is the company does not care about Employee safety, I was originally night shift since the store manager felt one person on nights was unsafe, so she hired me on to secure that safety issue void, then management told her she had too many people on nights, so they pulled me off of nights and I was in the wind struggling for hours, went from only weekends nights to every day random hours. The way they did it with the statement of not caring for their employee safety, made me start looking else where."
bad,It depends on what store you work that will determine how busy you are. There were times you had to help a line of 10 people by your self. Understaffed for sure .. 2 people plus pharmacy it was super stressful at times. It was a pretty easy job but boring the same thing every day. The pay is really good and so are the hours.
bad,"I was hired to become a pharmacy technician and went through the program, got state certified and was never offered any hours so I stayed as a front end employee. Store manager was great though! and the pharm tech position had nothing to do with him. Pharmacists were a different story altogether, not impressed at all."
bad,"I've worked at my current store for quite sometime. However, because we work so short staffed I don't feel as though we are compensated for the work we do. It's a high stress job, and you don't even get a simple thank you from your boss...wish I could transfer from my current store."
bad,Most managers were very nice but mine was overly obsessed with customer reviews. Every day she told us what the percentages were and who needed to do better. I laughed when she got a bad review. Her reasoning was that she could lose her job if the ratings were under a certain number and I tried to understand that. She was not a positive motivator.  The longer I was there the more I could see she was not a happy person and would say rude things to me. I'm glad I'm not there anymore.
bad,"There is no free time. When I first started working for this company almost 6 years ago, I was constantly called during my off time to come in. For being such a dependable employee, I was the first person they would call if another person couldn't make their shift. There was no time to do all the work they expected to have completed. The hours have been cut company wide, as they have to make up the money from buying out Aetna. Overtime is never approved, and they would expect a store to suffer for a minimum of 2 weeks before they even consider stepping in to help. Make it work, figure it out. "
bad,"Due to the pay increase, hours have been cut. If you want to be a tech do it at Walgreens/Publix/Rite Aid/anywhere else.  CVS only cares about the numbers with being MORE customer friendly, surveys, flu shots, etc. We have a new way of handling medications where it slows down how we used to do it before. When the snowbirds leave, our hours will be cut even more because hours depend on how many scripts we fill. Less patients does not mean it will get any easier. There are tasks to be done the rest of the day and more hours being cut means the leftover workload will only go the next day."
bad,You can make a lot of money but you'll be every second of every day in constant panic. When I started with the company I had time to spend with patients but not so much now.
bad,my first experience with retail at first it was great until I transferred to another state. I felt like a robot working for them and I felt like they only cared about money and not the patients and workers
bad,"This is my opinion!"
bad,Stressful work environment that isn't healthy for growth.  Managers care more about meeting metrics than their patients or employees.  District Managers are not pharmacist in a lot of instances and so can not relate to issues that arise in the pharmacy.  Company would rather cut technician hours than grow the business by providing excellent service (they always wonder why service sucks but won't increase hours to help patients).
bad,"My career at CVS provided me with a varied healthcare market understanding and how integration is important in the new climate that is constantly changing."
bad,"Very high pressured fast paced job and I loved it. I never lied, cheated, or stole from company. I started as an intern and worked side by side with my partner who was my immediate boss for all but the last few years and together we built and maintained the growth-having cared for 4 generations of some families.  I showed the respect I had always shown to young District manager.  I hired, trained, fired for cause, held responsibility for inventory and narcotics, problem solved for customers and in work place, and loved my job there. Last District Manager was most difficult.."
bad,"This is a fast-paced learning job, however, it is easy to learn. Staff is great, hours are reasonable, very flexible job. Great to apply for if you're a student or needing flexible hours/days."
bad,I was working for CVS while I was a college student in California. They were very flexible with my work and school schedule and had me working 3-4 days a week. My coworkers and managers were especially nice and helped me whenever I needed it.
bad,Management was not good at this company this was my 3rd job it was okay at the beginning then you started to see the true colors of the company. Very hard to move up in this company
bad,"At first the job was very fulfilling, but as it progressed it became chaotic most days and nothing we could do could fix that. The hiring process is absolutely atrocious and it takes an act of congress to get a new hire. Additionally, metrics are hard to understand and even if you did understand, you would be overwhelmed with trying to get the numbers to an acceptable range. My conclusion is if you want to do retail pharmacy, please consider the fact that you will burn out very quickly."
bad,"work life balance negative, work life balance is not very good. the hours at not good. The work culture isnt good but they can do that since they have money"
bad,"Supervisor was fantastic but there's only so much a supervisor can do in regards to demands from management. We spent too much time on money-making ventures (cold calls, mostly) not leaving enough time for patient care. Tech hours are extremely limited (< 1/2 of the day covered) making for a very stressful working environment."
bad,"too much work, too little pay, no appreciation.  I get 10 cents raises.  no incentives and stand on my feet all day long.  get a lunch break just long enough to eat a sandwich."
bad,It is a great start up job if you need more on your resume. not great at giving raises and not great at treating their employees.they can cut your hours when they feel like it which is unfair when you have a family to support. I been working there for 4 years and my raises are at least 30 cents or less depending on if the customers give out great reviews. but the customers are very nasty and they treat you unkindly at times.
bad,Depends on what type of manager and how busy store is.  Some managers allow state mandated breaks while others do not.  You are standing on your feet all day (great work out).  Helping people is great too but you have to realize you are often working with sick people who just want to get their meds and go home.
bad,Omincare had a non-professional and non-team oriented environment that promoted alot of chaos in a busy workflow.  My colleagues did not care too much about the work.
bad,I worked at CVS Corporation for over 20 years and moved up in the company in my time with them.  I decided that the corporate work environment was not for me after a company lay-off.
bad,"This place is has less freedom than prison. You can only use the bathroom during your breaks,You can not have reading material and have to do mandatory over time. Schedules are ridiculous, no back to back days off and working mid shifts. When I got hired I was told mornings would be fine and that if I had to work weekends there would be a shift difference, That all turned out to be untrue. This job is okay for someone who doesn't mind being micro managed, with the worst call center schedules I have ever encountered for typical 13$ hr pay that you can get at a more laid back call center. ."
bad,I don't remember a lot about the job itself I do however remember my management at that time was great.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining isles, greeting customers, and doing overstock. I also did sale signs and processed the expiration dates. I helped with the store cleanliness and was of great assistance to the other workers and the manager."
bad,great place to start a career best place to learn to be a supervisor/manager. learned how to run a store team and reach budgets and goals. best part about job would have to be daily interaction with people.
bad,"Lines of people both at drop off and pick up. About 300 prescriptions that need to be filed within 2 days not including e scribed prescriptions for that day coming in all day, which ranges from 75- 300. Inbound and outbound phone calls. Insurance billing. Filing precriptions, labeling. On certain days there are the loads (merchindise that was ordered from that week) that have to be placed on inventory shelves, out of stock scans for items we are out on, our order day. As our staff comes in from hour to hour I usually direct the staff on where they are to be and what there tasks are."
bad,I enjoyed my job if there were more then one associate scheduled.
bad,"CVS Health is having a lot of problems that need to be fixed on the corporate level before the staff can feel better about our jobs. Each day is like a new and improved version of chaos that just swirls around the pharmacy. It's stressful, we don't have enough trained help, and we don't have enough hours to properly train people. So the cycle just continues no despite the staff's best efforts to train and keep everyone up to date with protocol."
bad,Low pay they prefer quantity over quality. If you're a caring person this is not the job gor you. They dont care about the patients who need their life altering med
bad,Not enough persons in place who knew the business of audiology. Sudden lay off of all colleagues in the field across the country. Would not recommend working for a corporation.
bad,Everything will go well as long as you kiss butt to make it. Skills and common sense are not needed for this job. Management will ALWAYS chose favorites over HARD WORK.
bad,"My boss and coworkers were what kept me at CVS for as long as I was there. The low pay and constant barrage of work caused a lot of stress on my home life as I was constantly thinking about how every day was a mystery in terms of how good or bad it was going to be. I learned a lot while I was there, which was something I loved, but constantly being overworked, underpaid, and understaffed eventually drove me to leave the company, despite how great my work environment was otherwise."
bad,"CVS pharmacy is unbelievable stressful. Do not work here. Run away. If you like to work too hard and not get compensated for it, then CVS is the place for you!"
bad,I loved working there until I noticed and approached management about some things pertaining to care of clients that serviced and got the brush off. I didn't like that and it made me rethink my entire decision to work for a company like that which helped me decide to leave.
bad,"Everyday was different, but equally horrible as the day before. Took ten years to obtain a significant raise in pay. Customers were very rude most of the time."
bad,I’m a order picker.  They pay sucks. Most warehouses in Orlando pay 13 and up. I can’t live off of a $10 salary!! They work u to death and want u to meet numbers but don’t pay well.
bad,Usually on the phone with insurance company's or facilities. Can be stressful. I didn't like it due to the shift i was moved to and was never moved back.
bad,"corporate doesn't care about its employees. Not enough hours, not enough help, deadlines are unrealistic, only care about their numbers. employees are not heard and not trained well enough."
bad,Not a bad place to work if you don't have children because there is alot of over time that has to be worked on a daily basis definitely not a job for everyone. If your hard working and don't mind 12 hour shifts it a great place to make a decent living
bad,when I would come into work there would always be medication that needed to be filled. and customers would be needing prescriptions that have not been done. the pharmacy was a mess and everyday was a battle.
bad,"Not a goid place to work, commonky dysfunctional, little to no help from co-workers and talking to my pharm manager is like talking to a wall. Also they treat the other technicians like technicians  and treat me like im a cashier."
bad,"A typical day includes clocking in, greeting fellow co-workers, obtaining computer credentials to access pharmacy records and fill prescriptions, and heading to the assignment board to view the days' assigned workstation. From there, I work my area to serve customers, working alongside other members of the pharmacy staff, as well as performing other required tasks as requested by pharmacy management. "
bad,"a typical day at work consisted of answering phones all day and "
bad,"working with cvs was a good experience, it was a fun working environment nice people, friendly bosses, the hours weren’t that good. but overall a good place to work for, and with ."
bad,"I only worked in the pharmacy so I don't know if it's better to work in the store or not. Their training program and system for the pharmacy is super efficient, but you won't get a raise unless you ask for it. Understandable, but instead of being rewarded for loyalty to the company I saw others get raises because they wanted to leave. I wouldn't suggest this company's pharmacy over others because they really don't seem to care about their employees."
bad,"i love my Coworkers and my pharmacist. other than it being a retail pharmacy its hard dealing with customers. they never get easier ! not only so but Corporate has literally micro manage every aspect that we do - from ordering drugs from cardinal, harassing phone calls about 4 times weekly , and prompts on the register . just be aware, other than that i has provided me with more life skills , and a stable job ."
bad,"The people at CVS are great. But a lack of communication from corporate and constant firing of upper level staff resulted in never knowing what was wanted from us. Or how to achieve the metrics we were being graded on. When I started we did roughly 250 scripts a day and the full hours for each week were 160-180. Today we do 350-400 a day, and are lucky to get 140 hours. Yet are expected to do more work. Pharmacists regularly work outside their scheduled hours, and spend the entire day stressed."
bad,"I would not recommend this environment to anyone that cannot handle a large workload with not enough help. The benefits are great, but the stress is greater."
bad,typical day working with caremark would include long and some time intricate calls for members to help with their prescription benefit management. nice place to work
bad,"Working for a chain pharmacy, it is what everyone says about working for a retail place. There are a lot of perimeters put on each store and the big shots think more about the bottom line then their employees."
bad,"I SO enjoyed my customers! I enjoyed being able to help them. I was the lead pharmacy tech for 13 years but also done a multitude of other stuff such as open and close the front store,unload truck,stock shelves, straighten and much more.  I am thankful for the opportunity but felt I was being called in a different direction to have a impact on younger lives so I went to supervise at Wesleyan."
bad,in this company is hard to advance even though you are a hard work with a lot of experience. my co- workers and managers are graceful but they only do what they can. l don't have much complaints about the company that l work for but the benefits and salary are problems with this company. right now i'm looking for a good company that can bring me a good salary and great benefits
bad,"-helped patients "
bad,easy to learn the ropes and how things function there in ewa beach longs by mcdonalds. the staff in ewa beach mcdonalds is by far probably the worst ive had to work with. managers are very entitled with alot of attitude. and grave yard shift managers show little to no stability in their work ethic.
bad,"Nice paychecks, but lots of OT.  I worked second shift and felt like I never got to see my family. Maybe for some people, but not me. They do try to show employee appreciation though."
bad,"The typical day consisted of closing or opening the store with a cashier or another manager on duty. "
bad,Upper Management at the District Level was always negative and played favorites. I you ever got on his bad side good luck with ever advancing. Not the best Experience. Store Manager was great.
bad,CVS pharmacy is a great place for people to learn how to be great leaders for the future. i thank the company for making me the person i am today i enjoyed working with the people as co-workers
bad,"I started with CVS as a pharmacist intern for a couple of years & learned the role of technician , then graduated on DEC 2006 where I performed all the function of pharmacist as mentioned before"
bad,"a family environment with great benefits, but low appreciation for high work done."
bad,you will be miserable and feel like your stuck. the money is okay if you're not paying rent. most employees have two jobs to make send meet. good thing is maternity leave but even that is not that long.
bad,"After 5 years of being with this company, I was only earning $11.50 per hour. It was extremely stressful and easier jobs in the area pay better. My managers were great, but higher ups made it impossible for them to pay employees a livable wage."
bad,The pay is very good and the work is very easy. The management is very bad. They do not let you use the restroom more than once or twice every two weeks.
bad,In California it is very fast moving and busy. On top of that the pay is not great and the taxes takes most of you take home money. If you are a pharmacy technician I would suggest working in a hospital where you get paid more.
bad,"Supportive management and productive workplace. 2-4 weeks of training, the rest of the job entails you working on the computer and phones. A large part of the job was data entry from hospitals."
bad,Good environment to work at. Get paid every 2 weeks. You only get  two 15 mins break and a 30 mins lunch break. I cut boxes off a pallet and place them in the bay.
good,I have made some incredible friendships and learned so much about management. Prior to working here I had no previous experience with retail management so in these past three years I have learned an abundance of management skills. I do feel that the company itself should provide a lot more for employees.
good,Management has unrealistic expectations as far as completing the work with very little personnel. Each week we have less hours and with less personnel it
good,"Great for giving you a plethora of Pharmacy Tech experience quickly, but the work environment will most likely be toxic, & breed toxic behavior. They take advantage of hard working employees with almost near open availability without so much as a thank you, and management is less than what it should be. Poorly run company. Everyone is stressed out, because the company continues to expect the impossible, & punishes for not achieving the impossible."
good,The Job isn’t bad it’s the managers who don’t know how to manage and have favoritism. They don’t divide the hours equally and don’t allow employees to move up in position even if they have enough experience.
good,Did not enjoy working here. I felt that it was more of a job than actually enjoying what I did. The co-workers were not nice and the atmosphere was not great.
good,It depends on your manager. Hours are somewhat flexible but they don’t always give you the days off you need for school or doctors etc. Very stressful at times when you needed a day off but couldn’t get it so you had to call out or switch shifts. No overtime. You only get paid sick time if you have the hours and only full time employees get paid vacation time.
good,CVS cares more about the bottom dollar than they do their employees. When they raised overall wages they cut hours in all departments to keep from suffering a loss. This makes it harder for staff to properly do their jobs and keep customers happy.
good,"The management was being driven by the Districts Manager, but was unreasonable. completely understaffed and yet expected to have everything perfect. basically bullied employees"
good,60 hours or more are normal.  Little to no opportunity for advancement.  Training is offered but not meaningful.  Culture is not friendly; its every person out for themselves; no sense of teamwork.  The hardest part of the job is the 60 hours a week without acknowledgement.  Working at home is the best perk and the reason I'm still there.
good,"•	Collaborate with the Pharmacists to ensure customers receive quality care and meet all health safety standards and protocols."
good,Worked the job of 5 employees did not provide enough staff support to meet store demands. Compensated poorly for pharmacy technicians with limited growth potential.
good,CVS was solely a job to make ends meet. The management isn't very proactive about employee concerns. Working as an overnight employee we got the short end of the stick. I had great coworkers and the job helped me build physical and mental stamina.
good,Have been  trying to get them to hire people for almost 5 years not enough help over worked and not pay enough for all the extra work and stress not enough people to help train people
good,"CVS is a very poor company to work for.  The store level management is okay depending on what kind of person you have running the store, but the district and upper corporate managers are not concerned with anything at all except making sales and return customers.  There is no support or appreciation for the employees--the backbone and core of the company."
good,I love to develop relationships with all patients to help the pharmacy be a comfortable environment
good,"I was excellent at this job. Every week I got compliments on how great my customer service was from the customers but management didn't care about that. What mattered most to them was who could be available for on call. At the Time I was a single mother of 2 small children and I wasn't able to come at a spur of the moment notice. The manager couldn't understand that I was trying my best. I love helping others and working in a fast paste environment, the location of this store gave me exactly what I wanted."
good,"I was with CVS for 15 years. After a horrible car accident in which I sustained hip damage, I was forced to take short term leave. After 6 months of approved leave, I was labeled as job abandonment by the company. needless to say I lost my job, after 15 years of full time dedicated service....very disappointing!!!"
good,"The most Ghetto job I have ever worked for. No support from upper management. The pay sucks."
good,"As a contractor you have no security, benefits or longevity at the company, you are employed at will. CVS Health, as a company neither knows or cares who you are, just as long as you fill the chair and answer the phone calls. Management, in the persons of leads, have responsibility for the projects but has neither the authority or power to effect change. This places them in the untenable position of having to supervise and direct a largely downward directed set of actions in which they have no input."
good,"Nice place to work when you need something until you find a better job, schedules are hectic if you dont get a good schedule out of training, management can be way better, pay needs to be higher for the amount of work and the type of calls that are handled."
good,No work life balance especially if you are a parent.Work hard but never recognized by your fellow managers or coworkers. Response to days needed off to take care of things is never given.
good,"a typical  day at work really busy"
good,"Working here was fun at first, then it became very stressful, with constantly changing policies which frustrate the customers. So I've spent a lot of time dealing with upset customers."
good,Stressful place to work. They don't care about your life outside of work. They don't care if you have a family. They would rather hire from outside the company than train the ones already there. Dead end job. Low pay.
good,CVS has been my least favorite job ever. The management changes approximately every 6 months. They promise 8 hour days with occasional over time. They deliver 10+ hour days.
good,"My store was dirty, you could not touch anything on the shelves without getting dirt on your hands. The break room was filthy, there was spilled food and drinks in the fridge that had been there since I started and was still like that when I left. The microwave in the breakroom was disgusting with stains and left over food particles inside. Water fountain did not work and always had things stacked on top of it. My manager refused to give me more hours or train me for management because he claimed he did not have the hours to give me but then hired and trained somebody else for management. I brought the hours to his attention, I asked if there was anything I could do to get more hours or advancement or even more pay, he denied me the hours and advancement and instead gave me a 22 cent raise after being there for 2 years with no prior raises. I called out of work on a day I was asked to come in, not scheduled, because my daughter had the flu and my boss got angry with me and acted rudely and inconsiderate towards me so I ended up quitting my job."
good,Ok if your new and just starting out. I wouldn't suggest staying more than a year as there is no where to go. Too many chiefs everyone wanted to be able to tell people what to do instead of doing their own jobs
good,could be a nice company to work for if the red tape and upper management allowed workers to do their job.  Too many meetings and unexpected timelines hinder proper problem resolution
good,"Connecting with the patients and assisting with medication knowledge was the best part of the job, I learned alot! I would not recommend anyone work for the company."
good,"They have short, fast and horrible training. They train you in a hurry and not give you enough information to do your job. Then they ask you to ask questions but take forever to help you and then reset you. My class had 50 people and we only had 2 or 3 people to help on the floor. They would take 30 to 55 mnt to come by. Then we were required to do 45 cases with no errors with out help. If you were at 43 correct cases and you made one error you would get reset. If you got 3 errors they will let you go. They use medical terminology that they don’t explain until your on the floor. It is great pay, but they need to improve on training.  They also need to properly screen people before they promote them to trainers because they themselves still have questions or don’t work well with people. When I was in training I had a trainer who made me ugly faces and would hesitate to help me. I was not the only one who she did this to either. Just horrible. This would be a great place to work for if they would give you more time to train. They should not reset you and just use your errors to educate you and improve your performance . People would be afraid to call on the trainers because they would reset you over the smallest things."
good,Worked there for 6 mos and haven't seen more of a disorganized company . Half their materials and computers would constantly have problems . They don't care about your personal life and pretty much own you. I worked over nights and there's no management there so people take their sweet time and nothing is completed. Very different from what the perceive to present themselves as.
good,A typical day in a CVS pharmacy for me was extremely busy trying to multitask a multitude of jobs that should have been designated among at least four people. The management there was unacceptable in my opinion.
good,"My time at CVS was ok until the started changing Management. I felt that my time there was a waste , I did not get the proper training to be able to do my best. I felt was being rush, and when you rush a lot of mistakes happen."
good,You get to work and you run around like a chicken with your head cut off. You do not have a set work hours.
good,very poorly managed.  needed better communication between staff and management
good,good for gaining experience. but no room for growth lazy co workers hated working here
good,"Typical day will be in a freezing environment, call/paging physicans for valid prescriptions"
good,"My typical day at work is in a fast pace busy environment. I don't mind working in those conditions because it makes the time fly. The hardest part is multitasking answering 10 phone lines, pulling drugs, counting drugs, returning drugs, waiting on drive thru or registers and entering prescriptions. I've learned how to multitask very well since I started working for CVS in 2010."
good,"A  typical day at work for me would have to be a busy day. I could learn more experience with keeping busy and staying focus on whats most important as far as it being job related. All I ask is that the management team be respectful and fair at all time, and not just when their bosses come around. I strongly agree that I have what it takes to be in management. I am 7 years strong in customer service. Its not hard at all to talk to people with sense. Everyone deserves to be respected as a human being. My previous hardest part of my last job was being professional while working with co-workers. Business and family should not mix. The most enjoyable moment i had while working overall was with my staff, co-workers, and management. We all get together and have gatherings to support one anoother. It make the job we have to do more easier and fun to complete. Team work make the dream work !"
good,"There is no communication, no one takes responsibility for their actions, hire turn over is horrible, management is poor."
good,"Company was great in the beginning but it seems like you only get good hours in the beginning then after a month or so you only get 1 or 2 days a week! Manager was terrible, no oppportunity for advancement. Managers don’t care about employee well being. I will NEVER work for this company again!! NEVER!!"
good,"Company and management very focused on metrics.  Low employee morale.  Support staff hours are being cut, which leads to longer wait times.  Pharmacist pay and hours are being cut as well."
good,"This was a very interesting company that was recently acquired by CVS, so this pertains to OMNICARE more than the latter. CVS Health outsources EVERYTHING and nothing is handled in house. My Supervisor was amazing, my recruiter was too... but my Manager was from out of state, and desperately needs diversity training."
good,Be prepared for high stress and little pay. Full time with little pay and high stress environment. Unwilling to pay wages. Insurance plan minimal. High turn over rate
good,Corporate is constantly cutting hours and increasing the workload. The numbers and metrics you have to meet get higher every month but the support you have decreases
good,"For the amount of patients we have at our pharmacy we are understaffed and over worked. Hours are cut every week which leads to delays in productivity. 1 person is essentially  is doing the work of 2 or even 3 technicians. This also leads to patient's medications not being ready/filled. This also drops down our Pharmacy Score (ratings on how fast, efficient, and consistent we are). This leads to the district manager giving us a visit and asking us why our ratings are low. CVS the company saves money by cutting hours but what they don't realize is that they're not only affecting the employees but also the customer's experience with the pharmacy."
good,"CVS has changed dramatically over the past several years. Their operating structure has been altered to the point of almost one person in the store at any given point. The company has decreased its payroll to the point of single coverage in the front store. This invites theft, poor service and a variety of other issues"
good,"Constantly understaffed, managers are hired and fired or promoted based on who they know, not skill or professionalism. I would not work here if there was any other choice"
good,"At CVS you have to be able to manage daily meetings that are planned and ones that are not. Daily reports of errors, member issues and inquiries need to be completes in a timely manner."
good,CVS will make all kinds of promises how to set you up for success but then feed you to the wolves.  They rushed me though their management training program and then threw me in their worst store.  They did not pay me enough to have a gun put in my face.
good,doesn't care about their staff. only people who gets a great salary is the pharmacist which they deserve because they work such long hours on their feet without breaks
good,"This company is horrible to work for in general. It can be fun depending on which location you're at, which can change daily. The catty women are ridiculous."
good,They'll work you to death and never acknowledge you unless you're threatening to leave. The work environment is usually very tense due to work overload
good,"The company is only about the all mighty dollar and not their workers. We just our tail for them., nothing but crapped on in return. Corporate cares about making money and not about helping employees out. The cut hours in busy 24 hour store and sit back and watch as you get called all the names in the book. And then you're supposed to smile and be nice when customers have thrown out C and B words towards employees.  All CVS does is back the customer"
good,"Depending on what CVS you work at, the stores can range from immaculate to disgusting. Management has you working 5 jobs in one, and if you talk to a customer of the opposite sex for more than a minute you're accused of flirting. This is a good starter job for highschool"
good,"I worked there for a year and a half and in that time had 5 managers, 3 job titles, 4 shift hour changes forced on me, 3 changes on attendance policy, and only 1 raise (of 11 cents) despite getting perfect scores on all reviews and call quality scores. They promised us quarterly bonuses based on our reviews and how the company was doing at that time but the MAX you could get was less than 2% of your annual salary and that's if you got perfect scores, your department got perfect scores, and the company made enough profit to be willing to share. No one I met got more than $75 (before taxes) as a bonus and that included managers and supervisors, PSR 2s, Pharmacists, etc. No one got more than $75 even when they did everything right."
good,The company is being run by former Pharmacists with little actual real-world retail experience.  Promotions are based on showmanship and have very little to do with actual merrit.
good,"During season it was very busy usually a lot to do not only you are cashier, you have to do freight clean and organize, assist customers with photo dept, and if needed a passport picture taken, I think they ask to much of the cashier at the CVS where I worked."
good,CVS is a great job for high school and college students who are seeking part time work. Please note that there aren't any advancements working with CVS. You will forever be in the same position that you started from the beginning. I'm just the messenger.
good,"Working at CVS was extremely stressful, the allotted hours each pharmacy had varied and most of the time not enough hours were given and the pharmacy was understaffed for the flow of customers. Often times I'd be so anxious about the state of work when I got back from  my break. "
good,"I bounced from CVS to CVS to find hours, trained my replacement, and they finally managed to fire me after I had car troubles, so they used it as an excuse to fire me since they couldn't fire me for my disablility."
good,"The employee discounts were decent and it was very easy for me to get my prescriptions filled since I worked right there.  Unfortunately, there were too many people who didn't want to work and other people were always picking up the slack.  Management never really paid attention to certain things and they always have their favorites."
good,"Received and processed new prescriptsions, refilled existing also."
good,Basically you are a underpaid slave....they think that CVS is your life and that you are obligated to give them 2000% and get paid little to nothing!!
good,The company will not allow you to hire enough employees to meet the required scores and rates they want each store to have. You have to do 3 jobs at once because you are always understaffed
good,"Pharmacists at CVS are overworked, especially floaters. Upper management tend to just have you complete modules and sign off to shift responsibility and liability to you. You are micromanaged and are expected to give vaccinations as well as handle a full workload with long lines of unhappy customers, low work morale."
good,"Metrics metrics metrics flu shots. That is it and all you need to know.  But all pharmacies are really the same, especially in retail setting.  everyone is just a cog in the CEO system"
good,"The job was great, Not much of the management. The pay wasn't all that great. After rush season hours get cut. Very busy environment and can be hectic at times"
good,"It was very unorganized, and too many unhappy customers. I did not like working there because the training was horrible, they train you at a very slow pace but when you get to the work floor they expect you to know what you are doing. The pharmacist at my branch was very impatient and rude, and often times was rude and manipulative to the sick patients/customers."
good,"The company itself is great. The management and hr depearent is great as well, but the new promotions into management and supervisor positions are going to have a lot of reliable and dependable workers leaving or getting fired for no reason."
good,The summer is the worst time in the pharmacy. We barely get any hours to the point that I'm only working one day a week for less than 4 hours. one thing I always look forward to is interacting with patients and helping them to the best of my ability.
good,"Typical work day consisted of an unreasonably long list of things to be done, left by the manager. I learned to never become the ""shift cover"". Management was very bad. Would expect their job to be done for them specifically the way they would have done it, when they weren't on the job."
good,"Earned CPhT"
good,"Slow Job Advancement,Fast Paced work environment depending on store location, lots of customer interaction, company is all about making numbers, very strict on attendance even with an excuse."
good,Different managers will give you different answers in regards to the same topic that greatly affect your rates which just so happen to be literally the only thing they care about.
good,This place was okay to work at the only thing that was not a good thing was they had mandatory month end overtime of 10 to 12  hour days the last 3 days a month.It was a fun place they would give us some downtime at work for fun.
good,"When I first started this job I absolutely LOVED it. But as time went on, other employees would just walk all over me because I was much younger than they were. They would hire like 2 and 3 people every month and leave everyone else with 15 or less hours."
good,"There are too many issues with this company. The most irritating part of this company is that they would change your schedule the day of and wait for you to come in before telling you that you're not working that day. Another issue I had with this company is the incompetency. I was a photo technician who was also turned into the head cashier. The company policy is to call for another employee to help ring customers up if there are three or more customers. This was not an issue for me however because I try to be as efficient at multitasking between register and the photo department as I can. When I did call someone for assistance however, I would be berated by the manager for calling someone who was in the office just gossiping with the manager while suppose to be on the floor working. My last concern that I will write about this company is the poor work conditions. They refused to hire any more workers or use the current employees to their potential. Don't expect everyone to be pulling their own weight when working for this company because if you're a new person and someone has been there for a long time; chances are they aren't going to be doing much in regards to actual work."
good,No appreciation to productive employees. Management harasses their employees and not helpful. Pay is very low and there is no increase even when you increase your productivity.
good,management work flow  and make sure scripts are filled fast and accurately.  Deals with everything from insurance to customers to doctors.  May not leave work on time depending on if you can get your stuff done.
good,Pick another store in WV OH or KY just not Kenova. The manager is horrible and will write you up with or with out a doctor excuse. The manager will not transfer you not matter how much you want to be transferred. but she will only give you 17 hours a week
good,"worked there 11 years, hurt on the job then  they demanded me to work 7 days straight, told them i could not with my injury but management would not even work with me so i had to quit,(would be in to much pain and they knew that)  but my first couple of years there was great.the job is rewarding knowing you are helping others, the hardest part of the job was dealing with all the lies. But the best of all is that the paitents did get their meds. I would still be there if all this did not happen.  co wokers are great, hrs could be better."
good,"Need full time hours"
good,I was only an intern and was not paid. I was only doing that for experience as part of Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience
good,"I don't recommend temp to hire within this company. The management doesn't care about its team one bit outside of most of its' hired employees. I experienced poor treatment and disrespect on the job, while witnessing hired individuals resign with no other job in place due to the management. I learned to utilize Outlook and to navigate a multi-system. Got a small bite of corporate America which left a sour after taste."
good,"We were under staffed but gave the opportunity to learn many new things. I appreciated the opportunity to learn and have the responsibility to provide quality services to many patients in need of their medication like antibiotics, pain medication, and enteral formula for many patients of different ages. I also was in charged of tracking pumps use for the infusion and the medication and formula. In the time being in charge of tracking pumps I was able to recover over 200 pumps that were lost, each pump was worth over $ 2000.00. My hardest part of the job was dispatching drivers to make the deliveries on time, We used third party company and it was difficult controlling the drivers. I enjoyed my work because I was helping people have a little better quality of life even thou many were dying."
good,"The only thing that I enjoyed about working here is the people in my immediate area. Management is very poor, they tend to say one thing and then not hold up what they tell you they will do for you. The pay is some of the lowest in this field. They switch schedules without asking the employee. It seems to be very clique oriented and if you are an outlier you will be treated differently."
good,i loved CVS at first caus i was interacting with people but as years gone by it was beginning to be uncomfortable to work at CVS. I didnt like how i was treated and didnt like that i had to work being really sick ...seemed like they didnt care
good,"CVS was a very tense environment because it's a very serious job. There are continuous prescriptions to fill and customers that are in a hurry. There is a lot of pressure because I have to fill the prescriptions correctly and make sure I have the RIGHT prescription. Someone is always looking over our shoulder because you are dealing with narcotics. It's not really fun at all. The co-workers were very friendly, but it's not a fun place to work because it is so intense."
good,Most days are pretty hectic because you are trying to give customer service on top of trying to get daily tasks done so you do not fall behind. I learned alot of leadership skills there along with what it takes to run a business. I loved working with my coworkers although sometimes it got stressful because they did see the big picture on what needed to be done and if that didn't get done it was more workload on me.The hardest part of the job was the workload with the amount of hours you had. Stress was overwhelming and with a salary pay meant many days and nights staying over to get the workload done. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers because I love customer service and building connections with people.
good,"I ran the front counter at the cvs on lane in the heart of campus, on Easter Sunday I was held up at gun point and walked around the stone. The guy wanted me to open the locked cases and pretend to ring him out. After that I became more afraid of our customers and began to make mistakes at the register."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me clocking in, and going straight to the register.  I am mainly responsible for customer service, cashing customers out and filling medications.  If I am lucky, I might get to type in a prescription, but usually the day does not permit.  My boss is a bit overbearing and when she is stressed, she stresses everyone else out, and makes it difficult to work.  My coworkers try and help me when i do not understand, but i think they are getting tired and stressed as well.  I have my bad days and good, just like them, but i try not to take it out on my coworkers.  i have recently been downgraded to part-time and only make $9, and am very frustrated. The hardest part of my job, I think, is not knowing what I am doing all the time, and then when I do ask for help, feeling like my coworkers have better things to do.  The best part, is my customers.  I have slowly began memorizing their faces and names, and when a customer comes in, while I might sometimes get frustrated, Its all about them, and I enjoy helping them."
good,"repetitive work day in and day out"
good,"filled insurance claims."
good,Most of the Co-workers are wonderful to work with. Hours it depends on availability. Management favors certain employee. No movements to advance for long time employees.
good,"The pay is minimum, you do get a raise every year, but it depends on your manger how much. You have to multitask a lot! there is 2 people at the store about 90% of the time, with the exclusion of the pharmacy staff."
good,Had a lot of potential when I first stated then seems like the whole boat started sinking. Detailed comments will be provide on request during an interview.
good,its a hard job to do and as a corporation they give everyone more to do and less time to do it in.
good,"I excelled at this position and became a valuable asset to my store very quickly.  This job was fun, challenging and very faced paced.  I really enjoyed what my co-workers but was working full time hours with no benefits and was compensated at a much lower rate than what was to me when I was hired.  I would have stayed had the company treated me better."
good,"Been working for Coram for awhile now, and have problem with personnel they won't address. Workload is insane as well, and don't pay employees very well."
good,"I didn't have the best experience working here, but it wasn't the worse. While there isn't much of an option of growth in the Pharmacy field, CVS helped me obtain my pharmacy technician license. Management wasn't to well off but there is no such thing as a perfect work place."
good,The company needs readjustment in all aspects. Compensation should reflect the demands of the job.
good,Lack of ethical response from upper management in regards to safety practices/ concerns for the staff.
good,"Overall, Omnicare is a good facility to learn from. Technicians are rotated to different positions enabling one to gain a lot of experience. The down sound is that your schedule can be changed at any moment contrary to what your needs are. Often times you are expected to stay until the work is done even if that means staying longer than your shift. Refusing to stay longer is frowned upon. The pay scale is very poor. Even as a technician with several years of experience and certification it is unlikely you will be paid very much. The turn around rate for employees is very high. New highers to not stay on very long. The environment is very stressful. Management is poor and often times rude and abusive. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your fellow employees and building friendships. The downside to that is we are not expected to talk with one another while we are working. We are made to feel that joking, laughter and enjoying our job is forbidden. The rules are not equal amongst every shift. over night shifts get away with doing less work that falls on the morning and afternoon shifts. Moral is very low amongst management and employees. I personally do not feel the patients and employees matter. I feel that money is valued most and production is about quantity not quality. "
good,"9 to 5, respect others and do your job .  Management shows fravortisem.Not fair to employees.             get alond with my co-workers. getting along with general manager.  Lunch and quiting"
good,I had worked for a Pharmacist/Owner many years ago and It was more of the personal touch. Really get to know people. I enjoy helping people and being ready with a smile because you never know who you may meet that really needs to see a friendly face in their time of need.I have learned alot about Insurance issues that i feel will benefit me on any job i persue.
good,"Overtime was not required, but you were looked down upon if you did not come in ever time you had a free moment because management was slow to hire 2 people that quit. They did not know how to manage employees/workload. No understanding of people getting sick, you still get written up."
good,"A typical day at work is working 5 different jobs in one. It is very overwhelming and if you do not have good multi tasking skills or the ability to meet constant deadlines, this is not the job for you. On the upside, the job teaches you better disipline because of its high demands and deadlines. The management is terrible. They talk about their workers in front of others, which is completely unprofessional, yet god forbid you should express your distate about something they say/do. The management is very unorganized and does not allow you to advance unless you are a favorite, not to mention, management sits right in front of their glass window so they can see your every move. There is basically no talking allowed in billing and management puts it in your review as an area that needs growth. I heard that certain supervisors are better than others, but I have not had the opportunity to confirm that. My coworkers were great in billing, but there are a lot of cliques and a lot of separatism with departments. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management who drives you like a slave to do more, more, more. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work diversity-getting to do many different tasks during the day, making time go fast."
good,"not a fun company to work for, hostile environment, in a nutshell not a pleasant feeling"
good,"Productive and educational experience. Fun to work, good co workers"
good,"I enjoyed it because it was easy going atmosphere if you did your job. What I disliked about the job was others who dragged us down were not fired, but those who didn't were fired. I was training to be a shift supervisor because they wanted me to. The work load was alot for overnight associates who were already tired. But we did it."
good,"The job is decent, nothing different from any other call center. The company is great but management is on the ladder end. Nice benefits, PTO given up front you don't have to build it up. Benefits are not too bad either."
good,"Very unorganized. Upper management does not care for employees. Constant hour cuts, not enough people working to keep up with demand. Allows abuse from customers. Pay is low for what workers are expected to do."
good,Red tape and poor management galore. this company promotion practices are very sketchy. They will add job responsibilities to you without adequate training or support.
good,My store mgr / trainer barely did training. She broke so many rules and ethics violations. The company was made aware of it and she is still there. The company has a good way of lip service but no action for the non Management employees.
good,Salary too poor lack of human concern all the want from you is work and work the careless about you you can't survive with their salary if you only depend on that
good,"Need higher pay, more opportunities to grow within company, take education as assessment for salaries. Consider seniority when job openings occur. Give current associate to apply"
good,"Management does not inform employees when your a new hire on procedures or how the company works, and their computer are the worst i have ever worked with"
good,"The job is like a freight train going 100mph with no stopping. You do not have time to use the restroom or get a drink of water. Management can’t keep people in the building because of starting pay. Walmart pays more and you don’t have to make a percentage. Which is 95% but if you get 94.8% for the month you will be written up. 3 times of that you’re walked out. Bottom line, take your dignity and go somewhere else"
good,"Stores are run so low on hours it is rare you get enough to pay bills.  Favorites of the store managers get all the hours.  No accountability for no call/no shows.  people do it all the time and are still employed.  District manager is turning the district into a 'good ole boys club' and keeps hiring in young males for positions current employees should be getting.  Hard work is unrecognized, store and district managers don't care how hard you work, they just want customers to give good reviews.  The culture is give away everything for free if it makes the customer happy."
good,"They have the most diverse staff I have ever encountered before and the people you work with are great.  You are too busy to really have time to interact with anyone and people while friendly also mind there own business.  So the place is really drama free.  It is not a bad place to work but is very disorganized and you will never get a raise.  You can work from home after 90 days so that is a huge bonus.  If you like overtime and no drama it just might be for you.  If you work past 5:00 pm you get a $1.00 hr increase for the entire shift not just the hours beyond $5.00 pm.  I would go back.  Even though you technically have a supervisor, realistically you don't.  You will never get to have a one on one meeting with your sup. PTO is very very generous, 28 days per year +/- a couple days."
good,"It is idiotic that a pharmacy utilizes performance metrics which have nearly nothing to do with helping patients and ensuring proper medical care, instead prioritizing asinine metrics which focus on attaining quotas on production and timing. This results in many pharmacists pushing prescriptions through without doing a complete job and encourages staff to prioritize these quotas, even at the expense of their patients. Also management, is extremely critical, lacking any inclination to support and build up staffers. Now, there are great  staff members at this firm, but poor management results in high turnover and a lack of trained staff members."
good,"No chance for advancement, no seniority to get hours due to you, good manager. You are a cashier and if at night you must clean the bathrooms, however not any of the daytime staff clean bathrooms and they don't do go backs during daytime shifts."
good,Don't go for omnicare. Its an okay starter job but it nit something that you should want to make a career out of.Management never listened. they choose outside help to run the floor instead of hiring internally
good,"Overworked, underpaid and promotions are based on favoritism. Lack of direction from middle management, confusion on project objectives and deliverables which leads to client dissatisfaction."
good,Company doesnt compare to other insurance companies with pay ..it is lower then normal. not fair for all employees in other departments. you get 1 work from home day
good,CVS is good at giving you a chance to excel. They are not good at letting you make decisions that allow you to help customers or colleagues. The benefits keep getting worse.
good,Definitely has you at times wondering if the profession is really what you signed up for. It is nice to have a job though so because of that I do not complain but I am definitely searching for something else.
good,The management could have been better; tendencies to being belittling.  other than that the place was nice just be careful what pharmacy you choose to be the main one.
good,"steady work flow, ability to incorporate knowledge based on the tools and material use from vocational program. I did not like the idea of selling pharmaceuticals to customers."
good,"This was my first pharmacy technician job. It was a great place to learn but I did not get many hours. However, the staff was nice but not enough time to train."
good,The most enjoyable time of my day at work is helping my nice customers with their medication.The hardest part of my day is dealing with favoritism within my co-workers.
good,The managers were not friendly or helpful. Work was motivating enough. Needed more activity. Would not recommend this place for employment. Did not give incentives
good,Over 150+ calls a day. There's no break between calls as soon as one hangs up another one is coming in or already on the line. Little to no adequate training.
good,"learned about customer service"
good,my job experience with the company has overall been productive. I worked to the best of my ability but no room for advancement. Basic job to work. Nothing exciting. No incentives for employees and management here is horrible.
good,"Honestly if need to just get your foot in the door, then its a quick way to start. Do not get comfortable always have a next step plan. The company does not play fair."
good,"I was unable to receive enough hours.  This along with an incompetent manager, was enough for me to leave. However, i did learn pharmacy codes and how to enter insurance with HIPPA competency"
good,"I loved working as a pharmacy technician at cvs pharmacy.  Not because of CVS but because i enjoy the work of a Pharmacy technician.  CVS has poor managment, poor benefits, poor schedules, and hours offered.  The hardest part of the job was honestly just the simple fact that I strongly disagreed with the way the pharmacy viewed patients as only numbers."
good,"The management and district management is horrendous. The job, any job at CVS is so stressful, more managers change or decline in performance, effectiveness, productivity, reliability and interpersonally. Oftentimes they will grumpy or stressed and will snap at customers or employees in front of customers. Many don't handle the stress well. I know well enough that there will always be bad or difficult managers regardless of the work, but this seems a little too much to blame on reality. Something about the company is very corrupt. The scheduling system or awful. It is unreliable, constantly changing, and very consuming."
good,"The company compensated employees well but did not have a good balance for work and home life. I found myself working late or working from home many nights because of the overwhelming work load. "
good,"Very stressful place to work, and often employees feel underpaid. Management needs to do better when working out salaries and hours.  Hours are unstable, and the job is very hard when you first start!"
good,I've worked at CVS for about 4 years and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Techs are not appreciated and we do so much for everyone. Not worth it
good,When I first started with CVS I was told 6month temp. possible perm. i worked from dec 2016 till feb 2017. we were being told by CVS that we were going to be hired on full time in a few weeks. i signed up for overtime and when i get home i get a call from my temp agency and was told they ended our contracts early and not to go into work anymore. the work was boring. and did not keep anyones attention.
good,"The idea CVS has is great, ""15 minute wait times""  however with the lack of staff and the pressure to get prescriptions out on time made working there hard."
good,being lied to about getting a raise when you get certified and they expect you to do more. corporate is almost impossible to work with. We are belittled every day and just put down at all cost even when we work are hardest it's just never good enough.
good,"Typical day at work is rushing to meet metrics, fixing other people's mistakes, picking up the slack where others just sit there."
good,"I loved the work, but the atmosphere was not the greatest. "
good,Unfairly treated work like a slave no recognition raises suck if you aren't manager you will never make money 17 yrs there and I don't even make 17 dollars an hour
good,"very unpleasant, toxic work environment, depending on the store you work at. Problems go ignored or unresolved until they become unmanageable messes. District Management poor. more willing to pass problems off to each other, then blame the employee when things go south. NOT family friendly scheduling.Not usually given breaks when supposed to, expected to work very long shifts without asking the employee if they can. sick pay has to be begged for,Time off has to be begged for as well. also depending on the store you work at. also very good at decreasing hours below full time, and fully ok with the employee having to scramble to make up the hours if they can at other stores."
good,"On a Typical work day I would tend the cashier. I would help customers with questions and ring up their medications. However i was never bumped up to learn how to use the computer and submit prescriptions and check insurances. I was shown briefly one time , it was so brief that my mind couldnt grasp what was shown. when the time came that they were short staffed and they needed me to attend the drop off window, i couldnt because i wasnt properly trained as i should have been. although i has told my boss that i need to learn, it was pushed to the side as that particular location was always busy. It was stressful because as i was trying to address my concerns it seems as though they wouldnt hear me. So i came to work dreading if i would be told to do something i wasnt properly trained for. I feared every day that i would get fired. I really felt like i didnt have a chance to succeed.Not only that but the schedule and hours given to me were not enough to put food on the table. I was so stressed that it made me sick so i had to leave."
good,Its what you make it.  Pace yourself or otherwise you will be stressed if you are someone who is an over achiever.   Expect to be multitasking from the time you arrive to departure.
good,I work at cvs store 6775 i enjoy it i had the best lead tech and pharmacist i got promoted to another store and there is not much i can say about management in that store
good,"I worked for CVS for 3 years and can say that every pharmacy is different. The pharmacy I trained and work at for most of my time was incredible. Awesome coworkers and an enthusiastic work atmosphere. The pharmacy that I transferred to (for school) is horrible. Night and day difference- that's why I'm leaving. So depending on the pharmacy, CVS CAN be a rewarding job."
good,"Typical retail pharmacy job. It was the same as any other retail pharmacy job.  Just the same old thing over and over again, day in day out.  Just dealing with sick customers and rude co-workers with superiority complexes.  etc etc."
good,"I learned a lot while working here at CVS, however I as well as other coworkers are searching for a new job because we are treated disrespectfully by not only the customers but the staff."
good,I have worked in the front store for years and hated it. The work was horrible and the store head was worse. Once I moved to a pharmacy position I began to love my job.
good,On any giving day anything can happen at CVS Health. CVS is a fast paced work enviroment where you work hand and hand with your pharmacist. There are a lot of duties to accomplish everyday so its very important that you know how to multi task.
good,"No comment"
good,"Great job. They were able to work with my schedule restrictions and I was still given lots of hours. I got certain holidays off and paid time off, which I loved"
good,"CVS is a great company overall, but the pharmacy is a very stressful place to work in, especially with the manager I had. He was very rude and inappropriate in front of the patients at times. CVS pays well, but the pay is unfair in that a new hire can be hired on at a dollar more than someone that has worked for the company for years."
good,"The company has gone downhill in the past three years. Poor management, and praising of the wrong mindset are a part of current culture. Clients and employees are unhappy, and the strategies to change that are archaic to say the least."
good,I worked for CVS for 2 years and the entire time I felted over worked and well under appreciated! The appreciate that I received from the customers was way more than CVS ever tried to provide me!
good,"Useless management"
good,"A normal day at CVS was one filled with the same consistent responsibilities. I entered the store in proper work clothing, clocked in and restocked and organized shelves, recorded what items we needed to order that were selling consistently, as well as products that weren't selling that we didn't need to order. We received new shipments of products every Wednesday, which meant the duration of my shift meant loading and unloading boxes throughout the store. I learned how to complete tasks within a quick amount of time, as well as to stay focused and set goals of what to complete during my shifts. The hardest part of the job was staying interested and not getting bored. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the lay out of the store and products and being able to assist customers with where products were and even the weekly deals."
good,"A typical day included face to face and phone communication with patients, phone communication with doctors and insurance companies, billing insurance companies, working the register, filling prescriptions, and inventory. I learned about different insurance companies and how they work along with new prescription drugs and new pharmacy laws and regulations. I enjoyed helping people and getting to know the patients who were regulars. I also enjoyed working with the co-workers who were helpful when I needed it. I did not like the unknown hours I would get week to week. The most enjoyable part of working in the pharmacy is knowing I was helping people."
good,"This company stands for a lot of good things. They are a good company but they do not provide a good work life balance. They do have peak seasons each year and sometimes unlimited overtime is something that one can participate in and be compensated, however sometimes it is mandatory to work many hours at office and home and can be extremely stressful. "
good,"Intense atmosphere with plenty of opportunity to gain experience in the medical field, as a stepping stone. You will learn how to become quick and efficient, as well as become knowledgeable about health insurance coverage - verifying, processing and understanding insurance, as well as obtaining prior authorizations for necessary DME and prescriptions. There is a fair amount of office politics and lots of red tape, but that is expected in companies/offices in the medical field. There seems to not be much room for furthering your career, and not many hours per week. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers/patients, and working with colleagues as a team to meet, or exceed, company quota for the day."
good,"I enjoyed my job and it was a fun place to work. The employees are very nice and very helpful. The management not so good,and the hardest part of my job was the heavy lifting."
good,"My experience wasn't vey good at CVS. I was fortunate enough to get this job because it was a 2 minute walk from my house. The environment was very dull and negative. I rarely interacted with my own manager. I went to work, did my job, and left."
good,"I truly enjoyed my job but had a very hard time with work balance. Due to workload, I most enjoyed the people and customers."
good,"fast pace working environment love dealing with customers and helping them in there time in need, the staff was friendly love working with them but not management"
good,"Very quiet, very monontaous,easy going, fast paced at times,  morning crew are very up tight and leave a lot of the work for the night crew, night crew is more of a family, easy going and sticks together in time of need, hardest part of my job is hearing a patient is nearing the end, and needs meds STAT'D so the patient can go in peace, enjoyable part of my job is being able to work independently with a easy going laid back environment"
good,"$10/hr sounds like good pay, but there is way more to the pharmacy than filling scripts and dealing with insurance.  Employees are overworked and burnt out often."
good,"My experience with call center customer service. Placed refills on prescriptions for mail order. Assisted members in getting information needed provide the member their medications. "
good,Coram is constantly changing and there is no cohesiveness among staff and management.  Medical Coder and Biller have had overtime and then taken away then made mandatory then taken away it is always changing.
good,"A typical day at work is filling prescriptions due for that day and any upcoming prescriptions that need to be filled, typing and translating any incoming prescriptions, checking in the overnight medication order while assisting customers that come to either drop off a prescription or pick up their medication, answering any phone calls, processing refills made over the phone. I've learned the brand/generic names of most used medications, how to calculate day supply (usage of medication and how much to dispense over what period of time). I have a great management, my co-workers are mostly knowledgeable of their duties in the pharmacy. The hardest part of my job is inadequate coverage for emergencies that may occur where I would not be able to attend work, such as a sick family member or death in the family. Lack of proper staffing adds to the stress of the job as there is more than one station to attend to that may require immediate attention at the same time."
good,employees are severely overworked and underpaid and management does not care about you at all. here youre just a body and that is absolutely horrible
good,"Overall rating three stars"
good,Very busy with very little help. I've learned how to keep a fast pace and to multitask.
good,"A lot of things in the store fall very short of customer satisfaction. Management doesn't communicate with others and are lacking in organization as well. If you have issues and need to report something, it doesn't really help much/at all. It's all right if you can deal with the nonsense."
good,"If you like working under pressure this is the job for you. I found it extremely hard to balance work, school, and leisure."
good,No room for advancement. Promised what you will never get. Late hours. Schedules 3 weeks in advance. If you want time off you have to know a month in advance.
good,I enjoy working with people..the pay is terrible.. i have been here three years
good,"My day typically consisted of:"
good,"The only way to stay sane in a job in the medical field is to have good coworkers. People that you can laugh with, people that you can count on, and people that you can understand when both of you are so stressed only every other word makes sense. "
good,"Most of the employees at CVS were fun to be around. Some of the management left a lot to be desired. They would cut hours for no reason and give those hours to ""favorite"" employees. The job is high demanding and very stressful."
good,Treated fair but other coworkers are not easy to work with and the scheduling is unprofessional and spotty. A typical day at work is pretty busy and coworkers tend to not share the workload evenly.
good,"Retail is retail is retail is retail.... No matter which company you work for.  Management cares more about the numbers than the quality of life of their employees.  Healthcare professionals with advanced degrees are treated like children and micromanaged.  Initiatives are rolled out under the guise of patient care yet their purpose is solely to drive script count.  Arbitrary surveys are used to grade professionals, and we are chastised for a single poor response.  "
good,"It is a very hard place to work.  Over my time working at CVS as a tech, management requires more work for employees while cutting hours available to the store to squeeze more money out of each employee.  I would not reccomend them as a place to work."
good,"I really enjoyed being able to help someone in need but the lack of pay, horrible hours, and problems between co-workers was to much to bare. My manager was very nice but some of the Pharmasist seemed to talk down to techs. Everyday i would ocme into work there would be someone fighting verbally in our area, this got to be old quick."
good,"place was ok to work, but the pay was too low to support a family"
good,a typical day would start of with me behind the counter on the main floor. focusing on customers satisfaction. i learned better communication skills on a daily basis. hardest part would be the ungrateful associates.
good,"Served customers.  Very busy store.  Good employees.  Typical day consisted of many phone calls, lots of complaints, and low morale."
good,"poor staffing, not enough help to do job, curious as to what others think "
good,"Enjoyed working at CVS for the most part. The benefits were great as well as the pay. Working with Customers was also lots of fun. However, Management was not so great. Some rules applied to only certain people (not everyone). Most of the other employees that I worked with were great. The hardest part of the job was working by myself and being robbed 3 times within a 3 month period. I really enjoyed working with customers and being able to help them with whatever they needed."
good,somedays a typical day at work can be terrible some times you get treated like you dont matter
good,Coordinates with specialists and managers at higher levels to obtain information to interface with systems at those levels to facilitate the acquisition and exchange of information technology. Knowledge of the provisions and state-of-the-art IT hardware and software and approaches to networking and interfaces as well as the company’s existing IT infrastructure to determine their applicability and susceptibility for use with the company to resolve recurring problems and to coordinate nightly system updates. Develops systems security contingency plans and disaster recovery procedures.
good,"a typical day at work is hectic and there is no appreciation for hard work unless you count adding more and more jobs onto your plate with no raise. I was advanced to full time out of sheer luck that so many people quit out of frustration with the company. it only took 2 months of working full time for problems to arise with management outside the pharmacy. the store manager became rude, condescending, and power hungry as soon as my pharmacist went on vacation for a week. he decided that without a doctors note I could not come back to work after 1 day calling out. turns out he didn't have that authority. my pharmacist begged for me to come back but I had already made my mind up that it was not the work environment for me. being a pharmacy tech is an awesome job. I love the fast paced environment and the one-on-one customer interaction. I also loved being an inventory specialist (which was my first promotion with no raise) and every aspect of the job other than the tired, over worked and under compensated management. the co workers were very cold at first and almost annoyed when I did not grasp something immediately (and I am a very quick learner). I am still friends with a girl that works there and she is currently seeking a different tech job. she has expressed to me that she is unhappy and again overworked, underpaid. if you have a passion for hard work and dedication, you should definitely consider being a tech, but choose wisely with which company you want to be employed with. CVS paid me to become certified which I was very grateful for, and still am. but the extremely"
good,"I worked at CVS for almost 11 years. I used to enjoy going to work but when new managment started coming in things began to change. they fired all my good help including both staff pharmacist and we lost a lot of business and great customers. They brought in people that had only be with the compnay for 2 years or less and thought they would ""fix"" it up, little did they know it would only get worse. It began taking a toll on my outside life and my health. I would NOT recommend a company like CVS to work for!!"
good,bad experience. Management looked down on employees. Hated this place.
good,They promote you based on qualifications but there is always a loop hole to get the person they want in there
good,"Despite being the most productive division in the country, Omnicare has been slashing personel in Lynchburg, some with over twenty years experience, and degrading service. Accounts are leaving, and more layoffs are comming. Management had failed to replace lost business, and despite a huge effort from the technicians on the production floor, the business is shrinking."
good,A typical day at work starts off with Assisting my clients out of bed into a wheelchair. Once their up and dressed and feed Its time for me to dispense the medication. After medication is taken I clean the area that is surrounding them.
good,This is a Medicare Part D Call Center dealing with Medicare beneficiaries and their Prescription Drug Benefit.
good,"The daily structure is never fully followed by the team because it typically starts in chaos. The amount of volume is not in the appropriate ratio of employees working there. Lots of room for error because of consistent multitasking with the most delicate of things. Poor communication skills among coworkers and no guidance from your team leader in the area you struggle most. You take full responsibility and ownership for your teammates error while not being recognized as an individual for your achievements. Under paid and under appreciated with such a heavy traffic of patients seems unfair. I enjoyed the people I worked with, but alas that is never strong enough to make for a healthy work environment."
good,A typical day of work was not very challenging at all. I felt like I was not getting to put what I learned to good use. Caremark is a company where they do autofill prescriptions. People call in and its all automated and processed and shipped out. I learned rules and regulations of pharmacy. Management showed favortism towards some people more than others and acted unprofessional. Co-workers were fun nice people. There wasnt really and challenging part of the job.
good,"I became very close to my customers and coworkers. We all worked together as a team and became a ""family"". I gained the concepts of working in a fast paced environment where it was truly and amazing experience. I found all aspects of my job enjoyble until I was there for about eight years and was not very recognized after a while which was discouraging."
good,I had a very hard work environment only due to the management that did not want to be there and the staffing problems. They were unable to keep or hire good staff.
good,Working at CVS/pharmacy was very rewarding. Learning how to close the photo department and trouble shoot the machinery when it failed was very interesting.
good,"Constant change is DM's, no advancement opportunities. Average 55 hurs a week as a manager and work by yourself for a minimum 4 hours each day. hours cut every year!"
good,"General manager is very ""My way or the highway"" . Customers are random and people try to steal from there a lot. If you have an open schedule and a lot of patience you'll do fine."
good,They worked me for four hours shifts as the new person knowing I was a mom with multiple children at home. Nobody can live in four hour shifts. I understand being the low man in the totem pole but come on.
good,I worked for this company for 13 years  when CVS bought Caremark the whole environment changed. I made some great friends their and I learned a lot but I’m glad I was able to move forward
good,The district was always struggling for good employees. The supervisor pay was low and managers were consistently having to work six and seven days and cover extra shifts to make ends meet. Very poor work/life balance.
good,Its a joke from the management to the most recent hire employee. The few great rep. Are not acknowledge much less unappreciated they use you as they need to and discard upon completion.
good,"most days are extremely stressful. typical day starts out slower but by the end of the day it's frantic.very rare to get positive feedback, but often hear when you've erred. I don't enjoy any aspect of my job."
good,Work a lot of nights and weekends.  A lot of test you have to take on the computer.  They do not like to pay any overtime.  You do quite a bit of stocking & hanging tags along with straightening shelves and trying to run the cash register.
good,The management team is a bit biased when it comes to certain people. The organization skills are not up to par at all. The collective work is not distributed well.
good,It might just be our store but are very understaffed up front. I’ve ask to not be scheduled on certain days at a given time frame but continually get scheduled and have to miss what I ask weekly to have off for. The store manager never wants to train us if/when they start doing more availabilities for the customers or show us a better way to do a given task to name a couple of things. They force you to work a handful of and open regular hours on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas and only start paying double time around 5 pm and would recommend not working here at all!
good,"Labeled boxes"
good,"A typical day as a Shift Supervisor starts with asking team members how the day has been, and if anyone still needs breaks. Then I continue with counting the safe and change drawer resulting in balancing them out. The next responsibilities I do are price changes, updating displays or fixtures, replenishing shelves, and helping customers through out the day. The challenging part of the job is managing my time to finish all duties before closing. The most enjoyable part is working with a great team to make the hardships easier."
good,"I was with  a seasoned store manager who knew I wanted to be promoted to store manager and sabotaged my promotion.  I did a great job and did everything required of a store manager.  The district manager went along with it because he, too,  didn't know how to lead.  I ended up taking a store manager position at another company and was very successful."
good,Retail is tough and very demanding.  Be prepared for all situations.be honest and hustle like never before and know that there will never be enough help
good,Management and the sups have terrible communication with the staff. If your not friends with your Supervisor you'r not going to move up. Currently looking for a new job because they play favorites. Only positive thing would be the OT. Thats it! I wanted this place to be a career but its just another job.
good,"Working at CVS was enjoyable due to being able to develop my Customer Service and people skills. However, I frankly did not enjoy working under the management I unfortunately had to deal with. Otherwise, my experience with fellow employees and customers was adequate"
good,"Working as a cashier was fun but quickly became tiredsome, hours were decent and often overtime was available. In the pharmacy things were often fast pace and stressful. People would skip lunches, breaks and even work off the clock to get things done. Opportunities were available but turn over rates meant there wasn't always someone to train you."
good,Environment depends on your store location. If you want to advance you will have to be consistent with letting the managers know and even be a self starter in the process towards advancement or else your request will be swept under the rug.
good,"CVS used to be a fantastic place to work. The pace was fast but not impossible, and there was a great deal of emphasis placed on true patient/customer care. Unfortunately, that has all disappeared within the past year. The emphasis now is entirely on hitting projected numerical goals, with both associates and patients taking a lower place in the list of priorities company-wide."
good,"They need to stop hiring people who have the intentions of working in the pharmacy, then putting them up front for 6 months, before they even get to come back to where we actually need help. they also need to give the store more hours so the employees that they have aren't left to run the whole front store/pharmacy by themselves, but yet still only get the minimum 30 hrs a week, work doubles (while still only getting 30 hrs a week), and expect them to want to stay. Also why leave front store management by themselves DAILY for 3+ hrs to run the register plus expect to get their daily tasks done in a specific amount of time. its a bunch of nonsense. its stressful and chaotic. I loved working with my fellow coworkers and seeing our regulars daily. But the pay, expectaions, and demand from cooperate makes me hate Cvs and how they run their company."
good,"Overall working at CVS has not been my worst work experience. For the first four months it was actually a very nice place, as I grew to become family with my co-workers. However, just this month they have introduced the ""CVS Carepass"". First it was optional to sell, leaving employees under no pressure to nag every customer. Then mandatory, and now atleast one a week or you will be written up. Overall it destroyed my work family as we are constantly at each other's throats now."
good,"Very busy,  fast paced depending on the location, friendly work environment. Understaffed depending on the location. Short breaks and long hours, depending on your work availability this may not be so bad in terms of giving one hours to work and make money."
good,Different managers do different things. But I would drive over a half an hour and I tried to get transferred for so long. My hours ended up goin down dramatically so I quit. Wasn’t worth my drive
good,I worked for CVS for 10 years and there is limited advancement. You have to beg and even then your passed over. They are quick to teach you new skills but they just want to pay you what your already making to use them.
good,High call volume. Rules change every day. If you mention something helpful for them they don't listen and do something different. Seen people get fired for being in the hospital. They like attendance to be perfect as it can be. No cell phones allowed on production floor so if you can't stay off your phone don't work here. They didn't pay well and they insurance sucks. You would like they would have awesome plans. Nope.
good,Needs better direction from management in addressing productivity issues with executive. Need more resources in order to be effective with the programs that impact customer service and retaining and building customer loyalty.
good,"Bare minimum, straight out of high school this position is great, or GED only but not for professionals. Even regional supervisors don’t have degrees and don’t know the day to day of being on the floor or doing the job."
good,This was a new expansion within the CVS Health for recruiting employees at the store level and they had poor management teams running the departments that had not had much experience with managing employees
good,Expect to work hard with little to no recognition.  Flexible hours but if working part time expect ridiculously low hours. Upper management looks at staff above the shoulder. No opportunity for growth or promotion. Technician and staff pharmacist hour cuts all the time & Target Cvs expects you to float to find hours on your own. Alot of times they expect you to come in the same day they with very short notice
good,"At the moment, company asks too much from staff while cutting employee hours. Difficult to do task with mainly a 1:2 ratio between pharmacist and technician. Have been getting a lot of negative customer surveys. And store performance score is heavily waited towards customer surveys, like all retail. Well except for Walmart."
good,It is as comfortable setting. Very casual. Management is never around. They change the work process a lot. By time you learn one they change it to another. They set unrealistic goals.
good,CVS is a good company for part time college students or those who are retired and need a part time to keep them busy. The communication is horrible from management. CVS only cares about the customer being right and sales. Many times customers give employees bad survey scores because of products that they weren't able to get and that counts against the employee even though that was something out of their hands. In all there are jobs worst than CVS.
good,Only thing CVS has going is the experience with a very experienced group of people. Advancing is a nightmare. Management is just as bad as the customer sometimes. I wouldn’t suggest anyone stay past a year or two unless you see yourself by being a slave for the customer and corporate entity
good,"This pharmacy i worked in was so out of order. The written prescriptions were not in alphabetical order. It was impossible to find the drugs since they weren’t in order either. The staff was careless, thus leading to delays in getting patients their medications."
good,"Cvs is really a good company to work for I just so happen to have the most rude and unprofessional, inconsiderate Manager. you will be subject to a very open schedule"
good,"The company is just like a lot of others now. They gave all employees raises, just to cut hours a few months later, and then again a few months after that. if you're looking for a career in pharmacy, this may be a nice place to start, but not stay."
good,The management changed more than 5 times in my 10 yrs of employment. Instead of hiring from within they would bring outside managers in who either had no knowledge of how a PBM works or they had a bit of knowledge and didn't have good management skills. This company will make exceptions for some and not for others. It's not what you know but who likes you and wants you in a certain position. I started from the ground up and ended my career here as PSR II on a traveling conversion team with the hopes of working from home remotely which ended up not happening. The only option given was to be a pharmacy technician I entering scripts.
good,"Perform all register transactions in accordance with company procedures • Process cash, check and charge transactions"
good,Joined front end with hopes of moving to pharmacy after time. I don't think it would have ever happened unfortunately. Management changed suddenly without warning.
good,"It could have been a fantastic place but our store was not given enough hours to fully staff. Stocking shelves all over a store when you are the only cashier and have to cover the front registers was a nightmare some nights.It always seemed to pit all the employee tasks against good customer service (which seems to be common at most retail stores). The store is open 365 days a year so holidays don't happen for the front staff. If you work in the pharmacy most holidays are off to my knowledge. If you want to advance from customer service there were not a lot of places to go other then manager or assistant manager. Assistant manager was mainly a training ground for managers who would be assigned a store, it did not sound like you would be allowed to stay in the store you trained in (note - this may have changed, this was in 2014)"
good,"typical work day is 930 to 6. 2 minute calls unless it's escalated or a transfer. Run claims for pt and checkout the prescription status and insurance information. Outbound calls to insurance companies, pharmacist and technicians for order completion. Average management. Low pay. Enjoyed helping people."
good,"First, let me start with positives:"
good,"Cash posted  "
good,A lot of drama at my location from grown adults . Very unorganized . Too much favoritism . Unrealistic expectations just to reach the daily quota of calls .
good,"Working at cvs is cool especially for a college student. I was able to work about 25 hours, all while going to college full time. flexible scheduling and my coworkers were great."
good,"I have worked in all possible shifts in this store, including 4 months in the overnight. I currently work in the afternoon shift. My work consists in manage the most sold items in the store: Grocery and snacks. My activities include receiving providers, vendors, ask for supplies and manage the financial status of the store. As I start every day, I count the cash from the store. At the end of the day, I count the cash again, deposit it and ultimately do the paperwork and documentation of the worked day. Additionally, I have to be attentive and ready for customer service during my working days. For me, it was a great deal of happiness to become the best employer in customer service for three times during the last four months."
good,"The retail pharmacy atmosphere is very stressful at times, especially in a very busy store. The district manager that oversees the York, PA area is horrible to the employees and PICs. Exceedingly high expectations, and is known to watch the cameras for minor details just to put the crew down for something small - such as not wearing a tie. You always hear about what you're doing wrong, but receive not a single bit of recognition for when you succeed. Pay is horrible."
good,"stressful on the daily basis, not open or listen to employee concerns, procedures seldom or changed on regular basis, productivity is high on their list"
good,"Chronically understaffed, management oblivious to the challenges for the other shifts, unreal expectations of what is capable. Doesn't listen to suggestions."
good,"Coming from Carlsbad CVS they helped me earn my license and gave me the opportunity to move forward. I got my training in every area needed. Moving to El Centro CVS ymas was a huge change with the busyness they endured. I am thankful they gave me the opportunity to keep going , strive to be better every day"
good,"Working at CVS was relatively easy. You cashed out customers, helped them find products in store. Occasionally dealt with them over the phone. Maintained a clean and organized work environment etc. Nothing anyone couldn’t handle except management makes all the difference! The manager who hired me was great! He made the work place fun and time fly by. He was later replaced by this woman who made everyone’s lives, (customers included) miserable! So just be weary, CVS could be a great place to work at it just depends on the people you work with."
good,manager was awesome along with some of the employees but the work was too much for too little employees and very very fast paced. and comes with alot of headaches but if willing you can learn and progress with time.
good,upper mgmt doesn't appreciate their employees so many people are leaving the company cuz the stress level is ridiculous. expect so much to be done in short time and continue to add more tasks and they cut hours.
good,"This is a great entry job into the work of pharmacy. They will just about anybody and train you as well. However the lay is very low and only enough for a teenager. The raises are funny. Anywhere from 2-8% raise. If you are not the lead tech/ inventory tech you will never get that 8%. Hours are all over the place, not enough . ... but you can pick up hours at other CVS’s to get you to the 40. However that’s a headache as well. My advice is to get hired, get trained, stay maybe a 1 1/2 yrs to get a good understanding then BOUNCE ...if you want to make any money start looking into long term care pharmacies, hospital, insurance companies, IV/ compounding pharmacies. Walmart and sams club start you off at more money as well once you finish training but the hours fluctuate still making that not enough. 🤷🏾‍♀️"
good,Employee discount on store brand % 30 and %20 off anything brand.  Not a lot of full-time employees most people are part time/as needed. No breaks less than 30 minutes. Always working long hours.  The pharmacy manager is actually good about most situations and handling the volume of the store the other pharmacist don’t seem to be able to hold things together as well as the pharmacy manager.
good,I would have stayed there a long time as it was close to home but was hired as claims specialist and then promoted to a supervisory position which meant I worked lots of unpaid OT nights & weekends.
good,short staffed most of the time. upper management is not concerned with patient safety. workplace has a culture of anger and bad feelings. staff was hard to get along with each other.
good,"I learned long term care pharmacy, intake and how to get overrides and authorization from various pharmacy benefit managers and Insurance companies, so I would say the experience was great."
good,"Prescription Data Entry work. Long hours sitting down, thirty minute lunch allowed with two fifteen minute breaks. Initial team supervisor allowed certain behavior from favored team mates. When replaced, new supervisor micromanaged seconds. It was understandable, as she was trying to cull the lazy workers and keep the best workers. She wanted to improve quality and quantity and weed out those who could not make the cuts. One mistake major is allowed, out of 700 prescriptions. Mandatory overtime happens quite often. Saturday overtime happens, so does Sunday overtime. It can happen last minute or quite suddenly, so prepare to cancel that beach trip. Pharmacists were very professional, however. Culture is quite cut-throat. If you can't keep the pace of 60-70 prescriptions an hour, with one major error out of 700 prescriptions in the first three months, you are not cut out for the job. Watched a faithful, long-standing pharmacy technician who was with the company for many, many years, leave out of frustration with management and the micromanaging. On bad days, or sick days, you are expected to perform. With outrageous, dangerous weather, you are expected to show up to work."
good,"This would have had a better review  but,"
good,"It's really a fast-paced work environment, extremely competitive and they go through employees very quickly. Each store is different and the people you work with depends on each store."
good,work with all ends of the healthcare industry and Doctors offices pharmacies and Members assisting them/ or the Doctor's office  in getting reimbursed for Vaccines and Self administered Drugs
good,"Never are you celebrated for any achievements in your career with this company. Job security is lacking greatly, and the turnover rate is the highest I have seen at any company I have worked for. Pay benefits and healthcare options are nice with this company. If you are not prepared to be worked to the bone with no additional compensation other than a check, then this might be the place for you. Do not expect much more other than maybe a good job here or there, but they really do not appreciate the amount of work you do for them regardless of how hard you are trying."
good,Job is decent and pay is ok for the stress. management could be a little better. business needs is always priority with very little understanding for uncontrollable life situations.
good,"it is stressful work, lots to get accomplised but little to no staff hours to provide the customer service that is expected to meet goals. teamwork is not a work know"
good,"Pay is poor in comparison to other pharmacies, great starting job in the field but very little room to grow. Not valued enough as an employee, benefits are not very good"
good,"this place has go to be one of the worst places Ive ever worked.. the absolute worst training ever, peers have no time to save a sinking colleague. it was terrible."
good,"There isn't much to say about this company. You work hard, sometimes the hours are inconsistent but the people are nice. It's a fair balance. You can ask for extra hours but are unlikely to get it. Definitely good for a a high school or college kid."
good,Management tends to look for something wrong in individual employees. If you are not liked by certain managers and you make a mistake they are going to find a way to get rid of you. Sad to say but very true.
good,"I would rather not participate in providing my opinion. It is all in the eyes of the beholder, if a company presents an opportunity and will fit an individuals career goals."
good,"It is a very busy place to work wish is awesome, but they sometimes take it to the extreme till you are overworked. They set unrealistic expectations and they sometimes bite more than they can chew, they workload and manpower is totally not close to being balance."
good,Too much stress not enough pay. Always put 110 percent in my job for nothing.   Felt was not appreciated. Maybe another location would be treated better. Pharmacist were awesome. Not store manager.
good,"Both in stores, and in offices the leadership is lacking.There are many opportunities to improve within the company and I would like to see a bit more accountability on leaders within the company."
good,"The cons outweigh the pros. There is an unfathomable lack of management at this location but even more so a lack of respect for technicians from ALL upper management. We were short staffed so technicians were expected to work longer than their assigned shift. "
good,CVS Health is a good business the hours are long and some management issues.There is room for advancement and the team work is outstanding but communication is the key
good,"Hey all, I love my job dearly in terms of being a pharmacist only since I represent myself as the patient's healthcare professional friend who wants to support each and everyone with proper guidance. Now in terms of business perspective, they really don't know what priority means except using numbers to just make us feel bad at times if we do not reach to the goal as a team or individually and also we are marked as not performing well. I have worked for another company and I haven't felt this bad as I had felt while working up to 3 years with the CVS company. I must say that money and profit and loss are highly meaning to them regardless of how much they say in terms of patient care being important. Now in terms of Time Management, how can you expect as a leader for an employee to complete something when you are either in a busy area, or have staff that really takes time to complete work or in a rural town where only one CVS Pharmacy exist unless you travel 40-50 miles from the town for another one? I prefer if we personally tailor the needs of employee along with the patients then it leads to harmony. I personally have tried it with my employees and my patients, it works out. I love the company, but I guess people who manage this aren't properly trained like the way I wasn't trained for the best. But, I will not give up, I will persevere and learn to be a better leader and not a boss. I appreciate for giving me the space to write my review, it may make sense to some and may not to others but personal approach with kindness and gratitude will work longer than bossing anyone"
good,"When I first started working here, I thought it would be a fun place to earn some extra money on the side while I go to school. Boy was I wrong. I don't know if it's just the CVS I worked for or all CVS stores, but the pharmacy was VERY understaffed. My shift would usually be from 4-close which is arguably the busiest time for people because people would be picking up their medications. You'd think this would make the manager want to keep more people in the pharmacy at this time, but this was not the case. A lot of times it was just me and the pharmacist working and I would have to run back and forth from the drive thru to the pick up in store to get people their prescriptions, while there was a long line in both. People would then get angry at me because they had to wait so long, and that did not help me wanting to stay at this job. The few months I worked there were awful and the other technicians who I got trained with, quit and started working at Walgreens. That should tell you about the working conditions at CVS."
good,I worked overnight and did my best. I was passed over many time for a possition because the manager did like me personally. He played favorite with all the emplorees
good,"I was never given the proper tools to perform my job duties, training is extensive with no real payoff. People working there longer know everything and they aren't even willing to teach new employees anything"
good,"So many classes you have to take, so much work you have to do to reach the final step. its very interesting job but people make the difference in every work place."
good,tedious time consuming data entry chill environment though as long as you get your enrollments your safe I like the way the management actually treats you as a person
good,Just get it done was the culture of this company when I was employed. You are just a number and when you advance to a higher pay it feels like they are pushing you out.
good,"In and out all about the numbers. Nearly impossible to become familiar with customers as they are numbers, not faces. Pay is fair and insurance is good. Multiple job titles for CPhT so advancement opportunities are there."
good,You are a retail pharmacist.  You verify drug orders from prescriptions and dispense to patients.  You know what this job entails if you are also a pharmacist.  CVS is a large corporate entity that has no loyalty to you.
good,"The pharmacist pay is probably the highest, but the caveat is that you work a varied schedule with limited technician help. A typical workday depends on your team. I have worked with the good and bad, but understand that your technicians are not properly compensated for all that they do so there is high turnover in help. You get a paid lunch, but the pharmacy remains open."
good,"decent place to work, but they don't pay enough or have enough hours for anyone, personalitys in my cvs made the experience rough but the customers were cool"
good,I have learned a lot at CVS that will help me with my pharmacy career. it is a fast paced work environment . In order to work there you have to learn to be a great multitasker which now I am.
good,Cvs was a bad experience for me. It was all about drama instead of work. They had me do everything there is it just wasnt fair. it wasnt a good place to work at and I would never work there again.
good,"The store I worked for, has a swinging door of employees. In the pharmacy alone, 6-8 people quit in the matter of days.  Management an employee interactions outside of work. Managers not being neutral between parties and delegating issues. In fact, knowing there were issues, never handled them at all.the staff who have been there longer, have way more leverage with not having to do things, making others clean up after them. As long as you have a store, where everyone's equal,it's a good place."
good,The job was very stressful. Speaking to a customer if you stayed on a call to long it could cause you to lose points. I felt the job was rush rush but give the best customer care possible to each and every customer day by day or during the day the wording to a client could change. just a little busy.
good,"No breaks.."
good,"I took this entry level position to get my foot in the door and see what the company is all about."
good,this job really has you doing way to much for the pay they give you and they are very unprofessional. they are very strict when it comes to there rules.
good,"unorganized overall, and in every single way possible. Unprofessional and inexperienced leadership. Un positive, generalized management or communication habits. They are constantly understaffed due to manipulating large amounts of work, not mentioned in interview/with no additional or increased pay."
good,"Culture of company sucks! Very high pressured environment - only one day of remote work allowed. Employees are very frustrated and burntout!"
good,A typical day working at cvs was very hectic customers are constantly asking questions your'e on your feet for mainly the whole shift what I learned working at cvs is that when you build trust with customers and help them they're more likely to come back based on their experience the management was very helpful during your shift you have 1 shift manager with you and maybe two coworkers depending on how busy and big your store is the hardest part of the job is when customers are not pleased
good,"This pharmacy is not a place I would recommend. Very demanding with constantly changing policies. Management coasts while the rest slave away. If a problem occurs, their is no one to turn to for help."
good,Standing for long periods of time and taking care of all the customers in a timely manner.  A very busy store.  The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing all the work requirements by the end of the day.
good,A typical day at work was a nightmare. I learned I could deal with any situation and solve a multitude of problems. The worst management. The co-workers were hit or miss. The hardest part was bad pay and very stressful. Work came home with you. The most enjoyable part was having some regular customers that I looked forward to seeing daily or weekly.
good,I got tired of working for CVS. I was excited to work there until they had me working like a slave. I want a new job. I want to cook.
good,"I enjoyed working here at the beginning. Once the new(inexperienced) Pharmacy Manager came into play, I was no longer satisfied. He was very ill tempered and very unprofessional. He makes everyone uncomfortable. I would have been happy there with the first manager we had."
good,I really have nothing to say. Is really nothing to say I don't work there any longer. At the beginning it was a good company to work for but after a change on management everything change and it wasn't that great anymore.
good,assist in filling scripts answering phone calls customer service at registers handling insurance issues ordering medications inventory managment
good,"My immediate manager was very good. She encourages all her subordinates to excel in their work."
good,"I believe that CVS was a great opportunity for me however, there is no advancement there. They don't really care about their employees."
good,"I have been with CVS for almost 2 years now and have moved up pretty quick however, the compensation is not worth the work. I love the people I work with but CVS as a company pays horribly and I think at the end of the day, they really do not care about the employees. I got lucky by working at a great store but there are others stores I have worked at that are horribly run."
good,"Very little got done overall, and the corporate office seemed to have little idea on how a store should actually function. It seemed almost like the company cared more for numbers and ratings than it's employees and customers. The store manager I had was excellent when it came to people, but his professional management skills were lacking, as such things rarely got done on time, and there were issues with several employees not doing their jobs."
good,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians if you ask me. Witnessed a lot of favoritism from various levels of management and there's not much flexibility with scheduling.
good,crowded busy less hours for a week without a decent pay rate. not many things to learn on a daily basis when you work as a sales associate/cashier coworkers are not a friendly team to go further your skills. 30 minutes unpaid break.
good,"hostile work environment, management listens and try to work on everyone needs, unstable work hours, work loads are a burden on one person, very under staffed."
good,"work-life balance issues"
good,"The management promised things that it didn't keep. They flat out lied to try to get you to do things and you weren't rewarded for hard work. My co workers were great. They were willing to help if I needed it, as I was willing to help them, they were as shocked as I was when I wasn't hired in and someone with no experience was hired rather than someone who had been there for a few months. They didn't even bother to tell me that my job would be ending, I found out when the schedule was put up for the next week and I wasn't on it.. "
good,I really enjoyed being a Pharmacy Tech; but the environment in which I work was very unpleasant. And some of the employees were inconsiderate.
good,its ok. I have no complaints really abut working for cvs health. really just depends on where you are located and who you work with.
good,I learned a lot of different things in retail while working her. I also learned how to multitask and be able to focus on many different things at one time while always paying attention to a customers needs.
good,"First of all, retail pharmacy is a tough business. Not only to you have customers berating you at every turn but corporate pushing things that only make your job harder. Working in a retail pharmacy is NOT for anyone. That said, CVS is not much different than any other large retail chain. Money is everything to them, not employees."
good,learned a lot working there as far as how to run a business as well as how to develop a team.Workload to pay ratio is low. Information necessary for daily operations does not become available readily
good,"un willing to help employees learn job fully, "
good,"They give you a base training and give you a month online to get it all and periodically give you tips, but if you have children or family commitments forget it because they want you to be at work each day no matter what the emergency; even if the governor declares a 'state of emergency"" in your area if you are not there you get an occurrence.  On your reviews you have to be an 85% or better and with their system of distribution, that is impossible to maintain each quarter because your transfer rate will stink as well as trying to sell CEE opps, which they have a team for."
good,"While working there I did not have access to a lot of the programs/ equipment used to assist callers and when I reported it, nothing really happened so it was kind of hard assisting callers because of that. The Senior Team was horrible and it was really frowned upon to go to them for assistance because if you reach out too much they will write you up. but overall the pay was good and coworkers were very helpful when you could not go to someone above you."
good,i love the work i do and the people i work with. I may  not agree with some of the Management decisions or company decisions.
good,"Typical day...Constantly busy"
good,"An ok workplace. The experience is good. The patients are very friendly and for the most part easy to work with. I perform duties such as working at pickup, drop=off, production and drive-thru. The hardest part of the job is learning how to put insurance in the correct way."
good,Working at CVS I loved seeing the regulars come in and chat with us for a few minutes. Management is not the greatest.
good,"long hours, on feet all day or in a truck on the road. lot of prepackaging of pills and creams."
good,"Must be able to multi-task and work well under pressure.  Answer phone, a must is quality customer service."
good,"Management doesn't diffuse inflated situations"
good,"One thing I can say about my work experience at CVS Pharmacy is that it was a great learning experience.  Not planning on becoming a Pharmacy Technician, I started out as a cashier and was given a wonderful opportunity to develop a highly diverse set of skills in customer service, management and employee relations.  Since retail hours are relatively flexible, I was also able to continue going to school full time while also working full time. Also, since I was employed by the pharmacy, I was able to pursue National Pharmacy Technician Certification at no personal cost to me, something which can be upwards of $2,000.  This certification, combined with the flexible schedule and work experience allowed me to grow into an employee well suited for a variety of job opportunities."
good,i was with cvs for almost 10 years. I was with them through a lot of changes and I cant say any of them were positive. They got away from caring for the customer and started focusing on how we can keep the customer coming back. They would cut hours regularly and drastically yet still expect to meet ridiculous quotas. They started implementing a numbers/percentage phase. How many phone calls were made a day etc.
good,This company was ok. The time I was there I saw 3 managers. Some employees had no accountability. I enjoyed the job because I know what I was doing was helping other people. There is little room for advancement.
good,"On a typical work day at CVS pharmacy you clock in, speak and chat with co-workers for a brief second and then you immediately dive in. You can have a great day or you can have a horrible day. Most of the co-workers go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. In my 3 years of being a CVS employee I've learned a lot, I've learned how to improve my customer service skills, I've expanded my knowledge in pharmaceuticals, and I've also learned how to wear thick skin."
good,"A typical day at work here meant that I would complete multiple tasks.  This would range from opening the store and cashiering, unloading and stocking truck supplies, completing and processing pictures, helping customers find merchandise and also upsaling.  Handling incoming phone calls and vendor sales were also included daily."
good,"Our pharmacy averaged 3,500 Rx's a week(beating any of our regions other stores by at least 1,000) and we had our hours cut. Not a very open company to the staff at store level(we were informed by the news stations regarding discontinuing the sale of tobacco). If you could breathe, you were hired by the front store for pharmacy without the pharmacys knowledge. Co-workers were mostly friendly and helpful. Our Pharmacy Manager had explosive anger issues that allowed him to physically be a threat to his employees and was never disciplined."
good,"The overall experience was ok. I learned how to use a cash register so that was a plus. Also I met some wonderful customers. But as far as management and staffing is concerned it was very unprofessional. There was a new manager every week, a bunch of sexual harassment and stealing. It was crazy and I had to get out of there ASAP"
good,"I worked diligently to maintain the extremely rigid time table of my duties as the only pharmacy technician at my work site.  Many of the duties or tasks given to me by the managing pharmacist were not usually performed by a technician.  I took great care to be sure all assignments were performed accurately with little to no need of direct supervision."
good,"Once the Branch Manager changed, the overall atmosphere changed. Most staff were paranoid about losing their jobs."
good,No consistency. Too much politics. No loyalty. Enjoyed my patients that I cared for.
good,just have not been very honesty about the type of job I was getting into and did not tell he how many hours to expect and cut down to 4 hours
good,"A typical day as a Pharmacy Technician at CVS Pharmacy included the following; assisting pharmacist, filling prescriptions, data entry, customer service, phone handling, money handling, inventory management, faxing, filing, stocking pharmacy inventory."
good,Very fast paced environment where I have learned a lot. I would have to say the hardest part of job is not having enough staffing hours to do all tasks that are assigned to you. I love interacting with patients
good,"A typical day at work involves cashiering, Photo processing for customers, price changes, signage, stocking merchandise.  Management is good to work with as are the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is re-setting Planograms and understanding them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers who are our regulars."
good,"Great opportunity to become a CPhT, however, not the best place to work. Very touchy over head management. Typical work day is mediocare. Once something goes wrong, as in a pharmacy being robbed, management does not ask how staff is doing, just an inventory of drugs that were taken. Not a promising place to feel comfortable with backing from above."
good,cvs is a good place to work. but the money is a problem. you work too much for the money you get.
good,Dont get me wrong be cvs as a company as a way of doing thing to where none of thier cashiers of full time and wants them to be able to run a store on there on while the manger is sitting down doing nothing on the phone.As a cashier your job is to be on the cashier but not there.Your somewhat a manger because you do taskes that mangers do.Which I find that is wrong of them and because your part-time you get no benifits.
good,"CVS has instilled in me the ability to multi-task, problem solve, and produce in an instant.  You must possess acute problem solving skills to provide service in this amazingly fast paced work environment.  Communicating and counseling to a broad spectrum of ages and walks of life is another key role as a pharmacy technician.  CVS, in my opinion, has provided the training for me to succeed in any work environment. "
good,Got heart? Its all u need to work at cvs. Fun people to work with
good,"Effectively resolved insurance rejections and other billing issues. Entered new patient profiles and prescriptions into medication input software system. Provided friendly customer service at prescription drop-off and pick-up counters. Worked closely with pharmacists and used medication input software to safely and accurately dispense medication. Efficiently answered multi-line phone and processed high volume of order requests from nurses, doctors and pharmacists. Regularly stocked shelves rotated stock and checked for expired medications. Efficiently operated cash register and handled cash, checks, and charge transactions. Reconstituted oral liquids. Strictly maintained customer and patient confidentiality."
good,"No consideration of working schedules.  Regular RPh worked one day on, one day off, fourteen hour days not including travel time.  Floater consistenly scheduled back to back with one hour drive time to each store, making a 14 hour day a 16 hour day."
good,"A typical day at work would be answering the phone, giving customer support and service at all times. Making sure the shelves are stocked, clean and faced. Maintaining the Photo Lab.Thou I learn a lot at CVS , it was on my own without guidance."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and making relationships with my customers. The job itself can be stressful in comparison to the compensation package. Excellent pharmacist. 
good,"-Working the cash registers."
good,"A typical day at CVS is usually very demanding. With the high volume of patients that come to the pharmacy, it can be a little stressful with us being under staffed. However, I've learned that If you concentrate on the tasks at hand, things usually go pretty smoothly. As with every job, you're not always going to agree with everything management tell you, but I find that it is mostly fair at my job. Most of the co-workers are a pleasure to work with. They often make the time seem to fly by. All in all, not a horrible place to work at. "
good,"Retail jobs sucks.Under paid, under staffed, over stressed..Insurance problems ( no one wants to pay one darn dollar for any med.. They want everything free!)"
good,"Because of high turnover, employees are treated like just a number. Everyone is treated the same regardless of work ethic and as if doomed to fail. The work is not difficult at all and is busy so the day goes quickly. However employee feedback is not even considered, one manager stating, ""you should be glad you have a job""."
good,"This was a tough graveyard position, which paid minimum wage. I learned a lot about inventory and currency deposits, and how to manage a retail store."
good,"The managers seem overwhelmed & in turn overwhelm their technicians...I've learned a lot with cvs, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers attitudes qhen they can not receive their meds because of lack of their doctors authorizing refills because they want them to come in for appointments, I love helping everyone of my customers whenever possible."
good,"manage team of 4 professionals. maintains store staff job results by coaching, counseling ,and disciplining employees. effectively managed payroll and timekeeping, including completion of the proper paperwork for new hires and terminations."
good,"I really enjoyed the work; however, the management seemed to be inconsistent and ineffective."
good,"I worked in Pgh, PA for many years, when I started our health benefits were paid 100%, then as time went on the employees had to pay a portion of the cost for medical benefits which was increased yearly & the employee raises were never enough to absorb the increase so each year my bring home pay was less than previous years due to increase in benefit costs. There was a female ED who was very foul mouthed & very crude. She was, extremely unprofessional, her conversations were very unwelcomed & no one would do anything about it because she was an ED. Promotions were not always given to those who knew the job best & could really manage a department with thier experience & expertise. The Co-Workers were the best part of my day, they & my patients were the reason for me staying as long as I did, not the company!"
good,I enjoyed Coram for the short time I was there. I was a file clerk but also did my internship there for billing. Everyone was very supportive and helpful.
good,I was a custmoer service/claim processor. I learned a lot about health industry and insurance benefits. I really enjoyed working with most of coworkers there were so many. Management was ok. The most rewarding part was the customers I worked with. Some were in a position where they needed help and needed someone to act as an advocate on their behalf and it was nice to be able to do that.
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking merchandise, running cash register, assisting in growth opportunities throughout the store and it's employees, meeting daily and weekly sales goals, promoting sales via ad merchandise placement and verbal communication."
good,My job as a pharmacy technician was by far my favorite job ever thus far. I learned so much and have such a passion for helping people and learning about the medications and uses and ordering drugs and making sure everything was in stock and in order.
good,"There are times when company policy is followed but management still badger you about service. They allow their customers to get away with too much and make you look bad. The technicians in the pharmacy are underpaid. The district managers let you know that you are a dime a dozen and that they will fire you if you dont follow the policies, however, when you do follow the policies, you are still disciplined due to the customer ""not being satisfied."" Your job is basically to read the minds of the managers. As far as pharmacy goes, the district managers are strict, and you feel like everyday you go to work, your job is on the line. However, my coworkers are very nice and I have grown some relationships with my customers. You do get the occasional drug addict come in to the pharmacy and start a ruckus, but some customers are very nice and caring, and get to know you by name (without reading the name tag) and remember that you helped them at one time and they grow fond of you. That is the rewarding part."
good,Depending what you're doing it can be fun to work at. But some bosses are not as nice...Photo tech. was a fun part of the job.
good,"CVS is your typical retail pharmacy. It is very busy and very fast paced. The location I was working for was not very organized, however the company as a whole is very good."
good,This particular store compared to other cvs stores in the area had no great structure and recieved many complaints due to the lack of professionalism
good,The managment was very rarely here. There was also alot of temps coming in and out of employment. Would not work with school schedule
good,My team spent there was great in the beginning but was placed in a store with the manager never being there and had 4 weeks of vacation. Thefore i had to be in the store constantly and was salaried never got any overtime or compensation. Torwards the end I had to manage several locations because the other stores were short staff or with out management.
good,Employees were not well equipped to habdle all aspects of customer service.
good,"Pay is never good. Promises are always made that can not be fulfilled. The co workers are amazing and you get to know some pretty cool people. But if you're looking to buy a house or anything,  dont apply here."
good,They never have a schedule out on time. Management is always rude to the employees and customers. They over work you just to under pay you for your work
good,"I was attending school while working here and fortunately for me, my managers were willing to work with my schedule. I was able to attend school full time while working for CVS."
good,Low amount of hours even for full timers. Understaffed with unrealistic expectactions. Payment is really low compared to other employers and banefits are scarce if any at all . Not recommended.
good,The management is the worst part of the company but some try their best to be respectful coworkers and it is a good place for un-experiences persons..
good,"It was great when I worked in FS & Rx, but after becoming certified my hours went to the gutters. The new tech & I haven’t gotten 20+ hrs/week since October. I literally have 5.15 hrs for the upcoming week. I’ve been given inconsistent hours since I started. Barely keeping everything afloat! Coworkers leave without touching trash, vials, paper, RTS, cycle counts or waiting bin!!! FS hates to help RX, unles, which hits our numbers hard af. Mgmt says one thing & does another. A lot of jealousy & envy for no reason."
good,"If you want to have a life with your friends and family outside of work, this is not the place for you. Be prepared to make a lot of plans spontaneously (when the work schedule comes out late), and change these plans just as quickly (when the manager switches your hours without asking, when you get a call insisting you come in). The whole experience is like running on a treadmill: you work up a sweat but never seem to get very far."
good,At this location I found it very difficult to fit in with the current team. The lead technicians took full advantage of their position with them being the only personnel to have a set schedule. It felt as if you didn't get your certificate fast enough you weren't as valuable. Along with all of this the lead technicians were often rude and uncaring towards patients and customers. I did however receive my certification through self training.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with customers and build a relationship based on excellent customer service and learning what each specific customer liked.
good,It was a learning experience to work for the first time. the coworkers where great to be around they have a good attitude towards working at CVS. Its not something i would go back . it was fun tho
good,It got me through school but sometimes the bosses are racist! Be careful with who you work for. I had a few great bosses. Had a few bad ones. Good benefits. People will throw you under the bus to climb up. Be aware
good,"Fast paced environment,   multi-tasking is a must,   the best part of the job is the long time customers, the relationships you form with the customer  and the co-workers."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace environment. I loved meeting new people and providing customer service.  However I was sexually harassed while working here by management and there was never any action taken.  In fact I was forced to work with this person even after reporting him.
good,Worked for this company for 10years and breaks were issues working off the clock  store managers who know nothing about pharmacy having too much opinions  horrible management everywhere
good,"If it's not management or higher, it's the poor compensation that makes it to where one doesn't feel like you want to stay for too long. Management gets you hooked on staying by suckering you into their lofty ambitions and do a poor job of actually making you believe in their cause."
good,CVS is an ok job. The pharmacist are extremely overwhelmed because the company does not want to provide techs.  There is little to no path for advancement as a pharmacist.
good,"i did not like working upper management and lp needs work"
good,"A typical day can go from the store being dead to sudden rushes. You learn a lot ranging from: learning the items, policies, how to handle specific situations, providing excellent customer service, filling the aisles, checking for expiration dates, handling money, etc."
good,This really isn’t a place to set out for a “career change.” It’s a job unless you’re a Pharmacist or you’re one of the lucky ones to get a corporate position. It’s high stress and a lot of work for little pay. The company constantly takes from employees to make up for loss.
good,I did not like it here there was no work/life balance and no recognition for hardwork. After all said and done you are never appreciated for the job done and you have to work long hours.
good,If you’re looking for a PT job it’s spot on. If you want advancement or career experience HARD PASS. It has decent benefits and base pay. Hardly any work life balance and you aren’t trained in depth or detail.
good,"The job is never dull.  There is lots of insight to the mechanics of it all.  Other employees are great. There is so much responsibility and knowledge needed for everything we do, that the pay isnt sufficient.   They expect alot from their employees, but do not compensate for taking on all aspects of the department and sub departments.  You truly are just a number."
good,"CVS has been a good experience for me after enduring nightmarish conditions at my last job. They do seem to at least try to care about their employees, but they're always cutting hours and the management is absolutely inconsiderate about when employees need time off. Don't expect breaks unless you directly state you're going to one. Overall the work is boring, but not too stressful. It's a good job for when you need one."
good,"Cvs is a decent company to learn and take your talents somewhere else , they don’t appreciate the staff who keeps the stores running, the hours a limited so if you can live on 30 hours a week barely making over minimum wage then it’s the place for you"
good,"Very micro managed from supervisors, no praises, little training, unrealistic daily goals to meet, process changes is almost daily.  "
good,This has been the most horrible experience of management I've seen in over 20 years. This should be a well rounded atmosphere with an exceptional team.
good,"Start you off with good training but then over work you, then drop you to 12 hours a week.  Offer dental and vision after 90 days, but have to purchase medical though a 3rd party vendor and new hire is not a life change event and have to wait till open enrollment."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful due to hours being cut in company. Technicians might get paid well hourly but it does not help to work few hours and not have health benefits. You must work 30+ in order to get full benefits. Partial benefits are available if you don't have  30+ hours but you don't make enough to pay for partial benefits."
good,"Great company to learn and gain experience especially while in school, and flexibly with scheduling. If looking for growth and fairness with workload this is not the place."
good,"typical day depends on the position you hold however no matter your position mgmt or cashier you will operate the register to complete transactions, put away stock once the truck is unloaded and sorted if truck day, set the ad on the night before the sale starts. I learned alot of leadership skills and different management skills and various different activities. I also learned that there are opportunities for promotions if you seek them however the program that was in place at the time of my employment was not well executed and led to a lot of frustration and discouragement that never led to the promotion after putting the time in."
good,"Stay away unless you are a pharmacist. CVS wants all management above store managers to be pharmacists. I worked with a lot of great people, but many of those resigned shortly after I did. Most of us planned to retire with CVS but when Target took over, so many great CVS folks left  - especially in upper management - and I'm afraid there was not much loyalty to those of us that stayed. It would really help to be a pharmacist, but the culture has - and still is - changing. It is a lot less team, and a lot more, ""do this or be written up."" Wish I could say better. I used to love working at CVS. I had hoped to stay until retirement, but I went ahead and resigned when Dad needed help at home after an injury."
good,"I worked at CVS for nine years and to me as a company, they are way to big to be offering such terrible health insurance plans. I was not a fan of how the employee's were treated by the company itself not to mention for the fact that they have terrible raise pay. I had a fairly decent boss but his expectations were sometimes way to high, it just came to a point where i had to get out of their. However, as a summer job or just a job to keep a little pocket change I would recommend it. Don't make it into a career tho."
good,Busy and work with big machines. Fast pace. Work weekends. Less people on weekends. Allowed to listen to music while working. Breks and much doesn't change.
good,Lazy workers that seem to get away with doing minimal.  Some people are late every day while others always call out constantly.  The employees that are on the floor should all know where items are.  Mgmt. needs to step up!
good,Everyone was always angry and negative it was really a mood killer. The customers were great though and it was rewarding to help to steps toward their better health.
good,"A typical day at work: High pressure work place. "
good,"Decent place to work, I guess it depends on management. A positive work crew would’ve been a better experience. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers, hardest part of the job was the work life balance."
good,Management was awful. The Store Manager has issues with employees he doesn't like. Makes the job harder than it has to be. He would rather stay in the front of the store nitpicking an employees every action than to Do a manager's job.
good,I learned many things about how health insurance billing works and advanced my customer service skills. The company is growing and adding more brands to it's health portfolio resulting in many opportunities and a lot of work.
good,This job is just that a job the field of healthcare is getting so saturated with pharmacists that no one really takes the time to see if people there are understaffed and over worked.
good,I use to love my job now I dread it. They cut hours to bare minimum and expect you to do 30% more work with less help. It's very stressful and if you say you don't have enough to get ALL the things they want you to get done they basically tell you you cam find another job because thats CVS policy which is an unsafe policy.
good,"What to expect as a cashier: you do pretty much every thing except clean the bathrooms and you're by yourself 80% of the time. "
good,"very easy job, just do to much and get paid very little, been working there for 6+ years as a shift supervisor and make the same as an entry level supervisor...not right at all."
good,"The store I worked at, we were all very family oriented. We loved each other and helped each other. The manager made odd working hours and wasn't keen on doing much other than what he wanted to do. Other than that, it was a good company to work for."
good,Store was nice to work in. However we used to get drunks and shop lifters. That got to be very uncomfortable at times. Dealing with the public was usually enjoyable. On occasion we got to meet popular people. For the most part work was usually enjoyable. Managers were easy to get along with. One manager got his job  from aa friend. He discriminated and conspired against employees who showed brains.
good,"The company seemed to be more focused on making money (i.e. acquiring more businesses, signing new contracts with insurance companies, increasing prices, etc.) versus actually helping it's patients and customers. The staff was over worked, underpaid, and severely unappreciated."
good,Company gave 8 weeks notice of closing due to not renewing lease. Some of the supervisors micro manage and most definately has favortisim amoung their team.
good,"They talk as if you're part of the family, but you quickly learn that you are disposable. They rely on floater pharmacists that often have trouble keeping up with the workload. There is no loyalty and few opportunities to grow."
good,"I would recommend CVS Health but not working for the Grievance Department. Employees are over worked and under valued. Management does not take employee concerns or suggest about the work process into consideration, as it is out dated, and very time consuming, for a position where quotas need to be meet."
good,"Management changed frequently, hours varied from sometimes 30 per week to 70. Mostly friendly, but occasionally fights and several arguments a day. Management did not agree so policies changed frequently. Incredibly stressful environment."
good,"Lack of communication. Disconnect. Work long hours. Constantly understaffed. Hours always cut. Work day shift techs to ground. No evening help"
good,"I started working for CVS  in 1996 and then became 21+ yrs. I was a very loyal employee but unfortunately it was not good enough for them. CVS wasn't flexible with my schedule or when I needed a day off and every time there was a change in management, our store suffered."
good,They were not willing to allow time off even when I had enough vacation hours. The amount of pay was not equal to the demand of the knowledge and skill required.
good,The People are great.....The Management was never there....could never be found......pretty much left on your own......unless they wanted to say something negative about their employees.  No positive coaching---micro managment
good,"you work from a que and you cannot leave until you cleared the que and everything is timed and at the same time you get a 30 min break and barely take your 2 15mins breaks because its so busy, there is no cut off time . co workers call you at home about work. the work place is very toxic, the management there did not even know how to our jobs , could never got to management for help, lack of team work"
good,"Depends on the store you work for. In general, CVS Pharmacy is underpaid, understaffed, overworked, and disorganized. Corporate cuts tech hours to the bare minimum and expect the same output and efficiency. Most stores are fairly flexible with shift hours, the pay isn't terrible all-things-considered, and some teams can make working more fun and bearable. Overall, a decent place to work when your in school but not really worth it if you're in it for the long haul."
good,Expectations are very high and help is very little. There is a lot of work which is left incomplete because of lack of scheduled hours. Sometimes there is only 1 person in the store and no one else to help the customers.
good,"The hardest part of my job is the hours. I have two small children and not being to have the schedule that benefits me time-wise and financially is a little discouraging. If I can't have a ""open"" availability, then my hours get cut. If I work every shift they give me, then I struggle with extended childcare for my children."
good,"a typical work day includes many task such as stocking, merchandising, payroll, inventory, testing, admin, audits, daily walk through etc. the culture varies upon location. the hardest part about working for cvs is there is only two people rubbing the building at a time."
good,Pulling orders correctly and on time not such a problem. Package track breaks down or Totes are not properly staged or available hurts your performance and management could care less. You could be fired.
good,"The job was okay, training was lacking and lousy, very little chance of promotion or pay increase.  Not community feeling.  Learned some new programs that served me later, had occasional overtime which helped with low pay.  Liked having onsite cafe."
good,"While I'm not informed on how it is to work for CVS outside of the IT environment, I can tell you that working there inside of IT is just about terrible."
good,"Stressful work days, micro-managed "
good,"I was a temp to hire for the Pharmacy Dept. The Pharmacy just upgraded to a new system, so the established employees were trying to learn the system as well as teach it to the new employees. The staff was somewhat rude."
good,"It's not the best place to work and always fear a call to HR. It's like being threatened to enter the principals office. Job security does not exist regardless of what you are told. That being said, it can be a fun environment and they do offer training classes, for which you are paid to attend. Benifits are okay, although you have to read the fine prints. The 5% 401k match is pretty good. I guess you have to decide if the stress of working here is worth the paycheck. More often than not it feels like you are being underpaid for the responsibilties you are expected to complete. And there is never enough time! Over the years CVS gas become more about the bottom line and have lost sight of their employee and store needs."
good,"What can I say. This store has various challenges. Sometimes the customer are just ridiculous and I do not understand their sense of entitlement. Management needs to be more structured. However, considering the area this store is doing the best they can, without resources from Corporate."
good,Not enough hours to accomplish all the work that needs to be done each day. Not enough employees to keep the customers happy and satisfied. Not enough time to spend on excellent customer service the way the company wants.
good,"Hours are not comfortable. Pharmacists are under a lot of pressure to"
good,going to work was fun I love my customers. I knew it was time for me to relocate when I started working full time hours but was still labeled as a part time worker so I wasn't getting any vacation time and was written up when I called off of work.
good,"Not always fair to an employee. Different rules for different people. Meet alot of interesting people. Find out alot about the drugs, what their for,how they work. Alot of interesting things."
good,"If you don’t suck up to management your pretty much not liked. Full of favoritism and they talk about other employees to each other. Techs does everything and head pharmacist is very petty, Judgemental , makes unnecessary jokes about other employees and shows a lot of favoritism to his leads employees. Very unprofessional and uncomfortable to work with and to talk to."
good,"Management sucked !"
good,cvs is a very good company if everyone followed the rules there were days I worked 12hours with no break and the pharmacy manager said just take one for the team
good,The switch from Omnicare to a CVS company was not a smooth one with many stressful glitches and lots of uncertainty about procedures and policy changes.
good,"CVS offers great discounts and is very competitive when pricing items. As a consumer, this is a good place to shop for items that are essential. As an employee of this company you will meet quite a few people that frequent the store. Some of which, will be problem customers. Some parents let their children run through the isles and knock over products that were just organized. I have had customers yell at me over a small amount of change because an item was no longer on sale. The upside to this job are the employees. I had the pleasure of working with great people who helped the customers as best they could, cared about the CVS team, and tried to keep the store in top shape for other customers."
good,"Specialty customer care is not aligned with the values of CVS Health. We did not participate in any of the philanthropic, community service, or internal offerings beneficial to employees. Taking time off was very difficult.  The department employs mostly temps, and has a high turnover rate. Management is not interested in an individual's professional development. Daily tasks are repetitive, and do not require any problem solving or critical thinking. Tasks can be compared to a switchboard operator that also assists with patient intake."
good,A typical day of work depends on your team and how many hours tech hours they allow you to schedule. I've had many pharmacy supervisors since I've started and they all work differently. Current management is a micromanager and inflexible. The hardest part of the job is trying to find answers from corporate. It seems like I have to go through multiple people and wait several days to get an answer. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team and getting to know the patients.
good,"My review was based off of personal experience. The job to lifer atio was worrying because every time you turnaround they try to call you in because they have called out. Most likely due to the fact that the pharmacist is stressed frantic and looking to take their rage out on anyone their around which would be their employees. Compensation as mentioned before is absolutely degrading given the workload, certifications and training required. The security of the job is based in the emotions of the pharmacist. The culture depends on the majority of individuals of which you work with and their repertoire with the clients."
good,The culture there has changed over the years and not for the better.It's all about the numbers now not the employee. The PIC is very controlling and micromanages everything.
good,There was no situation where individuality was rewarded. Even the pharmacists where not allowed to make their own decisions when it came to patient care. very short staffed to the point that the store closed at 9 but it was common for  us to have to stay until after midnight to get caught up for the day and then come in 2 hours early the next day to try to keep up.
good,I would rather not answer any questions or give specific feedback pertaining to my employment at CVS Pharmacy. Thank you for your time and concern....
good,"In order to work in the pharmacy, you must be able to work at an extremely fast paced environment. You must be able to multi-task and also be able to not get overwhelmed when patients are yelling at you and belittling you. Just know that the policy is, apologize like everything is your fault because regardless of whose fault it is, it is always your fault."
good,"I liked working there for the most part, it’s a lot of work, so you stay busy. They don’t offer many incentives and lack motivation to keep you interested, it’s barely room to advance"
good,cvs work is very challenging. You can work 10-14 hours without a lunch break. There are many times you work especially as sallaried without getting paid.Example going for meetings for hours without pay
good,CVS cashiers have a challenging job: keeping the customer satisfied and still trying to work on other tasks. I am a people person and thought this job would be perfect. I enjoy my co-workers and love (most) of our customers. Long hours of standing and no breaks or very short breaks have forced me to begin seeking another position.
good,"CVS is very stressful. As pharmacist, we rarely leave on time and the extra hours are not counted although upper management knows that the demanded tasks cannot be achieved within the work time allocated."
good,"The fact that there is bullying and it is horrible to say the least. Any new potential is not supported in the transition to advance. Your given duties and expected to complete without proper explanation, and not enough help. It's not an enjoyable environment to be in. As a company they grade u on the performance and expect to do the most with what your given which is sometimes impossible. Love the fact of helping the customers, but you only can do so much at a time and your burnt out when its not a team effort. Good Luck!"
good,"Started out at minimum wage and after a year only got a $0.10 raise. Walmart employees made more than i do. My pharmacy manager was difficult to work with. After transferring to another store, things got better. I still make a low salary, but am trying to move into a lead tech position."
good,"Would only work here if u really need it, not the first place I would apply to , always on your feet just walking around sometimes it’s really slow management is like whatever’s"
good,Company has potential to be great but currently lack communication  between department. Training is solely on system but on actual work is non existent . Tools and SME are not provided to be efficient and successful.
good,Cvs excepts so much out of their employees. They talk about how to give great customer service. But there are not a lot of people working at one time to be able to execute this.
good,"Needs to adhere to open door policy, work flow, and being focused on the customer. Needs training for pharmacy mangers. Let the tech driven metrics be tech driven not pharmacist driven. Listen to the engagement survey and do something about it. Not just print it on paper."
good,"Its great experience to get your foot in the door but I wouldn't recommend staying here. You're over worked, under paid and short staffed. It's stressful."
good,It was a pretty fast-paced job I always try to get along with everybody and have fun at what I'm doing. The supervisors were pretty strict there but all the employees and key holders they were a lot of fun to work with. I enjoyed the job that I did my biggest thing was that's a customer's that's the store happy with what they purchase
good,"Depends on who are your working with. Most RPH are not bad. Management and corporate don’t care. "
good,"In order to work at the pharamacy in CVS, You defintely have to have thick skin in order to ignore all the rude comments from customers and management. Fast-paced, no room for slow learners or workers. The most enoyable part of the job is the coworkers but the hardest part is not getting tired of the stupid things within the work place"
good,"The company is extremely customer focused, which is both good and bad. You can have good days and you can have bad days, even though its the same service that you're giving. Someone will come in and take their anger out on you."
good,The company acquired us from Aetna and Aetna was a very good company to work for and once everything was said and done we went laid off. The benefits and rewards were good and when we were laid off we were allowed to keep our discounts for life.
good,"Fast paced retail environment , very busy so you're never bore. Some customers can be very demanding. Fun coworkers and ok management. I learned a lot while working here."
good,good place to work not enough pay for the work people were fine to work with place for advancement if your want to work benefits were good with the discounts
good,Very highly skilled people are available to do good work but the internal politics are damaging it all.  The product innovation programs are very high-value.
good,"The Corporate Call Center exposes you to meeting a lot of wonderful people. The work load and interaction with customers could be hectic at times, but once the job is learned it is easy. The hardest part is feeling at times like you can't breathe in between calls. It is a very faced paced job. Sometimes the training classes are very close together where you may not feel you have had an adequate time frame settling in to your new set of skills before they have you train for the next set of skills. The biggest complaint that I hear people verbalize about is their attendance policy and the lack of job work and life balance."
good,Very intense but really good to have on a resume. Most pharmacy jobs require retail experience I learned a lot working at CVS. If you can make it at CVS you can make it anywhere.
good,"I loved working for CVS pharmacy. I learned everything I know so far from CVS. But, in a matter of months we received new pharmacists constantly. Once you learned how one functioned they would replace them. Some pharmacists love their job and like to help you learn... others just truly don't care."
good,"Enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers, my coworkers were very friendly and helpful most times even more than the manager. Also the location you work really matters."
good,"When managed and staffed properly a pharmacy can run like a machine. Not the case with this CVS. It can be very stressful when things are busy and patients are ill, but can be very rewarding when you truly get to help someone."
good,"racist people in the community, no concern for employees' health or issues.  All about the money.  The pharmacy was never staffed well, so the pace was insane, and many of the people hired couldn't handle it, or were poorly trained."
good,Nice ppl work place was nice love to help ppl find what they need do go backs lunch room was small bathroom dirty too many homeless comes in and out  pharmacy  staff was so nice and fast
good,"The Pharmacist was great to work with. He was personable, intelligent, courteous, and willing to assist his technicians when we needed help. Good option if you want to get your foot in the door"
good,Everyday I worked in the pharmacy it was a stressful environment but I enjoyed interacting with the customers and sometimes I got to know the patients personally. The day went by fast and I always need to work in a fast paced to pleased our patients.
good,Job was stressful. Worked extra hours and did not get paid. Supervisor would come and say she is not satisfied because our store numbers are not meeting expectations. It was getting stressful because working long hours and then on top of that was not getting paid extra for staying late to complete all of the tasks.
good,"They will look for  reasons  to let you go when they find some one younger that they will pay less. Heart less people who do not care about their employees,actually do not care about anybody but profit. They compromise peoples health by assigning 3 to 4 peoples job to only one person and expect to get 100% in a limited time."
good,The company acquired us from Aetna and Aetna was a very good company to work for and once everything was said and done we went laid off. The benefits and rewards were good and when we were laid off we were allowed to keep our discounts for life.
good,"Benefits are great but the company refuses to train people. I was making mistakes due to lack of training and rather than train me or give me the tools to teach myself I had job duties taken away and was written up for performance. I was injured on the job and later when I had another episode of joints locking up at work I was called a liar by management. High stress job and never know when you are going to work. Sometimes I know the day before and I have had to work weeks in a row every day just to get 30 hours a week but had to quit my part-time job because my availability was never known quick enough. They keep every store severaly understaffed which creates high stress."
good,"I worked here for 2 years and this entire time I hated the work environment. The staff is always shorthanded the customers are always given priority over the workers. Not a good place to work, I would recommend working at walgreen or wal mart they are much better to their employees than this horrible company."
good,"very stressful job, but if you like the people you work with, it makes a big difference. Its always busy,but the time goes by a lot faster and there is always something to do."
good,I really don't know what to put in this box about this company. The only thing I really like about my job is that I get to be around people and that is about it.
good,"Health Benefits are the pits. It's become a ghetto environment peppered with little to no professionalism. The pay is good for customer service. The company policies, however, are designed with the employees' failure in mind."
good,"cvs doesn't guarentee full time employees 40 hours, so its a good  job if your looking for part tmie even though they may ask you to be full time they never have the budget to provide an adequate amount of hours"
good,"For entry level it is a good office to start in. You will learn the basics of buisness within an office setting, however it is difficult to bid out of the department and grow within the company."
good,"it has been over six years since i worked there, so i dont feel it is fair for me to write a review on this company at this location.what more do i have to write"
good,"A typical day at work was 8 hours standing behind the counter, stocking shelves or dusting displays. Depending on what time of day you worked you got a 15 minute- 45 minute meal break. There was always something management thought you could do better even if you were trying your best. I was called on days requested off to work, and I would get attitude from managers when I said I could not come in."
good,The front end was more desirable than working in the pharmacy. I needed to make up hours I couldn't get in the pharmacy but the on the plus side the front end was more fun.
good,I enjoyed de-escalating upset patients and getting to the root of their needs. The company does not have room for advancement which is why I left. I did not consider it a positive environment.
good,"I learn a lot more than I could have ever imaged by working at this company. It is a very high paced and stressful environment. You have a lot to do during your shift like answer phones, help out customers, fill and take prescription orders, stock the pharmacy, order supply and help teach interns. However, by having this job i learned how to manage my time and about good customer service."
good,Good job if you are starting off in a career in the medical field but not a reliable source for a comfortable living. Hate the management but it depends on the store.
good,"You have pharmacists that sit around all day doing nothing but barking orders and verifying prescriptions. I've been a technician for over 2 years and I'm still making below 11 dollars and i work hard and until my fingers bleed. Everyone i work with is new so I feel like the mother of the pharmacy. I'm the only one who knows how to do production, type in prescriptions, maintain inventory, do PCQ calls, answer customer questions and manage the audits. Just doesn't seem fair for minumum wage"
good,"always short staffed over worked under paid. not enough hours for part time employees.The stock market was good at CVS.To get a raise in pay you would have to become a manager in training for the front of store or Pharmacy Training. You just cant work as a cashier and get a good raise.I loved the work there, i worked in nine stores ordering the American Greeting cards three days a week. CVS has there employees work up the American greeting cards .That is what i was doing.Ordering,stocking,rotating,inventory for nine stores.So i was traveling for hours."
good,"This department is a good place to get your foot in the infusion/prior authorization door, but it is a black hole in terms of internal advancement. There is a high turn over rate for authorization reps, and rarely opened lead/management positions are often filled from outside the company. The hours are difficult, typically 9:30-6, and you can expect a 0.10 cent yearly raise if you are one of the lucky ones, no bonus, no incentive to take initiative with extra responsibilities. The new attendance policy is shameful as well. We are provided the standard PTO to serve as vacation/sick time, but you are given ""incidents"" for every sick call (regardless of Dr note) and every late clock in, with a yearly fall-off."
good,"Leads are not very knowledgable, supervisors are quiet, no room for growth, dead end job, half decent pay, good pto, decent hours, will transfer to different dept with same pay"
good,"I started in a brand new dispensary did the mail order service for patient prescriptions.. I felt there were not enough management. Pharmacists were to hard to reach out too when helping a patient.  Most of the time people were quitting, prescriptions were mailed out late due to lack of schedulers.. I learned many skills there, but unfortunately professionalism and good customer service lacks"
good,"very stressful and no advancement, customers yelling and cursing all the time! upper management don't care about their employees! people calling out all the time! Job its self is stressful gets extremely busy and no 15 min breaks due to the caos"
good,Working at CVS is a great way to build up your customer service experience. They're main goal is to put the customers first and ensure that the customer has a very pleasant experience. Although this is an amazing thing for customers it is very stressful for the crew members when the crew is lead by someone who is not fully qualified for the job of leader. The job became very difficult to do when the circumstances became overwhelming due to the actions of the store manager.
good,There is no respect given to employees who have given many years to the company. Very unappreciated. 20 years of service and all you get is a piece of paper. Not 1 congrats!
good,"Fast pace 24 hr Pharmacy, with high volume of patients,"
good,"Unfortunately the branch I was at had a lack of good management with a lot of over turn.  The job itself was not difficult but the culture was very much 'not my job' so it was more difficult than necessary to do things properly. A lot of people hired on do not do the job properly but rather than being fired or demoted, those people rise to power due to seniority. I was told that I was doing the job better than my manager and two coworkers who had all been there for many years within my first 3 months, however when I asked multiple times about movement or raises in the future, I was met with no opportunities. Ultimately I left the company because of that. This isn't a company that keeps good workers and that says a lot about their culture and management."
good,A typical day at work was very routine and fast paced. The most difficult part was trying to finish multiple tasks in a short amount of time while also working the register.
good,"I am a Pharmacy Technician. The store is always busy there is always plenty of work to be done."
good,CVS would have been a great place to work until they began cutting hours for both technicians and pharmacists. Providing exceptional patient care was compromised due to the tight scheduling.
good,great company if you want to develop your skills as a retail pharmacist. work life balance is not that great but is getting better. opportunities for growth.
good,working at cvs can be good if you are looking for a fast paced environment basically just selecting orders all day and getting them ready for shipment to cvs drug stores
good,"Working at CVS is very tedious and often times very boring. You sometimes end up dealing with picky customers, just like any customer service job. The higher ups in corporate do not care about low level employees and are pretty horrible in the way they treat them. You will probably end up working pretty bad hours and are expected to stay late most of the time. Worker needs are often sacrificed for the customer so don't expect to be let off easy when it comes to complaints, even when it's not your fault. Overall it's a pretty easy job with bad management and bad hours. Starting pay is OK."
good,"Days went by fast. Fun else's that helped the time fly. I leaned"
good,"Great people to work with and a very strong company. Some in management forbid working from home during severe winter weather when employees have full capability to work remotely. Not a very progressive work environment, cubicles are everywhere. Very difficult to cut through red tape and information silos restrict the movement of information."
good,"Managers do not keep good record of your work and when it is time for review they show low score of tickets completed.  Managers are always asking you to do extra work but at the end of the year, they do not reward you, and forget what you have done, even if you remind them."
good,"first thing to is look at the work station board. Greet customers and help service them professionally. Typing, filling and pharmacist verifying prescriptions."
good,Acquired by CVS and as expected as a big company everyone has their own silo and niche. I didn't thrive in an environment so big because of this and the controls that were put in place that more got in the way that actually controlled the environment. More of a rubber stamp environment.
good,"For training they sent me to different stores, was great training for me, when I did get to my home store I felt as if I had to be retrained because that store was not familiar to me, never worked there not even the computers in my home store or pulled medication off the shelf there. as for the staff they expected you just to know how to do it after training, not willing to help, until you stopped and asked could someone help me and then they asked ""did they not train you on this"" my answer would be yes in Tifton or Sylvester.  You were train the right way and some of the other Tech did it a totally different was and my Pharmacist would reassure me that you do it how you were trained to do it.  The store manager was great.  I'm 31 and was the oldest tech the rest was coming because it was a job"
good,Some really great people but confusing work environment due to outdated software. The facility is old and out dated as well. There are not enough bathrooms to accommodate the number of employees.
good,"It was fun to work in the pharmacy setting , but it was so hectic and short staffed all the time. I enjoyed my time working and learning about the new drugs and how different insurance"
good,Its retail. Not really much more to say. The pay is good and the rest you just deal with. Hopefully you can get a decent store with decent  help ......
good,As one of the largest pharmacy providers for elderly rehabilitation and long term care facilities. The company's culture is inclusive and they provide a fair amount of perks for their employees including discounted parking as well as public transit passes.
good,the work environment is always looking for ways to improve your skill sets and with that improve the level of the employees job performance and productivity.
good,"On a daily basis, you would type and fill all prescriptions that drop into QT and QP. There is a daily order that comes, the technician would approve the order, complete QI inventory and put the order away. On a weekly basis there is a supply order generated. The technician would complete the supply order and order depending what the pharmacy needed. During that time, the QT person would watch the drop off window; which means any new prescription coming in, would need to be typed. The QP tech would watch pickup windows, and any time a guest is at the register for pickup their medications the technician would assist. "
good,"work hard for little pay. no room for advancement unless you relocate. hard to take time off because workflow comes before anything here, if there is no coverage they will deny your time off."
good,"I stayed home with my newborn for a couple of years and decided to try something different. I decided to try the Pharmacy field. I enjoy the job itself but the work environment is tense. The Pharmacists do no communicate well and are always yelling at the Pharmacy Techs. The hardest part of the job is meeting the expectations of the Pharmacist, not the job. The Pharmacists seem to have different expectations than the company. And trying to meet both expectations is very difficult. It is important to follow the law but most Pharmacists act like you are interrupting them when you ask questions or ask for a consult. It is very frustrating."
good,The company has become numbers driven from Pharmacy to Store.  Metrics are over ambitious and they really have lost focus on employees. Constant changes.
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking shelves and organizing inventory, checking in vendors such as Coca-Cola, assisting customers locate or carry items, and running the cash register. I was on my feet a lot but customer service and building report with regulars was rewarding."
good,"Considering the increasing number of metrics that they require of their employees, it's no wonder that the company is sliding.  I would prefer to not have to work in that kind of environment, given the choice."
good,I just need something that shows employees that they are they aren't robots and that they want you to grow within the company. I work very hard on a daily basis. And I work long hours thar goes unnoticed. Once I've been a team player and stayed late to help and to make sure my customers ate taking care mt hrs will be cur so that I won't get the ot
good,"Was part of one of the biggest training classes at this company, unfortunately got almost zero training on the computer because there weren't enough to go around. I got on the floor and there was almost zero support. Only 2 people to help over 50 new hires. My supervisor was a power tripping meanie. I only processed 3 applications before being expected to fly solo. Supervisor told me she was too busy to help, tried to find one of the trainers and they were already training another class. They also switched payroll companies and didn't give people the login credentials so they could clock in and out."
good,"CVS is, in my opinion, going down hill. They know they have a really high turn over when it comes to employees and they have just chosen to live with it instead of trying to correct it."
good,"Management was not willing to take the time to cross train. Training class was very general. When released to the real world, we were assigned teams with very specific drug therapies. I became very proficient while on this team and was asked to move to another team to assist, but the verification process was very different and I was expected to know things I has not experienced on the previous team and was not taught in class."
good,"Very chaotic place to work, with not a lot of work/life balance. They will always expect you to choose work no matter the situation."
good,"My typical day at work was very productive form the time you clock in until the time you clock out. Sometimes no breaks because we were so busy. My co workers were awesome, a great team but no matter what we did right we were always slacking somewhere according to management."
good,"I was hired in as Beauty Department Manager. I loved the job, but store managers weren't always supportive. It paid well, but over the years the job eroded down to where hours and staff cuts had me mostly doing stockroom work. The position has since been eliminated since the new CEO did not approve of the manhours put into it. Also, your live isn't with a penny. if there's a hurricane, you better not  miss your shift, if the blizzards cause a driving ban,figure out a way to get there, and if you get a ticket for being on the road, its your problem. Holidays are ruined because of the hours, you are not deserving to be treated like a human being."
good,Very fast pace not time to learn. Must be quick to pick up on computers. Overall very busy place makes time go by faster and is fun with some employees
good,"I was returning to work after a couple of years having been at home"
good,well honestly the company is a greta company to work for by the store manager was horrible to customers and employees. he just didn't make the work environment and good on so I just had to leave cause I couldn't take it anymore.
good,"Employees are expected to do the impossible, and sacrifice their lives for absolute minimal wages possible.  No training, support, encouragement, meetings that take longer than 2 min on job performance, or feedback.  Constantly understaffed, all new Technicians because no attempt is made to retain employees that have experience.  No employee is happy here."
good,"My day at pharmacy can be very challenging but I really enjoy my job specially helping people. I love it when I can make somebody's day."
good,"Work environment was good, client base changed by 2000 customers and no new employees were hired. Also promised raises were not given, ending wage wound up being the same as training wage."
good,management lacks direction...reducing cost is not the best way to keep customers....new ownership = new lower morale.
good,"Nice people and good management, but furthering your skills and position within the company is difficult and tedious. Many people want to be promoted and haven't been for years. As someone who just started I'd be in the queue to get promoted."
good,"i enjoyed working their but it was very stressful.."
good,"It was a decent company to work for, however the opportunities and room for advancement just wasn't there. I would say the hardest part of the job was having to decline requests for prescriptions because the need of the caller or despite the needs of the caller."
good,"Unpleasant place to work"
good,CVS Health is okay if you are salary . Not good for hourly employees. The company need to focus on training and not online training all the time . And need better equipment in there Pharmacys.
good,As a parttime worker I received no benefits. On vacation days I didn't get paid or if I was sick. But my coworkers were great to work with. Work hard and you will be rewarded.
good,"Employees viewed as commodities and not people. Terrible management, and training. Poor communications with employees."
good,Everything was fine until company started making all these changes and thats when everything started to go south and everybody was leaving left and right
good,"my store has undergone a series of change, we have good management in the works now but after taking so many hits the store is still recovering. We are constantly understaffed and busy."
good,"the company is based more as a stepping stone. if you are gearing toward a manager it is a great company, if you are in college and just need cash and a job that is flexible it is great to work here. "
good,CVS needs to concern more with the average workers then management. Their needs to be more incentives non salary workers and more opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"probably don't want to do this if you are fresh out of school, only when there's no other options, no lunch time, compensation if negligible if you factor in quality of life"
good,The amount of work and stress are not worth the paycheck at the technician level. While managers are held to impossibly high standards.
good,Compensation/Benefits is really bad and below standards.  Co-workers were good to work with. Sr. Director was great to work with and easy to support.  I enjoyed getting the department organized and running effect.  Lower treats support staff badly.
good,Never have enough staff to do the work... Company would careless about its employees. A good entry level job but would like something more challenging.
good,There are far to many things this company expects a pharmacist and technician to do at a busy understaffed store. Average 500 scripts with 1 pharmacist is unreasonable especialy when every task is reviewed and scored. Is the workload tough yes but it is made unbearable when every task is graded you start to work for grades not for the people. If you don't make the grades your out doesn't matter if you have thousands of questions from people still have the same tasks in same amount of time. Upper management comes in to review store when maybe they have seen it 3 times in a year and have no idea what its like. Co-workers are good but change so regularly its hard to maintain relationships with them as pay is low.
good,They do not provide training which is fine because it is not hard to figure out what to do. During season they sometimes do not allow 15 minute breaks. Tools required to try and better your work experience are not provided and / ignored.
good,"On feet for 12 hours shift, no lunch no break no time for restroom visit. This giant  company is highly demanding and inhumane, the individuals do not matter.  Will pay good but no respect for seniority.  Will kick you out as soon as the new grads come in willing to do anything.  Always short staffed in Tech help due to poor training and low pay, so the pharmacist has to pull it off under many stressful conditions"
good,"I worked overnights at CVS for a few months after high school. I was offered a little higher than minimum wage which was great considering that I had no prior experience. The overnight shift is usually understaffed, with only two employees working with an occasional third on special occasions. This meant that while cleaning the horrible messes left by the daytime employees and customers, we also had to tend to the cash register as well. The management was atrocious. The overnight supervisor at the time was a complete pushover. He would literally hide in the office despite long lines forming at the cash register early on in the night and in the early morning, and would have to be called on the phone speaker in order to receive help. He also allowed one of the other employees, who worked almost every night, to sleep in the bathroom for two to three hours. The supervisor would also often take longer breaks than allowed to watch WWE VHS tapes he brought from home in the break room. When I requested a holiday off, the supervisor brought this up to the store manager in a negative light and I was yelled at by the manager for doing so. There were many times where the management was more than questionable. My shift was from 10pm to 7:30am in the morning, but many times the store manager would come in the morning and ask me to stay another two hours. Hated working here, and would not recommend anyone to work here under any circumstances."
good,"Busy, Busy, Busy workday. NEVER able to finish anything, barely get to finish medication refills and drop-off prescriptions"
good,"Working at CVS was great at first then became increasingly bad to even terrible at times. The lack of management skills not by my front store manager, but the pharmacy manager and the district manager. They lacked compassion when life's occurrences happen. They also changed the schedule AFTER your prior shift was finished with no update or notice and then punish you because you didn't know. The pay was awful for what my duties were and what I was able to do with my training. I would reconsider this place for re-employment if the management had made great changes and the benefits were better for employees."
good,It was a productive place to work i learned more about customer service. My co-worker were all very nice and welcoming there really wasn't a hard part of the  job but the enjoyable was making relationships with the customers.
good,i am sorry i really have nothing good or bad about the company. maybe its just my store i have a issue with. i have nothing else to say.
good,"The days are demanding, with no room for a family life. Promised the flexibility to continue my charity work along with being an active member of my budding family. I trend to have one day off every 7 days  with the day riddled with phone calls from employer regarding business while off the clock (I am hourly)."
good,"stress all day, poor management, poor working conditions,"
good,"It was busy and didn't leave time to eat except on a short break.  Ate dinner during a fifteen minute break for five years."
good,I learned new things working in a different state. Meet some nice people. They learned new things from me. Was able to do new things
good,"Great company to work for. What the company does not realize is it is hard to do a job at the new DC with no computer, phone and the proper equipment."
good,It's a place where things dont get done or are treated poorly because of personal issues people uphold on individuals. There is no communication at this company
good,The typical work day can be overwhelming at times for employees. People tend to forget that this is a pharmacy and not McDonald's. I personally enjoyed my co-workers/management team. The down side is CVS does not want to give their employees the raises they are worth to keep their employees. While all the newer members start off making more than the older technicians. :(
good,"The pay was fantastic, however the general attitude of the company to the employees could definitely use some work. Bathroom breaks were limited to two breaks a day that could only be 3 minutes long, Unfortunately, because we take so many calls - we are constantly drinking water and thus have to use the restroom more than the average person."
good,the best team I've had the pleasure to work with but not much room for advancement. overall a decent location to work at if you want to enter into the healthcare field.
good,Haven't stressed so much since starting this job. They constantly cut hours and put more work on us. Good for experience but not much else
good,"I am over-worked in the pharmacy and not adequately compensated. Very diverse, however; great opportunity for beginners in pharmacy, like internship."
good,Typical retail type of chain where customers always have the upper hand. Shortage of hours with higher volume of scripts that needed to be filled.
good,The hardest part of the job is not being able to thoroughly care for customers without red tape from insurance companies.
good,"I learned a lot at Cvs and it was quick, but i worked for a couple different stores and it seems like they don't care about their employees. simple request were never met or it would take forever"
good,"My biggest reason for leaving CVS was the lack of truth behind what the pharmacist's would say/promise/tell you to your face.  When something would change affecting what they said to you previously, they wouldn't tell you at all; but instead just let you find out the hard way.  No professional environment should ever be run like that."
good,"This job, although sometimes enjoyable, is 99% of the time a huge pain and added stress that you don't need on top of all the other stress we have in our lives.  You know when someone else says they're a tech at CVS, you know their pain. However being around all the meds helps you learn a lot and understand insurance billing too."
good,Having worked for this company for over 25 years I have seen it grow to a billion dollar business. It has been a leader in the industry. With the movement towards the best pharmacy business. CVS has forgotten the people who have worked so many years to make them great.  The mind set is to move forward with all new employees. Faithful experienced employees are being replaced by younger new hires.
good,A typical day at work was very busy and exciting. I learned more into the medical world with member's prescription plans and what kinds were covered in their health plan. Management was a little all over the place but the ones I worked with were very pleasant to work with and always there when you needed them. My co workers were very helpful and this job had team work written all over it. The hardest part of the job was sometimes keeping up with all the new updates the job had to offer in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the over time hours I was able to receive.
good,"Very busy, you learn a lot about medications, and insurance billing and talking to md's,co-workers are great but the company doesnt give hours need another job even as ft employee"
good,Minute Clinic pays well. It is an easy job since treatment guidelines are spelled out for you. You can only treat certain illnesses. The worst part of MC is the managers they hire especially in the Tallahassee area. Very Poor leadership. NPs seeking employment in this area beware. High turn over of employees. Constant turmoil.
good,"A typical day at work is extremely face paced with something always to be done. We are very team oriented. Without a good team our job would be chaotic. Communication between co-workers is key to make each day run smoothly. Personally knowing our customers and being able to communicate with them makes everyone happy. The hardest part of the day is rush hour, but every smile, thank you and words of appreciation are what keeps us going and helps us enjoy the day."
good,"I actually liked my position and would have stayed but there were some corporate decisions made that required me to work onsite and I had relocated from one to another.  My ""Team"" was located in the other state.  At first I was able to work remote for about 6 months when the decision was made to separate my employment due to the inability to be onsite."
good,I have nothing to say but this company except it is not for me. The hours did not work for my family and I. Given the chance I would work here again.
good,Not a good place if you value homelike lots of overtime absolutely no appreciation for anything you do even when going way above and beyond
good,This company is a nice company if you would like entry level work. There are few options for internal promotion. Other than this is a great work environment with great people
good,"A typical day at work is a fast-paced environment with an extremely diverse customer base, requiring the ability both to multitask and to communicate with a high level of clarity and precision. Management tends to shoulder a heavy workload, and while my co-workers are lovely, sparks can often fly in this type of high pressure environment. The hardest part of this job is probably time management, because things constantly come up, and it becomes every employee's job to prioritize where they need to be when."
good,"Typical Day was filling Rxs, Counseling, Immunizing, and day to day paperwork duties for Inventory Management/loss prevention."
good,"Very modern and clean workplace.  The jobs are call center in nature and you are now basically telemarketers.  Many were hired when they actually got to deal with store based customers and actually felt like they mattered.  Now, all you are is a means to their end.  We didn't help anybody but the bottom line - sad and the exodus is continuing."
good,"I want a change and challenge in a job.  My skills are data entry, training, interviewing, balancing daily, research, and organization skills."
good,"clock in, log in computers, go into the pharmacy to retrieve products to scan. Scan all the items to their destined locations. During downtime process medical returns, clean the warehouse and restock materials. My manager would dictate what we did, and couldn't necessarily take breaks until the scheduled deliveries went out on time. The hardest part of the job was commuting, dealing with unfair treatment, and staying overtime due to lack of proper staff/scheduling. The most enjoyable part was the paycheck."
good,"pay not equal to liability"
good,Typical day was stressful at the store where I worked. Loved CVS and My Pharmacist. Co-workers were not helpful and had their own clique.I really enjoyed being a Cpht and helping my patients. The hardest part was working with only one other technician when your producing over 300 prescriptions per day and not given certain training to make you the best.
good,"This job was good because I was good at it and enjoyed what i had to do and the regular customers were always a pleasure, but sadly there was no appreciation or recognition from the management team or co-workers. Tasks were always given to you either without direction or umpteen amounts of work all left for one person."
good,"Standing all day"
good,"	Inventory management and storage, complete appropriate documentation, such as labels, log sheets and reports "
good,"Overtime available often. "
good,"The company has changed, and I have to decided to move on to greater opportunities.  I need to make more money without working 10 and 12 hour shifts"
good,"Unless someone higher decides to leave that's the only advancement you would have as a tech. They only add .23 every year and no bonuses etc., and you basically do everything. Good coworkers and hours."
good,"great and friendly environment"
good,its a good company to gain experience but no future I call this a stepping stool
good,good place to work. learned a lot and hardest part sometimes is getting correct info from nurses
good,"I loved the challenge I experienced day after day. I never knew what new problem would occur when I walked in the door, whether it was a new insurance problem to a drug interaction that a doctor needed to called on. I genuinely love to multitask and CVS gave me this more than I could have ever asked for. "
good,"Bad place to work, lack of training, conflict of interest among favorites, no compensation for advancement, lack of pay way under the national and state average."
good,"Overall the job was very enjoyable. I loved helping other to feel their best. We worked together as a team to type in prescriptions, pull the medicine, count and fill, and assist the customer at the Pick Up register and Drive Thru window."
good,I worked as a Head Pharmacy tech and work day to day cashier duties and contacted Doctors regular to fill prescriptions
good,"You better get on the right team when you work for this company or you will get nowhere fast!! Watch out for favoritism as well! Once the new CEO took over, things went downhill fast! It used to be a good place to work with good benefits, but little by little the benefits are being stripped from the employees!"
good,Starting from the time you come into to work you are moving and standing. There is only one 30 minute break per 8 hour shift.
good,"there was a high turn over rate where new hires would stay to work for three months at the most. that left having more then enough supervisors and only two at most of cashiers,"
good,"I work with a team of wonderful people. I have had the pleasure of training new employees.  My position requires that I do technicians schedules, ordering of supplies and inventory, and reporting."
good,"my experience was terrible, enough said, sent letter to corporate"
good,"9 hour day"
good,I enjoy talking to my patients and getting them their medications ordered
good,"cvs is a place u can begin to develop ur pharmacy skills and experience, its mostly for young people who in college or live with their parents, people get fired alot for simple stuff, like company gift cards, coupons, etc.. IT IS SO DAMM HARD IN THAT PLACE THAT WORKERS GET TEMPTED TO ACCEPT GIFT CARDS FROM THEIR FRIENDS OR CUSTOMERS THAT KNOW HOW THEY GET LITTLE PAY, OR WORKERS THAT USE EXCESS COUPONS TO SAVE ON THEIR LITTLE BUDGET."
good,"Stocking, facing, and customer service is a typical day of work."
good,"Helps health care providers and patients by greeting them in person and by phone; answering questions and requests; referring inquiries to the pharmacist. Maintains pharmacy inventory by checking pharmaceutical stock to determine inventory level; anticipating needed medications and supplies; placing and expediting orders; verifying receipt; removing outdated drugs. Maintains a safe and clean pharmacy by complying with procedures, rules, and regulations. Protects patients and employees by adhering to infection-control policies and protocols. Organizes medications for pharmacist to dispense by reading medication orders and prescriptions; preparing labels; calculating quantities; assembling intravenous solutions and other pharmaceutical therapies. Maintains records by recording and filing physicians' orders and prescriptions. Generates revenues by calculating, recording, and issuing charges. Ensures medication availability by delivering medications to patients and departments. Prepares reports by collecting and summarizing information. Contributes to team effort by accomplishing related results as needed."
good,I have enjoyed working here but just very pushy on days and low pay
good,hard to manage life and work. always meetings and calls on days off
good,"Not a great place to work. The management never recognizes the hard work of the pharmacists, it is all about the numbers and people does not matter for CVS."
good,patient interaction. typing and filing. stocking and inventory. data input.
good,"Honestly, there is no typical day for desktop support technicians at CVSCaremark.  With over 2,500 associates at 4 locations in Scottsdale, there are only 4 desktop technicians.  You do the math. The day can never be planned - just managed.  The job itself involves mostly 'putting out fires', while managing several problem ticketing systems. "
good,CVS is what you make it! Stand for what you believe in and work your best. 
good,very professional company to work for good pay and good benefit- hard to find a good schedule though
good,"I really did not like to work there, I only did because I was working for Longs when It changed to CVS."
good,"Stocking, working cashier and loading and unloading truck deliveries"
good,A typical day at work is work you butt off they never have enough help they seem to have problems hiring anyone and keeping them.
good,"A typical day as a care rep is to answer phone calls in regards to questions about medication orders, drug plan(s), complaints, etc. The pay and benefits are good. However, my biggest complaint about this company is that they constantly train for new projects and delegate more and more responsibilities on care reps without giving more frequent raises. I did not feel well respected when dealing with extremely irate customers. I saw myself as a whipping post for customers to take out their frustration. Stay away! "
good,"I got good experience working with drugs in pharmacy to prepare me for my career as an RN but this company will work you to the bone. They never admitted to being ""understaffed"" albeit intentionally. They always insited we were ""under trained"" i.e. just didn't work fast enough. Expextations are unrealistic there but that's likely why they are so profitable. "
good,"being treated disrespectful, expectations are too much. i enjoy the type of work, just not the work place. "
good,A revolving door hire 20 ppl in one month and fire many more very unfair pay and hours u can not have a life working for these ppl 
good,"-A typical day at work may include stocking over-stock in the backroom; helping out in the front store (cashier, shop-back and facing)"
good,This is a good company to work for just limited when it comes to career growth.
good,busy days in the pharmacy mainly the focus of the business
good,Work was kind of slow at times
good,Working constantly with the public. Great on the job training. Management is note very flexib;le. Co-workers were great to work with.
good,"lots of customers, phone calls, prescriptions being filled, handling insurance claims, etc. busy busy"
good,"On a typical day at work, I would come in and process returns. After processing returns, if help was needed in packing daily orders I would help pack the orders until caught up, then I would go to order entry, where I entered in orders. My co-workers were typical people. Some were funny and outgoing as to some would rather not be bothered. I liked all of my co-workers and I feel like I got along with them all. The hardest part of my job was going back and forth between jobs and keeping up with everything I had already done and what needed to be prioritized to get everything done in one day. The most enjoyable part of my job was doing so much, because I was able to mingle with everyone, and help which is what helped me to learn something new everyday and get to know everyone in the building. Also being on the fun team was fun because I was able to lighten everyone's day if they just so happen to be in a bad mood and make some days be fun and entertaining."
good,"At CVS Pharmacy, as a Lab Supervisor and Inventory Specialist, I supervise employees by overseeing their work performances and ensuring that all workers are well trained in the basics of working at CVS. I strive to provide the best customer service possible for every customer that comes into the pharmacy and have thus further developed my communication skills. I take orders,and I supervise inventories"
good,"Flexible with family emergencies, Avenue to learn more about intravenous admixtures, TPN's, and compounding. A smooth sailing position when fully staffed, however when not, stress is a key factor daily."
good,"Each day at work there is a steady stream of accounts coming in for us to review insurance. I have learned a lot about diagnosis codes, ICD-9-10 codes, types of drugs, what certain drugs do, How to obtain insurance benefit information and quote accurate billing for a therapy for a patient or referral. The people I work directly with on a daily basis are professional and know how to streamline work in a short period of time. Accuracy and accountability are a must in this business not for our managers and other directors but for the referrals and customers. The hardest part of the job is obtaining benefits within a 45 minute timeframe. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing we are providing quality customer service to patient's and their families."
good,"At Omnicare you have to be ready to shift your schedule at the drop of a dime. I learned to be flexible, deal with people in other states and obtain vital information to complete tasks. Management was constantly changing so it was essential that you just put your head down and work. The hardest part of the job was communication with management. Everything was ASAP, which inherently is impossible. So you need to be prepared to work on multiple tasks at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with everyday. You have to make the best of certain situations and I did my best to make sure we were not only productive, but had fun getting projects completed accurately and on time."
good,"Some of the Pharmacist are great but not all of them, so that's the hardest part of the job."
good,When I started at CVS Caremark it has just been bought out and I was unaware. Through the last two years too many changes and lack of communication has lead me to explore my options. There is too much inconsistency across my department and across the company to feel like I can use my skills to the best of my ability.
good,"There was way too much favoritism there, I liked the work and was eager to learn but was there almost 2 years before they started teaching me anything other than customer pick up. Typical day would be waiting on customers, must of my shift, filling prescriptions. 1 month before i left they taught me how to order, and do returns. There were a few that got a long, but there were several women there, who got the best schedules, and would never move from their station to help when it got crazy busy. The hardest part was just trying to remember eveything, Most enjoyable was meeting new people everyday"
good,Check daily deposits in lockboxes.
good,"The pharmacy world is a busy place. The job is very exciting and enjoyable. My favorite part is the customer interaction. I work with some nice people. I was fresh out of school and had just gotten certified when I got this job. All I knew was what the book said, but know I have lots of personal experiences with different things now."
good,I learned a lot about pharmacy and started working toward a pharmacy technician certificate before I decided to be a stay at home mom.
good,"I have been a pharmacy technician for 4 1/2 years now, and for the past year it has been with cvs. I have always been very fond of my job,until I came to cvs, the management is all over the place,there is no control over their own technician staff, at all. Now not all cvs pharmacies r like this, but I have floated around to many and the majority of them are not friendly,not helpful,and everyone is seemingly out for themselves."
good,"Fast-paced environment requiring strong skills in time management and multi-tasking, assisting customers, recoding, filing, and dispensing medications per physican orders, answering phones, researching drug information and interactions. During my time at this job, I learned that the opportunity for advancement was essentially non-existant and employees were not recognized for achieving goals and giving extra effort. Additionally, many pharmacists and management personel disregard patient privact and violate their HIPPA rights. It was difficult to personally interact with co-workers due to the fast-pace environment, and the fact that the business was customer-centered. The hardest part of the job was the physical demands (standing for 8 or more hours), being denied rightful breaks due to busy schedule, and knowing that the opportunity for advancement was slim to none. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help patients and interact with diverse populations."
good,"a typical day at work for me is really busy, because of the company being short staffed, although it gets really busy i have learned alot working for this company (filling scripts, counting mediications, alot faster in typing and just working on a pc). my managers are really nice and are for the employees, and my coworkers are sometimes lazy but very friendly."
good,"This pharmaceutical benefit management company was a wonderful place to polish my customer service skills. As a Customer Service Representative I answered in-bound calls, resolving client issues about the various facets of their individual pharmacy benefits."
good,Work was okay co works were alright. This company is not the best just okay. They do provide a service.
good,"One of the pharmacist was really judgemental, and if you didn't live to her standards then she gave you all the bad hours."
good,"A typical day at work for pharmacist (full time staff or pharmacy manager) - opening duties; logging on to the company intranet to check emails, check workload manager links, Store Own Sales links, to complete pharmacy operations tasks - identifying drug recalls, or inventory managment reminders, identifying prescriber contact opportunities for generic drug substitution; constantly checking the variety of QUE screens: QE (edits and exceptions); QA/QV (quality assurance and pharmacist verification screens); QR (new electronic scripts that drop in anywhere from 1 script to 25+ scripts that have to be processed in data entry for production/filling, then ultimately being checked by the pharmacist before dispensing; fielding patient's questions via phone and walk-in at the pick-up station/drop-off and drive thru stations; taking doctor and nurse calls for prescriptions off the voicemail every hour; ringing up customers at the register; helping them with various OTC medication selection, sometimes even doing personal shopping if they are handi-capped or elderly and require assistance; calling language interpretor line for the non-english speaking patients (often Spanish or Russian in my demographic); inventory duties: daily cycle-counts of shelves; removal of overstocked/high cost drugs and processing them for return to distributor warehouse or outside vendor for credit; monitoring drug loss or minimzing prescription sales loss; transferring medications (IN and OUT) from competitior retail pharmacies; processing damaged or expired drugs for return to warehouse; and so forth and so"
good,"Once clocked in, begin preparing TPN or antibiotics if availble. Learn of Learning central or CE's that need to be completed or a patient that has been admissioned into our services that needs an item right away. Management not addressing conflicts directly among the staff is often frustrating, especially if addressed multiple times with continuous incidents is often the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is knowing that I am helping a sick patient and hopefully, saving their lives because of my dedication and committment to what I do."
good,"I was there to assist pharmacist, take in new prescriptions, enter them into the system, inventory, point of sale, phone calls, scheduling and training. Written out of schedule because of hiring from outside of the company and split responsibilities."
good,"Management doesn't say ""no"" to incoming work; unplanned and unbudgeted work is universally accepted. The litmus test for me is that we do not go into Major Code releases in a ""green"" status. For more than four cycles (8 months) we've gone into Code Release ""yellow"" - to me this means our quality and priorities are not in order. People are expected to work multiple projects and some developers are working 65+ hours per week. This is the norm, not the exception."
good,"I believe CVS is a great company, The pay/ raises are horrible."
good,"- Good place to work ."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.  The management team was an OK team to work for.  The pharmacy was an enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I worked at a couple different locations during the 4 years I was with CVS. For whatever the reason, in my first store (in Tewksbury), I really clicked well with my colleagues (both Pharmacists, Technicians, and Other Interns). This made those really stressful busy days bearable, and other days productive and fulfilling. Despite the insane amount of phone calls that needed to be completed/answered or the extra shifts I picked up, I really felt valued as an important member within the team and even overall within CVS/Health itself."
good,Walking into Target in witch this CVS was placed we would have a line formed before the door are open and a line after closing it was a busy store. I learned people on medicare are the most important people they need everything done fast and now. Management was allover with different picks a few of them were good but some were not. the hardest part of the job was the customers they were very not nice in good words. The most enjoyable part was going home every day.
good,"Over the years, the company has become more focused on profits, metrics, and shareholders.  The customers and employees are not  priorities.  Employee morale is extremely low.  Many top notch associates tend to leave because they feel unvalued.  Job is demanding and highly stressful."
good,"CVS corporate management prioritizes short-term shareholder profits over long-term sustainability, employee happiness, and patient satisfaction. If you work for CVS, expect to be under-staffed at all times and be expected to get more done in fewer and fewer hours as time passes."
good,"A typical day of work at CVS means bringing your best work ethic. From being able to identify items and read labels and instructions, to being able to lift heavy merchandise, CVS provided me with a number of challenges."
good,CVS is a great company to work if they paid more money. They do not compensate their employees any holidays bonus and yearly pay increase are never more than $0.24
good,"Management was not always understanding with the health problems I had. It would upset me that they would think I made excuses not to go into work, but in reality my past health problems would not allow me to."
good,"This job has a high turn around rate and they are continuously hiring at the end of each year to prepare for the busiest part of the season which is Welcome Season (the beginning of each year). "
good,"I worked at CVS and at first at the orientation I liked what I heard, when I actually got into the job itself I started disliking it. Was told a start time and end time and come to find out that wasn't even true. No one can leave until the goal is met even if its nearing the end of your shift, you're forced to stay into overtime until goal is met"
good,"Leadership is unfair and shows a great deal of favoritism. They have pre-selected those they choose to groom even if you work your butt off, meet all qualifications, meet all goals, or should I say even if you exceed all goals."
good,"Terrible location"
good,Store payrolls are so low with the expectations that managers will work 7!days a week 70 hours a week. Weekly deliveries are packed with no care for the safety of associates. Upper management only cares about themselves and do not support store managers
good,"It’s a good place to start. Not at all worth it if you’re a Sr. Level manager. You still have to start from the bottom and attempt to move your way through. There’s not much support or tools you can utilize for training purposes to be able to move up. It’s all “modules”.  If you’re accustomed to a fast-paced environment, then it’s not for you. There’s also not much room for growth."
good,"You have both your manager and district manager breathing down your neck to hit certain metrics that are unobtainable. Continuously cutting hours left and right so that that CEO can continue making 24 million dollars a year. But then, while cutting hours they still require you to hit metrics with no people there to hit metrics."
good,You typical struggle without enough scheduled employees and then all the customers scream at you and cuss you for not having it ready or gotten yet from the doctor.
good,I had to work at a location that had not just one but two train tracks.   Customers are trying to converse with me and I cant hear a word.  I guess what is being conversed with me isnt important.
good,"I have worked for CVS for a little over 3 years. They are constantly busy from time of opening til closing, corporate is constantly telling you to be in meetings, updating systems, modules as well. All while your doing your day to day tasks. ""No rest for the wicked""."
good,"Work duties have increased while hours have been reduced making it difficult to complete daily tasks."
good,If you get a good supervisor you’ll have a good experience. If you get a bad one you have no chance for improvement. Work environment of find someone to blame.
good,"Busy days and slow at nights after the pharmacy section closes. The managers are friendly, colleagues play a lot of politics for personal gains. Prices are slightly high but coupons help."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of Customer Service, Product Sales, And a variety of Inventory Count Procedures and Changing Sales Tags. "
good,"1) Long hour days."
good,another bad work experience I cant explain..alot of employees lied and blamed others ..often..it was a lot of hostile talk with the  employees in the pharmacy.. very competitive and clicky..They would gang up on new employees until they quit ? ;(
good,Not pleased with this position. Management did not show authority in their position. There was no organization in the pharmacy. The pharmacist was not helpful at all!
good,"I would like to be able to have more opportunity to perform my duties as  a pharmacist interacting and supporting patients on their path to better health."
good,"There is no such thing as a life/ work balance.  They give you the ability to request time off but, complain when you do."
good,CVS has great benefits. I love jumping from store to store helping when it's available. Some management roles should have been taken on by more experienced people. It's all about the customer notbre employee.
good,Typical day at work-corporate dictates it’s goals to retail-retail employees try their hardest to accomplish tasks with the decreased hours corporate gives all departments
good,a job that I liked but changes make untenable Management  want u to do 3 jobs for the price of one and cut hours so that u can barely make a living  and  job is very mentally and emotionally draining.
good,great opportunity to internship for the company. Paid training provided for those looking to gain experience and learn the ropes of the Pharmacy department.
good,"Pay is very low compared to other like companies. No time for breaks, only lunches. Too much work for the allotted time and lacks good management. In fighting a real problem. Too many backstabbers"
good,"In some way CVS health can be helpful as far as learning. As far as management, staffing, and organization there are some changes that should be made, that may be able to help them in the long run."
good,"Responsible for processing prescriptions, following HIPAA and approaching patients about healthcare and insurance information. Communicate with patients, insurance companies and Physicians to explain co-payments, alternative solutions for patients to receive lower prescription costs and engage in prior authorization requests. Maintaining the store’s drug inventory by keeping track of items that are in stock and out of stock."
good,"As store manager it was required that store manager worked two closing shifts per week."
good,its a very fast-paced work environment. Ive learned a lot over a short time of working there. the hardest part is trying to keep up sometimes but the most enjoyable is knowing you made a difference in someones life
good,When i started working I started with the 2 BEST pharmacist you could ask for. No both of them are not there and the ones that took over treat you like a robot. They expect more than the available time. plus now after doing all i can for them working well past my availability and now they cut my hours.
good,"If you weren't in management, nothing you seemed to say mattered to corporate. When there were problems with favoritism and discrimination, not to mention pure pettiness, with the manager, nobody did anything about it since it was Management's word vs yours and they always won."
good,No talking to your peers or other departments. Upper Management not interested in the employees' input or ideas. Ridiculous production requirements with inadequate tools to get the job done.
good,Management for this company is one of the worst I have ever worked for and I mean upper level management above store managers. They promote the if a customer complains enough just give them what they want mentality. Also very hard to move or even get a decent raise for that matter. Its a good short term job not long term.
good,"Investigating health insurance grievances. If you like solving cases then its good work and satisfying even easy. But there is a catch and that is the work plan based on incoming case volume. Shocking to learn, but lots of people file complaints about prescription drug insurance. When the overall work in progress is high expect you to be called to work lots of overtime. It is a salary role so you are exempt for additional pay. But if you don't meet your work plan beware! I start looking for internal and external opportunities after 1 year. The first six months was an easy challenge and satisfying if not an easy job. The second 6 months once enrollment period start has been a flood of work. In that time I have worked at 20%-30% increase every week which amounts to 50-60 hour work weeks. Case complexity can be vary which effects how long it takes to get a case done but expect a lot of work. Also, you will be require to make a call to the beneficiary to address the case. Those can go bad, but they can be easy."
good,"This job as a whole was an easy job, however as of right now it could use many improvements. The location that I work, managers are overworked with no motivation to work. A lot of things can be approved to this company."
good,"On an average day I cashier, stock the shelves, do price changes, take inventory, order inventory, count drawers, and close the store.  "
good,"I would be the cashier, attend all customers. If they needed help finding anything we would have to know where everything is at the store. Then we would stock up on our free time and make sure the store looks presentable."
good,"they have flexible schedules but they dont want to pay their employees and it can be very unorganized and not a lot of stuff is promised go through, i just feel the company is all for their self"
good,"The training courses are the only real education you get. The rest of pretty much everything else I knew, I taught myself, and I excelled beyond most of the others and had to teach them, some being my superiors. When promised a raise or wage, make sure to stay on top of it because it took me 7 months to get mine."
good,"I'm currently a supervisor as of 4/23/19 working at CVS in MA. I've been here for 4 years and have watched the company change from a ""customer satisfaction"" motto to more a number significate store, as far as ratings. They are progressive and do work on self-improving however I feel like that's only pushed on a ground level. Being at the ground level I'm not able to see the rest of the pyramid but they heavily and continuously force extra work onto a store without disclosing what it is the people at the top are doing, the ways they're self-improving or being more understanding as far as us being human and not robots. we require sick days, some of us are parents or older people that easily get hurt. things come up all the time which they do understand. They do offer myleave which is unpaid time off but as far as any paid vacations, maternity leave, workers comp, etc you will have to be full time to receive those benefits. If you're part-time they will give you the time off but u will have to make sure you have enough saved money to last. Our store was one that had hours cut so more work + fewer hours = stress and build up of task. Regarding the work itself, they give you a task and leave you to finish it however way u choose to. You won't have someone on your back to have things done a certain way as long as it meets the standard. The tasks are all doable and if you don't understand there are many people and resources you can go to for help. There are also lots of opportunities to move up. As a part-timer, they do not drug test however for higher positions and pharmacy they will."
good,"You can't take a day off for the first 90 days of employment, and if you call out sick you get a point. Even if you come into work and are sick and have to leave you get a half point. 10 points are allowed, the 11th could get you fired. Not a great place to work. And the pay isn't the best either."
good,"This place is all about taking the calls. They say our job is to make sure patients receive their medication (which involve a lot more than answering calls, we need to call out to doctor's offices, insurance comapnies, email pharmacist, billing. leadership), but whenever we are more than 15 minutes without answering a call leadership start asking what you are doing. They monitor employees at all times, they say we are not supposed to speak with other coworkers outside of break time, but leaders (higher positions) can chat non-work related matter with each other and that is no problem. They make you do a ton of mandatory overtime (they did mandatory 10 extra hours per week for 4 weeks in a row). It was pretty much impossible to have a personal life after work because we were just exhausted ad mentally"
good,Don't plan on staying the rest of your life in CVS. Depending on where you work at is great but some of these corporate people have absolutely no idea what theyre talking about. Sometimes we have questions to ask them in the Pharmacy and in the Front Store and sometimes they dont know how to answer it. This place is based off of numbers and eventually youll become one to.
good,"The place was dirty. The management didn't care about the employee's, and the training was awful. I was lost on the job the majority of the time, and the treated me as if I was below them."
good,"This job is an incredible opportunity to learn all that you can about retail pharmacy. I learned everything I know from my 2 years at CVS Pharmacy, and I learned a lot that is not taught in a classroom setting. Great option for pharmacy students or pre-pharmacy majors."
good,"I've worked for the company for almost 13 years now. The company helped me grow overall however they didn't follow through with their promise. I asked to be transferred to a location closer to my house 7 years ago and it never happened. I've been commuting to work almost 50 miles one way every day from my home for past 8 years. As we all know this is a huge chain with a CVS at every corner and it's such a shame that they neglected a dedicated employee by not honoring a simple request of transferring locations to one closer to home so that I wouldn't have to make the 1 and 1/2 hour  commute to work every morning. "
good,"You will be struggling to do multiple tasks at once with no technician help given they significantly decreased hours over the last year. You will sometimes (depending on the store) be so busy you won't have time to eat anything while standing on your feet for most part of the day. Complaining to management won't help because all they want is to see your numbers increase, as with any other retail chain."
good,It was a good environment as far as the people I worked with. There were not enough hours so we were constantly stressed out and running ourselves rabid.
good,"Everyone has the coworker that they don't get along with but that became a big issue when it became a coworker and my boss. management changed, employees were switched between stores, hours were cut. everything became very stressful and difficult to enjoy working in such an environment."
good,When I was there there was a change in the computer operating system and everyone had to relearn there job all over again.  There was a lot of turn over and the new system was not easy to learn.  I lot of information did not transfer over to the new system and it had to br recaptured.
good,"I left because they only gave me a .20 raise the entire time I was there (a little under 2 years). My hours were set from 4pm to midnight but I only worked 3 days a week unless I was called in to cover someone who was sick and my days off/days working were never set. The only people on a shift are one cashier and one manager. "
good,"CVS is becoming a big company.  There is some job security in that.  The branch allow work from home which is a big positive.  "
good,"Upper management is stressed and chews out middle management, who gets stressed and chews out in-store management and employees. Have had several different bosses since I started and saw a lot of management and tech turnover. Was mislead about my compensation and about a promotion."
good,"Very fast-paced, able to work autonomously but communication was organized. Customer service was a very important part of this position. Some days just flew by while others felt like they would never end."
good,Long lines for pick up and long lines for drop off. To many costumers not enough employees. They don't ever want to pay there employees what they deserve or treat them how they should be treated.
good,"I have worked for the company for 4 years, and I would not recommend working here. They cut hours, so full time employees only get between 30-34 hours per week. We are short staffed because of it, which puts everyone under alot of pressure, and make us stressed out, and keeps us constantly behind.Customers are having to wait longer, and its because they don't allow us to have that many people working, we simply can't do everything. Corporate does not care, they keep barking at us about our numbers, but do nothing to fix it."
good,Every patient brought on a new interaction. Every person is different and as well every interaction is different. Good place to test general customer service skills.
good,I don't feel comfortable working alone. You can't talk with your colleagues because there is no time to do it or because you are the only one at the register
good,"Work life balance, work life balance, work life balance!!! This is a challenge to say the least, I think the company could do so much more if they respected their employees more.."
good,"Loved helping the customers, but the environment was a little noisy. There was little to no chance of management opportunities if you have not had any tenor with the company."
good,Very busy fast paced of work customer svc inventory and rx input you work more with the elders do deliver the hardest part was trying to keep the customer happy some can be happy some just mean
good,"I love being  a pharmacy tech. I also loved the team that I worked with but the only reason I stayed with Cvs was because of my own manager of my team. They seem more worried about profits than guests or employees happiness. They constantly cut tech hours as well as pharmacist hours, while the workload increased."
good,My department was extremely strict with little flexibility.  This is not the case with all departments.  There was a good deal of favoritism in my department.
good,So so place to work for.  People and co workers are good.  Sr. Management Is out of touch with the day to day activities of what  a person does.  Work life balance is non existent.
good,"I have to work every weekend."
good,CVS provides opportunity to many first time employees to start their career.  The leadership and mentoring was weak but if you are a self starter you can thrive.
good,"a typical day at work is pretty dull"
good,"It's very busy, very chaotic. While they do have room for promotion and growth, they do no have enough hours to give to the techs. So it will basically be 1 tech who gets full time and the rest of the tech have to divide whatever hours are left, which basically leaves one tech with 20hrs, 1 with 18, 1 with 15, and the other with 8.. WHO CAN LIVE LIKE THIS? The pay is not good at all."
good,"they help me develop some skill. i was not an employee so my experience is not the same as a regular workers would be, im sure."
good,Was very positive prior to org change.  Since then all three managers in the impacted org are gone.  Varying groups would get quite different reviews.
good,At first the cashier at the front job seemed to be a good job. It was quickly outweighed by the tense atmosphere. It may have been the particular store I worked at with particular employees but it became a stressful job. The store manager couldn't seem to keep up with everything and it had a trickling down effect. With not being able to keep up with things the other employees fell short on their jobs. Below store manager the shifts wouldn't do what needed to be done which caused stress all the way around. Too much was expected of me as a cashier which I later found out I was doing more than I should have been doing.
good,"- A typical day includes being in at least 3 places at once, and knowing you have a list of accomplishments you will never be able to achieve."
good,"I worked here while in school, the hours were very limited and seems like there was competition for hours at times . Which isn’t good, people would say bad things about you to get your shifts..."
good,Work environment is ok mostly busy. Can be stressful due to the amount of work there is and the amount of staffing we have. The staffing is not equivalent to the amount of work most of the time.
good,I loved the Pharmacists I worked for but besides that it is a giant monopoly to work for with absolutely no care for their employees. You're expected to have the knowledge base day 1 and are worked like a dog.
good,The company was always half staffed because of budget cuts. A typical shift that should include six techs often consist of three techs. Overworked and highly stressful.
good,I learned through my experience at CVS as a pharmacy technician that working at a retail pharmacy was not an option for me as the environment left too much for one person to learn on the fly  rather than though thorough preparation.
good,"CVS is great place for a pharmacists assuming you can handle the fast pace and stressful environments. With that said, the drive to cut cost and reduce tech hours have really made the job harder and more stressful than usual. It tries to utilize all the skills a pharmacists can offer, but metrics make it so difficult to for pharmacists to do this."
good,Cvs wasn't the place for me I wasn't comfortable working there and the managers weren't nice at all and just sneaky and very two faced people and just not good at all.
good,Cvs was good at make sure that you got paid for any training classes that were required. Management at the store that I was in was not very professional.
good,"I was only there for a 6 month contract. 2 months in, I found out I needed to have lower back surgery from a MVA. They allowed me to work from home for 3 months but when I got back I was not fully recovered. We mutually agreed to part ways until I was able to work FT again. Very stressful environment with the phones ringing constantly in addition to very LOW pay"
good,"Extremely fast-paced so, you have to think quickly and move quickly. The pharmacists also have to carve out time for lunch, as lunch breaks are not scheduled."
good,Caremark has good PTO. Benfits are okay. Management isn't always professional. As long as you do your work you will be fine. Not much availability to advance but you are able to move around.
good,"With this position you find your self learning about different management aspects. You train  and develop different position levels."
good,"Although you work with many different programs/systems (Oracle, HPSM,Citrix) , it is a call center. Non stop calls (depending on your level of experience), metrics have to be met and everything you do is logged/criticized down to how long you use the bathroom."
good,"Just typical grunt work with high amount of regulations and procedures. Pay is ok but not for those looking to pursue after college. It's good for to learn some customer service, humility, and some work ethic."
good,"Monday is the busiest day. CVS is a very fast pace job, employees are timed on how fast they can get the medicine out. The customers are very aggressive if the medicine is not ready. the thing I enjoyed most about this job is when there was a steady flow and we had coverage ( enough people to get the work done) sometimes we were short stave which made the job very stressful because, then its only one or two people doing multiple jobs while customers come to drop off prescriptions and pick them up."
good,"They put you through a rigorous training course. In a few months I was certified. I learned how to type and fill prescriptions. I learned which medications were used for which ailments. Overall, it was a fast paced and constantly changing environment."
good,"Nice place to work, enjoyable people. lots of things to do, variety. something new each day. learning experience, Pharmacy good spot to help in, stocking shelves etc"
good,"no one was held accountable at my store. management was horrible, there was definitely favoritism and not a fair schedule. The days were long from the hours of 12-8 and sometime last even longer."
good,"Company is focused more on meeting metrics and quotas.  Doing more work with less employees - leading to job burnout for many employees. "
good,Management at the store I was working at wasn't the best and didn't seem to care about pharmacy employees. Some days we didn't have enough help. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers. It was fast paced most days and you had to be able to multi-task.
good,"CVS is great for someone who recently graduated high school with no job experience, education, families or responsibilities. You have to be available to work all hours, cover shifts for the numerous call ins, stand on your feet for hours, and get yelled at by adults who act like lost children. The compensation is reasonable if you don't have a family to take care of. Management changes frequently so if you don't get along well with one pharmacist just wait a month or two and you will have a new one."
good,"To much micromanagement for adults . Unhealthy atmosphere and no formal training of job.  They ask for input but nothing changes. Not much advancement for those who qualify.  "
good,Retail is retail. I loved my Pharmacists but did not make enough money. At all. Some of the way they handle things is unorganized. Don't work here....
good,The goal at CVS is to provide excellent customer service to all customers. At the front end we are rated by regular CVS card customers. However they rate on a scale of 1 to 5 and if we don't get a 5 then it means nothing and we are penalized if it is regular occurrence. We are asked to do a multiple amount of tasks and are highly regulated through modules and training. However we are given very little payroll hours and staff that is part-time is not motivated to help with those tasks. Managers are usually the ones working on those tasks and are usually called to help with line since there is minimal staff. There are multiple opportunities to be written up and little to no recognition.
good,"Fill prescriptions all day and handle insurance issues all day in a "
good,At caremark its all about numbers to the company and they dot tend to show appreciation for employees. Seems those who don't work hard can get away with almost anything but those that do make one mistake and are written up. Pay is okay if you're single and or a student but not worth the poor management and environment
good,"Too much turnover, not enough training,payroll hours led to a lot of stress and negativity in this store. may have just been the store though. other stores seemed to be much better"
good,The store I was at was poorly managed and the area has a lot of homeless and theft. My manager played favorites with hours and shifts. Employees didn't work well together. No team work.
good,"Personally, I do not enjoy working here. I don't think it is being run in the best way. The people I work with are not friendly and there is pretty much no room to grow and advance."
good,Omincares poor management leads to numerous layoffs. Ive seen great employees leave without any good reason.  The jealousy between female management and its female employees is beyond ridiculous. They walk around watching everyone instead of fixing situations that need much greater attention.  Sad part is that when you try to input new ideas or suggestions they are unwilling to hear you out or ignore you. Just know that they can let you go at any given moment.
good,Show appreciation to your techs. Place them where they are best at not based off where they want to be in the production line. Listen to the advice given.
good,"Work is stressful during the morning, lunch, and rush hour. If you are not quick enough to handle situations quickly and effectively then your store will get a bad reputation from customers."
good,"This job is usually pretty stressful but it depends on the store you're working at. There are going to be pops of insane busy-ness and low drops, but there's always something to do in a pharmacy. I really enjoyed being able to help and see customers and make sure they are taken care of, even if there are some customers who are not so nice. You need to have a tough skin to work here. You WILL get smack from customers, no matter where you're at. The management is awful and the benefits are decent, but good luck getting them. Both times I've worked at CVS, it took me almost a year to receive insurance since there's only 1 annual enrollment period, so if you get hired right after that period, you have to wait a whole year to get insurance, and you only get it if you are listed as a full time employee in their system. Usually they will try to con you out of insurance by hiring as part time to start with, even if you are working full time hours. Paid vacation days stack up but slowly, no paid time off, absolutely NO overtime, and has a very strict absence policy. All in all, it's not a great company to work for, but it depends on your coworkers. They will either make or break this job."
good,"We are hardly allowed to make any mistakes per year (ex. QA defects)."
good,"I have been with this company for about 9 months. We started with 30 people who trained in our class and started on the phones we are down to 7. They have PTO but you are unable to take it because of the mandatory overtime, which is nice in the beginning until you realize that all you are doing is working. Management will pick you apart if you make any errors which kills the moral of the team causing people to quit."
good,"Cvs has many locations and positions for possible growth"
good,"The job itself is not terrible,  The main thing for me was the lack of workers. One person was expected to do everything: Stock, put up tags, photo station, help customer, check out customers. It just became extremely overwhelming at times."
good,"The IT department was plagued by a culture of fear for the past few years.  It's gotten much better since the previous CIO ""left"" at the end of 2017, but it still is not the best.  If you follow the rules and do your job you'll be fine, but there is still a culture of placing blame rather than really determining a legitimate root cause.  Much of that is residual from the previous CIO and the VPs that he put into place.  The culture is beginning to change for the better, but it's going to take awhile to undo all the past harm that was done."
good,I was a LP in Las Vegas for cvs.in 5 years i got a $1 raise.they never give raises nor offer much advancement. They laid us off and offered no other positions when we applied.
good,"The people are good for the most part, but one weakness and you're stressed all day. Understaffed normally because we are a smaller store. They don't want to give you full time status because I believe they do not want to pay benefits. It is retail pharmacy so there is face to face customer service consistently and it is difficult to get work done. Best part of the job is the connections to certain patients and your team. Other than that nothing is keeping me there. Do not get paid enough or benefits."
good,"CVSPharmacy has a great entry level Pharmacy Technician opportunities. However, sometimes I found the working environment extremely stress mainly due to the work load and the lack of time for seasoned employee to train and give good quality time to new technicians. And in my opinion, I think we were understaffed."
good,Leadership ideals are filtered through middle management -  OK benefits - good work life balance - mediocre training - good people to work with - serious about employee health
good,"CVS was a good learning experience for me. It was, however, a stressful and labor intensive job. It is nice because it is fast-paced and rarely is there a dull moment, but it can also be very stressful"
good,"More and more companies and organisations are realising that improving employee performance and creative thinking is not just about cracking the whip to make people work harder, for a little more pay.  In fact, in some circumstances it can be counter-productive. One quick and fairly inexpensive method to improve outputs is to improve employee conditions with the introduction of a game table(s).  What, I hear you say?  Let employees play games during work hours?  Yes and there are a number of really compelling reasons why games tables in the work place can improve employee creative thinking and employee performance but in the case of CVS Company  none of that matters to the compay"
good,"I think there is direction there to follow; however the current recruitment process is severely broken. Maintaining over 400,000 prescriptions monthly while understaffed more than 20 pharmacy technicians is draining on their remaining staff. "
good,"Put stickers on everything every week. when all your work is done keep walking around and working anyway. Only staff the store with two people unless its a special day or something. meaning you cant just be at the front waiting for customers you have to walk around and straighten and keep checking every ten seconds to make sure someone is not waiting. I worked the pharmacy for a bit and the staff would stright up get mad at me for things out of my control. did a bunch of online modules shortly before I was about to leave and so they refused to pay me for those modules. when I moved to pharmacy they promised to up my pay. two months later and they never did it. Not the worst job, but far from a good one."
good,Every store is different. Must be able to answer phone calls while counting prescriptions. The hardest part of the job is not being appreciated and being yelled at by multiple customers a day for simply doing your job. It is a very stressful job every day that you're at work.. at least the busier stores.
good,Work way to hard for little pay. Plus they terminated me out the system once I went back to work because I didn’t turn in leaves of absent form!! BUT I WAS ALREADY BACK AT WORK...plus they shorted my check and it took months to finally get it.
good,It was a good place to work if you like doing all the work while the RPH just bark orders at you. The pay is not good at all with what you have to put up with.
good,"The ongoing joke is that everything at CVS is done the ""CVS Way"", which means the most unproductive way corporate could come up with.The employee ""help desk"" is referred to as the ""helpless desk""."
good,"Overall the CVS Health is a okay place of employment, but redline caps on wages and unrealistic demands from middle management in order to secure their annual bonus are a huge problem."
good,"you are basically doing the same job as the pharmacist except with the last verification step of the right medication  for the right patients and their needs. other than that expect to be filling prescriptions, talking to insurance, cashier, stocking, completing deliveries, inventory and janitorial work all for a dollar above minimum wage. "
good,"not the best or worst place to work it really depends on what store you are working in. you do a lot of work for very little pay and get abused by ""lead"" technicians who think they are in charge"
good,"CVS, while a large and profitable company it is not a great place to work in my experience.  The culture, if one could call it culture, is comprised of several different companies, purchased and bonded together seemingly ad-hoc."
good,"The store that I transferred to had the hours I was looking for, but the management is without words I can say. So many things I seen wrong and unprofessional and management using their authority to their advantage in certain situations and to retaliate against employees they disliked. The store I left was NOTHING like this and I would have never had left, if i was not going to college full time during  the day."
good,"To be quite honest I loved my job at CVS but there was no room for advancement. They offer what is called intern senior team, and senior team, intern sup and a sup. So basically you apply for the intern spot and if you are selected you have an opportunity to compete for the hiring position. Be mindful being intern does not come with pay raise, so you are required to do more work for same base pay. And even if you rock at that position they may not hire anyone that was picked and may hire from outside the company."
good,Pharmacists and techs were like family. All tried to accommodate facilities and residents to the best to their abilities. Very caring and productive. Omnicare as a whole cared more about money than their employees
good,"Hard workers are taken advantage of in this company. A great place to ""work"" for those who look to ride the coat tails of the the few who do work. Double standards."
good,"Process new referral and report benefits once received. If accepted move forward with getting patient set up with in home IV service to include delivery of medication and nursing."
good,Its a nice place to work if you like interacting and creating relationships with people but the store I worked at had a messy staff everyone wanted to talk about other co-workers and i felt like I should have received more compensation for the amount of work that I put in. Also when the position to became a manager became available my store manager made it to where with me being a student i was automatically disqualified from moving up in the company due to the requirements
good,"A typical work day at CVS is extremely stressful if you care about completing tasks. On almost a monthly basis, we have been given more tasks to complete with not enough hours to complete the increasing workload."
good,"Working for CVS was rewarding at times, but most of the time you feel as if you are doing more work then you are being paid for and the good things don't outweigh the minimal care it has for it's employees or the customers."
good,"CVS can be a great job! Some of the managers aren’t always on the same page which can sometimes cause stresses on the job! On the bright side, it’s ultimately satisfying to help others out!"
good,"OK place to work.  Benefits too high,  paid low for work load. Great life insurance policy. "
good,"Coram is a poorly organized company, especially since it was bought by CVS.  Large projects are rolled out slowly and with much confusion, management does not communicate well with staff, there is very little staff engagement and appreciation (not even a holiday party)."
good,"started well, due to poor upper management work load increased, limited workers. hardest part was having to work double shifts at different locations due to poor staffing. I learned more about pharmaceuticals. I enjoyed my coworkers."
good,"I worked at 2 separate locations, and their initial offer was close to minimum wage but after I had a competing offer they were able to match. Which was a additional $5. "
good,"Very fast paced environment. If you enjoy retail and working with people then it is the place for you. If not then do not apply. Overall, the hardest part is being the middleman between customers and the insurance companies. EVERYTHING is your fault and you must act accordingly so."
good,"Gostei de trabalhar na empresa, mesmo quando prometeram acensão de carreira e não foi concretizada, muito bem estruturada, com apoio ao profissional, mas também com administração voltada a punir o profissional ( característica da gestão na época)."
good,"I worked mainly in Denton. Long hours, very busy, poor staffing at times (due to poorly allocated hours), and unfair pay. Raises were a joke, and supervisors didn't discipline manager's unacceptable behavior."
good,I have been a Pharmacy Technician for 23 year's. CVS only paid me 13.65 an hour and I am certified. They did not offer insurance unless you have worked there for a year or more.
good,"CVS pays a great salary, but the company does not value dedicated employees.  The company needs to give adequate employee assistance in the pharmacy service area."
good,I learned about pharmacy work and how to do inventory and receive product and help customers.  Management was good.  I just didn't like how the pharmacist were always changing.
good,"As easy as I might seem to be, customers are always mad and make the days unbearable. Management not helpful. You'll be stressed out all the time. Lots of standing. some days can be chill, but usually ends with some customer ruining it."
good,The over all feeling of CVS is very impersonal.  I had a very good team i worked with and we tried to make it not the typical experience at a pharmacy .
good,Pay is not fair. There is also some favoritism. Lack of hours and pay. The manager is nice to work for and coworkers are great. Clean environment and you stay busy
good,"There are some great people there. However, nothing there is consistent management shows favoritism, half hour unpaid lunches, high call volume, bad attitudes in a lot of departments and no one is really passionate about the patients I believe that is why the turnover is high."
good,"this workplace is really stressful whether or not you are achieving company desires goal. You are constantly beat by your immediately supervisor. No time to complete work, and staying after business hours with no pay. No lunch break on 10-14 hours shift."
good,There was never a day where you weren't busy. A lot of angry customers. Schedules were given every Sunday for the following week schedule with split days off.
good,"A company as cvs the problem is not the name is the people who work there, no communication, lot of drama, to much of favoritism.Work with a lot back stabbers"
good,"CVS taught me a lot about working with the public. I enjoyed being able to interact with multiple types of people and learning about parts of the medical field. It taught me multitasking, working with multiple computer systems, decoding, and much more,"
good,CVS Rotates employees like a factory. They have little to no compensation and you'll earn pay raises of pennies on the dollar. It's okay for a college student like me who needed something flexible
good,Only take this job if its the last resort supervisor is horrible as a new hire I wasn't even introduced to the team. People are not friendly and the culture is very dry. I feel so out of place here.
good,I just had to leave it because i had no time with my family and it was a long drive. It was located in la habra and to leave two ahead to beat traffic.
good,"Drive Through, Quality Assurance, Everything is timed (answering the phones, voicemail, drive through, production) Daily metrics are important. flu shots and vaccines are pushed"
good,"Great place to work, but there are a lot of internal politics. I was in Prod Supp team, work was too hectic. For some days need to work on weekends most probably a lot of weeks. Will get calls at midnight too. We are few members in the team and flow of tickets are very high."
good,"Not good pay, Understaffed and not enough hours, doesn't pay well. the training was great , and the pharmacy manager in my store was top notch. Okay for a side hussle job"
good,"They have an insane points system if you are late, or call out. After a certain about of points you are fired. The managers seem like they have no powers to make on the spot decisions."
good,"Job that requires you to multitask have learned a lot being with the company, however too much work for not the best pay you have your workers that go above and beyond and you have others that you wonder how they were considered for the position."
good,must be good with customers. must be good at filling prescriptions.  The location at the time I worked there was pleasant. The management team when I was there was pleasant as well.
good,"The warehouse is very dirty & dusty, and the management didn't treat their customer clients very well.You can wear whatever you want, so you can wear basketball shorts or either button downs, but steel toes would hurt your feet after standing up over 10hours."
good,"Nurse supervisor for infusion team specialist; Director of Nursing for HHA infusion specialty; Ambulatory Director; scheduling, payroll, patient education, PICC, Central and Port educator for area Agencies and HHA nurses. Management working with Pharmacy in making decisions on patient care. "
good,"Processed transactions and collected payments, efficiently and in accordance with company’s policies and procedures; made sales referrals, resolved customer issues and offered assistance as requested; greeted customers upon entry and exit of store."
good,"This employer is new concept however instead of working at making it a success they have continues to rely on the old employees from all over the organization to train. Allowing this means that the old habits are continuing to happen  "
good,"I've been there since October, promised full time and a raise when I got my state license.  None of it has happened as of yet, except I got my state license-no full time and no raise!! They not only did not make full time, they hired more full time people and I STILL have no full time or raise."
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician in a retail pharmacy is a very rewarding job, but it is a very fast paced and stressful environment and requires a patient and caring individual to adequately preform daily duties. I love being a pharmacy technician but I do not feel there is much room for growth in a retail pharmacy, and am ready to move on and learn different skills in a different environment."
good,"This is still retail, you're going to have to expect coming in that you won't be getting any possible hours since unless highly needed. That being said, prepare to learn a lot without pharmacy knowledge."
good,"The manager makes or breaks this job. Whoever is higher than you can make your job feel like a godsend, or like absolute garbage. They cut hours year after year and expect exorbitant amounts of work to be done."
good,Has  a culture that reminds workers they are replaceable. I will still recommend it because of the great pay. It is extremely stressful and I am not sure it is worth the pay
good,I worked at cvs at one location but helped out at others for 10 years straight I have tons of mangers and 1 head pharmacist with other staff pharmacist I met a lot off good ppl one manger was horrible
good,"It is a Good job if you are in College. Trying to Make a living at this job is difficult .Its a good place to start for a new Tech starting out."
good,"Overworked and underpayed. Required to work many aspects and underpayed/under appreciated. Have to deal with many unhappy customers. Tight and cramped behind the pharmacy counter but required to be ""running"" speed while working at all hours. Busy from open to close."
good,CVS can be a great place to work. If you are an entry level technician you will learn a lot about drugs and order processing. How an individual feels about their job experience will depend greatly on their team which they will heavily rely on and interact with as well as the interactions they have with their customers.
good,"The people you work with can be great, however it was under staffed during my time, so the workload was sometimes overwhelming. The pay is not very competitive."
good,Chronic corporate understaffing made job difficult and customers angry when things were not done in time. Constant harassment from upper management to obtain near impossible metrics
good,"Responsible for taking inbound calls from and placing outbound calls to patients regarding prescription mail order claims. Required to enter accurate information into a multi-screen computer application. Worked on a recorded, monitored phone system which required employees to be logged in and available to service members during scheduled work hours. Comprehensive training, including training on computer applications, workflows/processes, basic drug therapy information and any HIPAA information was provided."
good,"When entering, filling, checking, and even selling prescriptions you need to do it in a certain amount of time or there is repercussions. This does not allow pharmacists to spend their time caring for the patients (leads to decreased patient understanding of their medications)."
good,Enjoyed my fellow employees but was extremely difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance with a constant changing schedule and working every weekend. Low pay rate so tech turn over is high.
good,"I have been working with CVS for 2 years now, and I feel that most employees are very under valued and overworked. I feel that CVS expects a lot out of it's employees but does not offer efficient training or understanding of certain jobs."
good,"Translating prescription,answering phones,calling doctor's offices,calling patients,calling insurance companies,ordering medication,inventory medication,"
good,The work place is good but they want to cover so much that their is not time to have a patient pharmacist interaction. Patients are just a number. It is a prescription factory .
good,From start to finish your day is just pack pack pack. Very hard physical labor beyond what they told me in the interviewing process. Very high turnover rate because of this.
good,"Was started out at the lowest allowable rate to higher someone, after years of asking for a raise I found out that you are only allowed a certain percent on what you make to for you for you to make more."
good,The people are incredible but the management are extremely unhelpful and do not empower the workers to do a good job and grow. They have good resources and tech but no real vision or leadership.
good,"Overworked because they had long hours and the management did not know how to reduce the hours. they did not have the proper tools needed to get the job done. they hired people outside of the building that came in holding high positions but didn't know what they were doing. The hardest part of the job was trying to the job effectively, efficiently and keeping a steady rate for long hours while not having the proper tools needed to do the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting most of the people that worked there."
good,"In recent years, the workplace culture at CVS seems to have shifted from that of respected healthcare provider to a factory.  With every little task being monitored, scored, and timed, it's nearly impossible to keep up with the demands and provide a high level of care to patients.  Additional tasks are constantly being added to the workload, with a constant reduction in support staff."
good,My experience working at CVS was a great one. I learned a lot in a fast paced and busy environment. The management was overall helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job and my experience working at CVS was helping people and the positive response and vibe I got from them.
good,"•	Responsible for coding the client plan design within the adjudication support system(s)."
good,"the only thing I didn't like were the bad hours and the manager would make the schedule, then catch his mistakes halfway through a schedule and put someone to work a day they were off and not tell the worker, and if they worker wouldn't show up he/she would get in trouble."
good,Very busy working on the computer and making phone calls.Go to lunch with my friends. How to search for information on the computer and verifying information using different programs.Calling the facilities to get profile information on the patients. Management not very helpful unable to answer questions.  Providing service to nursing homes and patients so patients get there medicines on time.When the computers don't work are there very slow. it is hard to get the work done in a timely manner. Meeting new people getting to know them and learning more skills to make my job easier..I like my job I like to keep busy.
good,"The company tries to make the most profit with the least amount of staffing,  basically they overwork people. Hard work is under appreciated, too much pressure to meet the ""numbers"", come up with new programs and expectations every year but no increase in staffing levels."
good,"I worked overnight. Management changed a bunch over the years. Unloaded trucks in the rain, helped on audits, organizing, pushing overstock, making the manager looked good when he did nothing. I never felt appreciated for any of my hardwork. People were being hired for more than what I was making and doing less than what I was doing. I met a lot of amazing people customers and coworkers. I also didn't enjoy the drunks, crazies, homeless, rude college kids and wannabe gangsters. I would of stayed if they offered reasonable pay for my workload."
good,High turnover and not enough staff to cover daily tasks. High stress level. Long hour shifts up to 13 hours a day with no breaks. Good health benefits.
good,"If you are looking to be a manager of people,"
good,"The acquired the company I worked at, absorbed our customers over several months and then let most of the employees go. Not much more to say."
good,I only worked there for about a year. I was a cashier and worked the one hour photo and was also the American Greetings Clerk. Was able to learn cash handing skills.
good,"Overall it's only enjoyable to work in the pharmacy because of my teammates.  The management we work with at this location every day are wonderful and really try to make it a good place to work, bu they also understand that we aren't exactly compensated for our hard work.  Daily issues range from needing to call patients and inform them we don't have their required drug in stock to insurance issues that require the tech to call the company and try to resolve the issue."
good,"don't be a second late or you will be written up. "
good,"A typical day involves a hundred tasks, with little time or man power to do them. And delivering the best customer service. This is a customer orienyrd company. Some good things some bad things. Overall good. I learned how to be an amazing manager. Ive learned the skills to be able to run any store, with the smallest budget, and still deliver top notch customer service and a wonderfully merchandised store."
good,Learned the insurance world. Made good friends. A good starting position for anyone interested in working on 3rd party insurance claims.
good,"I loved this store, and believe me; stores differ. But my store was best. Everyday retail pharmacy and everything that comes with it. Try it out for yourself. I believed in my store, because we had teamwork, great attitudes and a strong bond."
good,Great to have cafe on location probably because the breaks and lunches are so short you need something on location to grab a bite to eat. The parking is also VERY bad you move your car and you will have to park very far.
good,eat before you go to work wear good shoes smile a lot and keep your on your production  and make friends with everyone that works in the pharmacy and the front store
good,"This job is a wonderful job because it requires you to be fast, able to multitask, learn many things such as medical terminology, and has many chances to interact with patients. But, the only downfall is that it is indeed, a lot of work for the amount they pay."
good,A typical work day at CVS is very stressful . Theirs a lot that happens at CVS everyday that you have to take care of. I learned that the customer is #1. At CVS we had to make sure they where always taken care of. I always did the training for our dept and payroll. I also did all expense reports for our dept.I also developed training manuals for our dept.I was in charge of Hotel and Flight reservations and car rentals.
good,"Overall, this job isn't bad. It is a very busy, fast paced facility. "
good,Constantly changing policies that sometimes contradict each other. Expectation are clearly stated. Very face paced but underpay positions.
good,"Extremely busy work environment,last minute urgency task enforced by management,mirco managing pharmacy,short on support staff hours.Excellent coworkers and enjoyed building relations with patients.Everything you do is by short time constrain to meet management expected goals."
good,No lack of work. Once your training you are set on your way. Questions are answered pretty quickly. Like all places plenty of room for improvement. A great place if you like to work really hard.
good,i enjoyed working there but it was a high turn over rate. they barely kept pharmacist and pharmacy technicians. they pay was okay but they could pay better based on all of the work that we do.
good,not conducive to employers no opportunity to grow professionally very scanty technician help failure to retain good techs/pharmacist
good,i completed 200 hours of extern with hopes of getting hired within the company and other locations. I was trained in certain areas of the pharmacy but felt i did not LEARN enough and this particular extern site was not hiring
good,"Overall very poor project management which leads to bad forecasting with failed projects and obsessively abusing the H1B1. Class driven culture where only managers talk to managers, no open door policy here..."
good,"It was ok, I always liked all my jobs :) "
good,"A typical day at work CVS Health entails interacting with customers, filling numerous prescriptions, filing prescription, answering phone calls, helping customers locate certain items and imputing numerous insurance claims. What I have excelled in the most is imputing insurance information into the CVS system. This requires years of experience. I have also acquired great knowledge in regards to the various pharmaceutical drugs and their uses. My pharmacy manager is a new graduate who makes us all feel appreciated. I have great respect for her considering she works 48 hours a week and gets paid for 40. My co workers are the greatest asset to the pharmacy. Pharmacy technicians in general I feel are the most important asset to a pharmacy. The hardest part of my job is the ever challenging language barrier between myself and the diverse community of where I work. However, through this challenge I have greatly improved in my Spanish speaking ability. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the great customers of the community. Being able to help a different person everyday is one of the many benefits of working at CVS Health."
good,"Very busy workplace, I often did not even get a lunch break. On the other hand, they do provide training to further your career within the pharmacy. It is paid training as well."
good,Management needs more training and some co-workers need training on working with others.  The hardest part of this job is standing on the feet all day.  The best part of the job is meeting the customers.
good,"CVS bought Target Pharmacy in December of 2015.  I was not provided enough training for the new computer system.   Only managers at CVS are provided e-mail addresses, so it was difficult to talk to anyone in management positions directly.  The scheduling team provided a six week schedule only 10 days before it was in effect.   The scheduling team also assigned stores that were over 85 miles away from my home (one way) for multiple days without offering a hotel."
good,"What you would expect with a serving position in a restaurant. Fun to interact with new people every day. Management would try to work around your schedule and give you hours that work for you.  Pay wasn't always great, sometimes very good though. Fun job, hard on feet!"
good,"As in all retail, typical day assisting customers with there needs. co-workers are team players and there when needed. Management seems to rotate in out, so change is constant. The hardest part is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable is helping, the sweetest, most kindest customers an employee can ask for."
good,"Overall, CVS was a good work experience. There are a few things that tend to not be so good, but that is true for most warehouse workplaces. I would recommend people apply for employment there."
good,Very easy to get used to but all the hard work for absolutely no pay. If you do get a raise it would be only 10 or 15 cents. But the feeling to help out the patients makes you feel good. But CVS only pays good for pharmacist and lead techs. All of the regular technicians are expendable.
good,"A typical day at work meant dealing with angry customers and dissatisfied patients."
good,CVs is a very stressful environment to work in. the managers dont care about the employees at all. ..
good,"Working here has been much different from what I initially expected. The work isn't too bad it's just getting everything done on time. The worst part of the job from my experience is having to run back and forth between patients and doing other jobs in the pharmacy. I also hate that there is not set schedule. So you may come in 3 times in one week and 5 the next but at different times. It just makes it difficult to really plan since nothing is set in stone (so to speak)."
good,"Lead pharmacist was very rude and would cuss and yell at employees. Definitely would never go back. The only good experience was when customers were appreciative of the help you gave them with insurance or other issues. However, you also come into contact with ,any angry unsatisfied customers."
good,"Management is wonderful, very appreciative, ive learned a lot, coworkers are very helpful, and we all are team players.the best part of the job is when its the busiest."
good,Although learned inventory control as part of my Pharmacy tech job - which I really enjoyed - the constant understaffing made customer service a daily unpleasant experience.  Customers were very frustrated.  Bathrooms for customers and employees VERY messy and embarrassing. My pharmacists were trying their best with the restraints of the corporation.  lots of employee turnover which is also not great for customer service.  Lines of customers could take up to 20 minutes to go through creating a very hostile consumer base.
good,"Working here was like nothing else I ever seen before. You had the fake and the real, but most of the time it was fake. Never worked for a company that would doc you for every little thing and hold a grudge when you leave, which is very childish. Leaving here was the best thing I could ever do."
good,"A onofre foi comprada pela CVS Health e está em processo de mudança, por isso é um local legal pois está aberto a idéias novas porém não tem uma cultura sólida formada e é uma dança das cadeiras, todos com medo de serem demitidos a qualquer hora."
good,"Definitely what most people would think working in a retail pharmacy would be like.  The best part of the job was the customers, never a dull moment."
good,"IF you know retail...then you know, customers always mad at you for their insurance not covering meds. Also not willing to pay techs put willing to pay pharmacist."
good,"Great place to learn a lot of new things, except there is no room for advancement. "
good,This was my first job right out of high school. This company is more worried about making money than it is about patient care. Working at CVS was very challenging due to the lack of staff. You are expected to work at all stations and maintain patient safety when dealing with medications.
good,"An okay job, not great and not the worst. Management is good and there are few decent floor processors. Lack of communication, incentives, and also discipline for those who do not produce. Lack of order and professionalism."
good,"Okay,its an OK place to work,office atmosphere, would recommend to office people This is not  a valid review .Sample only to get through process."
good,"I applied for my job at CVS to gain pharmacy insight because I was going to be applying for Pharmacy School later that year. However, I was given only 4 hours a week and anything more than that they had me working the front store which wasn't the point of my employment. After MANY hours of training to become a certified pharmacy technician, I only received a 60 cent pay increase."
good,Typical day of work is laid back and flexible. Hardest part of the job is accepting the pay rate and the lack of advancement opportunities and support from management.
good,The work environment is great when you have managers who actually use some of your ideas to improve the store. This is a great job for someone in school in need of part time employment.
good,"Everything depends upon the group  you are in and who you know in other departments.  You need something fixed on your computer, find out who in another department can help you otherwise your request may fall through the cracks.  There are a lot of internal job postings, but if you want to transfer to another department, network your way through as if you applying from the outside."
good,"A typical workday is often stressful at CVS, as CVS does not budget for enough stuff on a daily basis. A lot of running around occurs."
good,"Managers are held to high standards causing much stress and high turnover. Technicians have a range of competency levels, but many are underpaid."
good,"Overall, CVS is a decent place to get your start working as a Tech, if you are a quick learner who can tolerate dealing with harrassing customers and doing the job of more than 1 person, but making very little.  A lot of it has to do with your team, also.  A good team makes all the difference, but if you have a bad Pharmacy Manager and a bad team, you're life will be really rough working there!"
good,Always an impetus on customer satisfaction with no regard for employee satisfaction. One of the most under-staffed Fortune 500 companies out there. Over-extends both management and peon shift workers.
good,"A typical day at work is walking into work to 7 pages of prescriptions to count, multitasking with counting pills , answering the phone, waiting on customers at the registers, and calling on insurance rejects . My job is working at a fast pace and filling perscriptions in a certain time before they are due . I have learned a lot being a tech like figuring out day supplys and how much medication a person will take in the amount of days the doctor pescribed to them, also iv`e learned how to do rebills when a customer brings there insurance card into the pharmacy. I know what medications are for and the generics for them. my co workers are pretty awesome to work with we all keep each other going because with this kinda job it can get challenging .But that`s the fun part and rewarding part about being a pharmacy tech. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers they treat us horrible and always talk down to us no matter how much of a effort and work we put into our job.I have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is learning all the amazing things a pharmacy tech encounters on a day to day basis, and building a frienship  with all your sweet customers .when they walk in the door it`s so awesome to know so much about them and there family and to ask how everyone is doing."
good,You worked on the computers from 9 to 5 with limited information and management was very little help. Sometimes the guide verse the notes we had were off but it was a job.
good,"Need more time, education and training in the benefits department.  This need to start with management.  It was a pleasure for 13 years.  I'm not at all dissatisfied that I'm separated with the company."
good,your job is not guar-an-tee management just bad not the place to work if you have a family 12 hour work days you can get firer for being 1 min late
good,"This is an okay job for me. I had a hard time since the CVS I worked at, no one wanted to train or help. Everyone was miserable or lazy, so they didnt want to train."
good,"Enjoyed working for CVS as a district admin. The work was a bit repetitive but I enjoyed it. Everything was great (pay could have been higher) until I was made a pharmacy scheduler along with my admin duties. Scheduling is not an easy job. Dealing with 80 plus pharmacist, some with horrible attitudes, others with great ones, is a stressful situation. Who wants to be responsible for covering other peoples work schedules when they dont wont to come to work. There issue becomes yours, and you better be able to fill it or its your fault. Along with the scheduling you have to input all the payroll for the pharmacies in your district and be a payroll coordinator. "
good,"Very busy, medium size branch.  Management in disarray with problems filling pharmacy, nursing and branch manager positions.  As such, staff did not have local support for work flow.  Patient care seemed to be driven more by sales team than which patients were appropriate candidates for home care upon discharge from the hospital.  Information about patients came in a disjointed fashion and support staff was so over worked that questions about patient discharge were still being answered after patient had left the hospital-very unsafe.  "
good,Workplace is improving. Job culture is just now improving. Decent benefits. Job security is shaky. Management seems not in control.  Still a long way to go.
good,Employee are way under paid. The only good thing is you can work as many hours as you want because the help is always needed
good,"unfortunately this company no longer exists."
good,"This company only cares about the numbers not about customers. They don't care about their employees and treats them badly and unfairly. I would work a 8-12 hour day and not get a brake and would get treated badly if I demanded one, but a smoker could go out every 2 hours without a problem."
good,"I enjoyed my customers"
good,"Not much mobility if not a nurse or pharmacist,.  Generally trusted to make own decisions.  Clueless management and not much guidance from CVS.  Seems like a poor merger."
good,Very challenging position with lots of quotas to meet.  Loved the personal connection with regular customers. The staff was a great team and very much missed. Had a great partner who was an excellent Pharmacist and a great guy.
good,"A typical day at work would be managing the business from all ends. That would be reviewing and approving financials, meeting cutoff times and company goals. Analyzing data and problem solving to provide a customer response within 24-48 hours was also part of a typical day."
good,"They are very overtime friendly, but they do not fairly compensate. They work with you to make sure you are comfortable with your schedule, and they have a excellent trainer."
good,Since cvs/caremark merged the company lost it's family value and also employee values. It's a great company to move up in as well as they at least give you training and that's rare in the newer companies today. CVS's benefits use to be good but not so much anymore. It's a tough working business and very cliquy.
good,I had a wonderful supervisor.Did not like the fact your hours can change at any time.You have to work so hard for so little pay.You do not get any breaks except your lunch break
good,"My work environment is fun at times, but also a bit hectic. It's a really big company but it doesn't appear to be much room for advancement.  The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting patients and the medical staff at the facilities."
good,A typical day at the pharmacy is to acknowledge and serve all customers with excellent service. Provide assistance to the pharmacy on duty
good,"Very chaotic...works for you if you like to be ""all over the place"" You are just thrown in and not given any formal training. You are expected to know the job and all aspects while shown 1 example. 99.9% of patients do not fit this example.  Long hours and set hours do not exist."
good,"Assisting all customers in finding a better way to health, helping with prescriptions and information id understanding thier benefits."
good,"As with most places management plays favorites.  Also, management unwilling to work towards the future office work i.e. working remotely."
good,"the work environment was really good, however the availability to grow in the company is very limited. the management team was great and the training process was really good."
good,"Its a good job, i enjoy the coworkers that i was surrounded with. At CVS i learned how to talk to people better and how to compensate customers if they cant find something that they want at the moment, also i learned the cash register, learning the cash register i learned how to greet customers over the phone, money gram, refunds, and coupons. The hardest part about my job would probably be the overnight shifts and the heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part of the job would be when i have genuine conversations with the customers."
good,Progressing at CVS is very slow. The initial hiring rate is very low and it takes forever to get a raise. Its a fast pace environment and the work pressure is high.
good,"I learned the basics of customer service and HIPAA privacy. I learned how to do out of dates and return medications that were expired right away. CVS had a counting machine, which I don't use at my current job, we use trays and count pills individually. I learned how to work a drive through service and what retail meant. That you helped the entire store. I learned how to stand on my feet in one spot all day, which is also different from my current retail pharmacy job where I am constantly moving all over and multi-tasking. I don't think this position was very hard other than it seemed to go by very slow, but I like helping my patients and was just learning the ropes."
good,overall okay company to work for. it can be hard at times to deal with the customers and their needs because it seems they want everything now and right.
good,"A typical day at CVS/pharmacy (an entity of CVS Health), is stressful, but also a great learning experience.  I have learned how to manage technicians, as well as inventory and financial records.  I have also gained much experience in working with the public and insurance companies.  The hardest part of my current job is work life balance.  In order to accomplish all expectations, it is often necessary to spend at least sixteen hours at the pharmacy per day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when a patient thanks me and openly appreciates my time and efforts, as this is not often expressed.  When a customer does take the time to thank me, it truly reminds me why I am a pharmacist and often makes my day."
good,"This position is very demanding. You have to pay attention to detail and read the prescription correctly. The co-workers are helpful and work hard on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is you learn something new everyday, and of course the new people you meet."
good,"CVS's goal is to be sure you never get your ""promised"" year end bonus.  Every move is scrutinized.  I had a partner pharmacist who was always me to take his weekend so he could show his horsed.  He always said he'd pay me back.  In 2 years he never did.  I was threatened with death by a man who wanted his pain pills filled early - essentially wanting me to commit insurance fraud.  When I reported this to my supervisor, instead of telling me to report this man to the authorities, my supervisor said I should be more understanding of people with chronic pain!.  This patient's doctor was even afraid of him.  "
good,"the company and store manager usually do NOT care for their employees.  often problems arose from other workers, and you would get blamed. management as far as store level is prejudice and unfair.  co workers were basically stuck and forced to work at cvs as i was, most times didn't get a break working 10 hours on feet all day, no manager caring about breaks"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, but the supervisor I worked under created a hostile environment. If management works on making sure their supervisors treat their employees properly, this will be a great place to work."
good,I learned so much working  here. However the turn over is very high. This made it difficult to work there. This job doesn't have many opportunities for advancement.
good,"A day to day grind of the same job. That didn't challenge me or utilize my experience.Management was close door policy that didn't want to hear even the slightest area's that could be improved on.Punch put your eight hour's in and leave, not much of a challenge."
good,Management is not understanding your environment. blaming's about your work is all the excuses they have for not producing enough while they don't have a well trained staff
good,"The pay is great, benefits are great. Office runs like a nut house, management is too busy socializing to address questions or concerns by employees. If you are not in the ""clique"" you are screwed. Average work week is about 60 hrs including saturdays and occasional mandatory sundays. There is a rotating ""on call"" schedule, you will work over night an average of 3 weeks per year, but also be required to work your regular shift. You will be paid $100 for the ""on call""."
good,"My coworkers and Pharmacists were wonderful, however this company as a whole is not a desirable employer. Tech hours have been cut on a regular basis over time to allow for budget cuts, leading to very disgruntled techs who are expected to deliver excellent service regardless of the lack of staff. Pharmacists work 10 to 12 hour shifts without a lunch break. There is no room to advance, and I am hardly recognized for my superior, above-and-beyond work ethic. The compensation is terrible."
good,"typical day is very busy place, co workers are fun to work with , the hardest part of the job at  coram is making no mistakes .the most enjoyable of the job its satisfying the patients and hearing them compliment about the services we provide for them."
good,"I worked for Omnicare and gained alot of experience. I worked hard on 3rd shift. We got a lot done, i made new friends but the pay was horrible! I made my money in overtime. I worked doubles two-three times a week. I say work there for experience and money."
good,"everyday is a busy day at work. i learnt priotization. management is not as bad is everyone is on the same page and knows exactly what is expected. co-workers are awesome, hardest part of the job is soo much is expected with little or no help. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a great team to work with."
good,My review is really not  for public knowledge. Everyone has their own opinion and it is my opinion that I keep to myself
good,Too much pressure placed on one employee without adequate compensation.
good,"CVS is a great place to work but the managers are horrible. They talk to you any type of way, always threatening to fire you. They talk about you with others and they show a lot of favoritism."
good,"A typical day is very short, usually prior authorizations are finished by 9 p.m... when I signed on, I didn't know that I would be working part time hours, I could have stayed at my current job, I thought CVS was a good company to advance.... my work schedule is suppose to be 6pm-2:30am but its only 6pm-12pm,,,I have learned a lot in processing prior authorization and a lot of different systems...management is not accessible, they all leave at 7p.m. so if I have a problem I will have to email them and wait for the response next business day...my co-workers are pretty nice, I do enjoy working with my co-workers, some are very helpful, we all have the same concerns, the hardest part of the job is not being able to get help thru management, my most enjoyable part is I am getting to learn new things thru the different systems."
good,"A typical work day consisted of helping customers, answering phones, entering refills and correcting any issues that came about.  I enjoy working with my co-workers, we worked as a team and got the job done. The hardest part about my job was always bring understaffed and trying to make sure all customers were taken care of. What I enjoyed most was the the team I worked with because we knew how to make each other laugh which was good because our jobs were highly stressful."
good,"It keeps you on your toes , you have to keep your rate at a 100%, to give a 100% in customer service."
good,"Most of the required work is done independently and each day goes by quickly. You're almost always busy and motivated to reach a quota, which I enjoy. Most people put on headphones and listen to music all day while getting in their ""zone""."
good,In a nine year span. Nothing ever changed.....working conditions not favorable
good,"A typical day at Cvs Pharmacy can be somewhat exciting. You'll never know what type of people you'll meet on a daily basics. I've learned a lot from Cvs from advanced technician skills to small things such as patience and excellent customer service. I don't not believe there is a hard part of the job, I just treat each customer with the same respect and professionally service I would like to recieve"
good,Ok enviorment. some mangagement issues. cool coworkers but alot of gossip
good,"Verified insurance benefits"
good,Hardest part is working 6 days straight with an every other weekend
good,"You're constantly doing something from filling prescriptions to pulling out-of-dates to making customer service phone calls. You're on your feet all day working 10-12 hours shifts with only one 30 minute lunch break. After 6PM You're not allowed to take a break."
good,"Assisting customers with medical needs and medication, very fast paced."
good,Never know if they are going to down size or not. You just don't know how many hours your really going to work.
good,"Learned a lot of collection law information, learned lots of business practices."
good,My day was most of the time long but fun. I enjoy the work I was doing and working with my coworker. The hardest part was the long hours and work every wkend at one point.
good,"The pay was Ok, but working here was like new slavery. I worked the first shift, was from 4am-12pm as a cherry picker. They wanted us to be fast and move production in a timely matter but equipment was too slow. Or either the machine you opperate didnt have all proper equipment on it."
good,"When I first started working for CVS I loved it, the company was great to their employees. Over the years however, they began to care less about the employees and more about profit margins. Being a previous business owner I do realize the importance of having a profit, but I am also aware it is not the only thing to keeping a successful business in operation."
good,we have been through 4 managers in the last year and there in just no organization or accountability. If it wasnt for some of the amazing staff and customers i wouldn't have stayed so long but now. i do enjoy what i do. the customers and the impact i make of peoples life. i have heard bad things about this company and never believed it but after working there i understand why people would not want to stay there for long periods.
good,"I have learned a lot while working here. This is a good company, but there really is no room for advancement."
good,"It was a decent place to work but management changed regularly so it was hard to keep up with all the changes. "
good,wasnt a friendly staff and didnt get you enough time to complete your classes and online test and work at the same time.
good,"CVS is a solid company,but it lacks career growth opportunity.  If one is happy staying at the same level and comfortable in knowing more will be asked without recognition, it is a solid place of employment."
good,"Typical day at CVS is going to be the same every day. You go in, clock in, count, type, and ring people up. Being lead tech there are alot more responsibilities involved. There is alot you can learn in this pharmacy, especially when you have pharmacist who are willing to teach. Pharmacist and techs (most of them) that I worked with are awesome, but upper management (especially district manager) could use some people skills. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with all the pharmacy metrics in which they grade you in, and trying to maintain high numbers. It can be flat out frustrating/irritating. Also it is difficult when the pharmacy supervisor limits the amount of hours in a busy pharmacy and stuff doesn't get done because of the lack of staff. Most enjoyable part is the amount you can learn and working with great people. Upper management is what makes this job more stressful than the job needs to be. The DM I work with lets her employees know that they are very replaceable. Not very good working conditions as far as job stability goes. The turnover rate in this place is astonishing. In the past year i've seen 3 different store managers, and about 10 shift managers leave, and they ALL quit because of the DM. Also the ""fast food"" mentality that the customers have can get frustrating to deal with. Also there is VERY little room for advancement. There are Pharmacy Techs, Inventory Specialist (10x more work with no increase in pay), Lead Techs, and Interns. The only pay raises are to either lead tech or to go to pharmacy school and become an intern. Yearly raises are something"
good,Communication is very poor. I hear more info from store management about loss prevention than from my supervisors.
good,Extremely busy pharmacy and short staff. Stressful work environment.
good,"My review summary should be the perfect indicator of all aspects of working at Omnicare. I come into work. I do the best I can to complete the work assigned to me with the tools that management gives me. The staff is the best thing they have going for them, however there is little recognition for the people who work the hardest. The most difficult part of being employed by at Omnicare is knowing that the company has the potential to be so much greater then they allow themselves to be.The most enjoyable part of the day is the final hour of my shift. Just knowing that the only thing seperating me from my family at home is sixty minutes."
good,"I really did not enjoy working at this place for many reasons."
good,"CVS is a great company, but the management style has changed where you are given workloads to do."
good,"Greeting the customers, checking in/out patients all while providing excellent customer service."
good,"It is always busy, you'll rarely be bored. you'll appreciate a little free time."
good,"Most days were very, very busy with a non- stop line of customers. The good thing about this, is that a work day would go by Very fast. The bad thing was sometimes we would not get our 10 min breaks."
good,"Typical day at work is very busy which makes time fly by, I learned how to work the photo department and over rides and how to better assist a customer and how to handle hard situations and make the customer happy.  Management was horrible, they had their favorites and was not at all equal.  Co workers were good, help when needed but they could of left their personal life outside of work. Didn't really have a hard part of the job."
good,"This is where i learned the most about pharmacy. A typical day would involve inputting, and filling prescriptions."
good,"Running register up front and in the pharmacy, building end cap sale display's, building seasonal aisle , I learned to multi task at whole new level.  Management there was all about who the DM liked the most and not about the job.  Co-workers were great but also talked about the unfairness of promotions within the company, the most difficult part of the job was to try and be in two places at the same time.  Working with the public I enjoy talking to people and hearing there feedback."
good,"Worked 14 day straight then 2 days off then worked 21 days straight with no comp time.  Clients tripled, but staff remained the same and we still had the same deadlines to complete.  Stressful  environment."
good,Greet customers and offer help.  Always treat people the way you want to be treated.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you know you have helped  someone today.
good,"It was a very fast pace Pharmacy, always making sure things were going in order. Learning to work the pick up window when there was down time."
good,"A typical day at work was just clocking in and completing the required duties for that day. Such as completing transactions, cleaning store. Processing damages and call a manager if assistance is needed. At the particualr store there were usually just two people working the store. I learned a lot about interacting with other people and be able to look passed the situation and see the person inside. The hardest part of my job was containing my emotions when conversing with an extremely ill person. I loved that I was able to form a bond with not just my co-workers but my customers as well."
good,"I love what I do. I have worked at several locations within the company and the basic requirements of my job are great. I learn new things almost every day, and I have become very knowledgeable about medications, interactions, and insurance billing. I have reached the ""ceiling"" as far as advancement in my company, and would like the opportunity to grow within a company. I have been managing anywhere from 3 to 14 employees since 2010. I have great management skills, and I am able to delegate tasks easily as required."
good,The company was very challenging to work for. It was constantly busy and always changing. I enjoyed what I did on a daily basis and loved that it pushed me to learn and try new things.
good,"Its all about numbers."
good,"A typical day at work is usually fun, but there are days where it can be really stressful. I've Learned everything there is to know about being a CPhT at CVS Pharmacy, being hired from a student really helped me get accustomed to the company. Management, is hit and miss, again depending on the store you are at. Most managers will always do their best to accommodate you, but a lot of times it is way beyond their powers. The hardest part of the job is having to tell customers something that isn't going to make them happy, such as a medication not being covered, or doctor hasn't faxed back a request. I am always on the customers side, so seeing customers become upset never feels right to me. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you see Great improvement from a patient, the smile on their face makes everything you do worth while."
good,It has its up and downs as with every job. The company is very unorganized and this are always changing
good,"flexible hours, good staff, the hours were late so i didnt like that, having to work til two in the morning was not something to look forward to. not enough pay for the amount of work done. "
good,"they really should pay the pharmacy technician more, they work so hard and also work crazy hours just to be under payed........"
good,"Store management is great. However, driven by corporate numbers cant honestly care for patients first to achieve what is asked by corporate. "
good,To work with CVS Caremark is the hardest part of job. To deal with TCS Management is the hardest part of my life.
good,fast paced and somewhat unorganized for such a large company.   I love the work i do but when omnicare buys out companies that have been bought out numerous times and all the old employees are not effectively trained in omnicare policies and procedures.  It feels like your flying by the seat of your pants and creates a massive amount of stress.
good,Constantly interacting with customers and solving problems in a professional manner. Have some team players that are always willing to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is explaining insurance issues at times. I have learned that I enjoy others aspects of pharmacy outside of retail pharmacy.
good,"A very busy growing pharmacy. In 2006 we were doing under 900 prescriptions per week and as of 2013 we are averaging over 1800 prescriptions each week, Many new programs helpin customers manage their medications came into existence, and giving immunization training was a welcome addition to my services."
good,I enjoy working for the company and the employee discount. The store manger is able to work with our schedules and gives us the amount of hours we are willing to work. The hardest part might be dealing with difficult rude customers. Over all the rewards of the job out weight the bad days.
good,Easy data entry job reciving incoming calls to order meds.By mail
good,I worked there for little less than two years and had four different managers. I was never guaranteed hours and was lucky if I got more than twenty hours per week. They did not seem to like when I would take time off for school even if I had paid out of pocket for it in advance. I was promised a supervisor position which I was never given nor was I given a raise which I was told was legally supposed to happen. If you want a part time job then this is a good place.
good,Very demanding long days no time for family or life outside CVS
good,"I enjoyed working with the team I was with especially the team that was together for the previous 4 years. We knew each others strengths and weaknesses and complimented each other. Our Supervisor,was extremely good in his leadership ability and was loved and respected by all. Unfortunately, this group was separated in the last year. The calls that came in towards the end of our tenure was not distributed evenly and a few of us were often times busier than others and had to put up with distractions from other associates who were not taking calls. The management at our facility, did the best that they could with the information they received. However, the mangement of the CVS/Caremark left much to be desired, We were promised job placement, no such thing has occurred."
good,"A typical day of work most customers will be happy with the service they received but there is always one or two people who were not completely satisfied with their insurance denying certain prescribed drug or a doctor not following through immediately on a patients request and we as technicians are caught in the fire so to speak. Onre can learn continuosly on the job whether it be from the pharmacists or from insurance companies about formularies or preferred drugs. I get along with all my co-workers, they are easy to work with and I believe we work very well as a team. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer their prescription is a non preferred drug and that the doctor needs to contact the insurance company for them to accept the claim or telling them their prescription is not ready. I really like when customers take the time to tell you thank you before they leave especially when you went above and beyond for the customer, it gives self fulfilment to know that they are satisfied. We also have some good interactions with the customers that come in the store and we have good laughs together."
good,"Working for this company was a wonderful experience. I was originally a transfer from Goldsboro, NC. I was an immediate hire. My everyday consisted of opening the pharmacy, putting away orders, empty fill queque of new or refilled prescritions, make sure fast movers were shelved and plentiful, make doctor calls. The head pharmacist I worked under was motivated and young. Her and I worked hand and hand. I loved working for her because it was not about her being the boss but being a co-worker that had a professional understanding of what had to be done within the work day. I had 2 technicians under me which I set their weekly schedule. I enjoyed when my new customers became my regular customers because I knew they were recieving the best service and it was always over and beyond. The hardest part was when I see a patient whos insurance did not pay for her and her husbands prescription, sometimes they would cry but the pharmacist was helpful and understanding."
good,A typical day at work consists of smelly customers and lots of laughs. I love the people I work with and love to go to work everyday.
good,A typical day at CVS can be very busy. There is a lot to do and a lot to learn a bout the job. I have acquired many skills as a pharmacy technician that I know I can use in the future at another job. The hardest part about the job is the high volume. With a good team you can get through a day easily. I really like my coworkers and being able to help people in my community.
good,"co workers were nice, the hardest part of the job was staying a float in such a busy enviroment, i enjoyed working with the customers but did not like their training for new co workers"
good,"greeting customers in store as well as answering phones for customers outside the store services, photo duties."
good,"High Class operation, management was treated like management. All store were staffed properly and operationally was top notch."
good,I had applied for position was told it was full time work was not people who came in after me not certified ( I am) were given more hours and higher pay. The schedules made here were ridiculous
good,easy they expected to much of one person managment not to good communication
good,Worked there for 5 years.....Was very loyal to the company and to my co-workers.....administrative staff the first to be cut when the RIFs stated.
good,6 hrs shift ..Was crossed trained in different areas. Management was great. Not enough staff to train. Enjoyable time was creating several activities.
good,Constant changes
good,"Very hectic work place with little to no recognition that you did a good job. They ask you to come in on your scheduled days off, and don't appreciate when you do it. There is no room to advance when you become a pharmacy technician... you can only become a lead technician. But there can only be one lead tech to each store."
good,everyone there seems far too stressed.
good,We never have enough help in the pharmacy. Everyone is overworked or has no hours at all. It is so stressful because of the lack of help. It is very difficult to balance your work and personal time since you basically work all day every day with only a 30 min lunch break. I also feel that the compensation is very low for the type of work that I do there. I have a college degree and I am making the same amount of money that I did in high school! I can barely afford to live.
good,"After clocking in I assisted in catching up the queue, Doctor calls, prescription processing, kept my area as well as others neat and organized."
good,Cvs is a ok place to work if you need temporary employment but your work hours are not guaranteed and the lack of benefits makes it a a ok job
good,"- Handled cash register transactions, opening and closing of register and cash counting"
good,"i enjoyed more working for longs. i loved my co-employees.we had very good team.I learned a lot about different insurances.we delt with special clinic patients,which had there own formulary.we did flu shots.the hardest part of the job was not having enough time to give excellent service to our customers."
good,I have learned to work on a fast pace working line. I have to scan tickets which will light up lights underneath the products with a number of how many i have to pick. When i finish picking my tote i close it and put it on the line. The job its self isn't a bad job you are always busy and moving witch is a wonderful way to pass the work day . The hardest part of my job would be not knowing how long our days are going to be. I never know if i am working 8 hours 10 hours and at some points we have had to work 11 hours witch would be fine if i would have prior notice to doing so.
good,"Pulling Claim results (Medicare) from Xcel pivot tables, on reports. Follow-up on BFP and BFD Medicare, by researching modifier usage, and AON signage from patient."
good,"Fun place, great customers, interesting atmosphere, learned to listen more"
good,"by the book in most cases. advancement is possible by rare. two break rooms, catering in main break room with deck attached."
good,this company offers on-site training for a very complex billing procedure.
good,it was a good place to work but management was horrible. there was a new manager every few months and the supervisors did not get involved enough in the actual store work environment.
good,"Nice entry-level position for individuals seeking a career as a certified pharmacy tech because CVS will provide training, as well as sponsor you for certification exam. The flexible hours and opportunities to pick-up hours at other locations was nice, especially as a full-time student."
good,Company structure extremely tight. Culture of company not known or understood.
good,"Overall the job was incredibly easy and low stress. The general manager however was not easy to work with. I went above and beyond to cover shifts for other employees but when I asked to not be scheduled for 10 hours shifts because my back can not take it, the general manager brushed it off. The final straw was when the general manager asked if I could cover a shift for someone and I said only if they cover a shift for me and all he said was “forget it”"
good,"I work with someone who constantly calls me names and makes mean jokes. They have a high turnover rate, no one is reprimanded they are just cut in hours or moved to another store."
good,Typical Pharmacy.  Under staffed.  Typical national chain.  Equipment needs updating as does a lot of company procedures and practices.  Need to review total compensation packages to be more competitive.
good,Fast passed and challenging. Flexible schedule for students. A great introduction to the health system for those who seek experience in it.
good,"You will not move up in the company quickly, it takes YEARS! Becoming full time is impossible. Don't expect a flexible schedule depends on the manager"
good,"Constant stress.  Chairs not allowed.  Moving as fast as you can from the beginning to end of shift. Constantly being told that we will be ""dinged"" for not doing something.Constant fear of write-ups. Higher mgmt doesn't care what happens on the store level.  Store mgmt allowed to scream and  cuss at other employees in front of customers.  Definitely not what I expected."
good,"Healthy Choice cafe, with specials ever day. The Mail department was fun to work with,They took the time and patience to make sure you are comfortable in your position,  diverse and understanding, the other departments were very judgmental and uncomfortable to work with, with limited training, they expected more from you than you were trained and  reluctant to help. They only hire through Temp agencies and you need to wait to see if your contract will be renewed every month."
good,"Pay and benefits are fair, but work/life balance is nonexistent.  As amount of hours and employees are taken from stores, the amount of required task are increasing."
good,"They know they offer great benefits working from home which creates flexibility.  However advancement is very difficult, overall lack of recognition and compensation based on time needed to complete tasks at hand"
good,"A typical day at work is 1 cashier and 1 manager/supervisor for 8 hrs. You process transactions from customers and vendors, which is somewhat difficult depending how busy the store is. The hardest part of the job was dealing with outdated computer systems (registers, photo printing, money orders) that tend to glitch often, causing customers to be frustrated and not having enough personnel for a shift."
good,"regardless of the amount of hours you are working you get no breaks, lunchtime or any time for personal space. ""it's too busy to do so"" "
good,"Basic call center. Lots of mandatory OT, especially in January. Decent time off but you work weekends and all holidays. Management is okay but Corporate sees you as a number not a person."
good,"Average company to work for. Compensation is decent, depending on the location you work in the employees are okay. Benefits are good. Hardly any room for advancement and most stores are very selfish with their employees so don’t try to transfer unless you’re leaving the state."
good,A typical day at work is greeting customers and a lot of customer service.The most enjoyable part was making new friends and helping others feel better when delivering medications.
good,I joined the company as a full time front store associate in April. I have worked at 3 different locations and can honestly say I wish I would've stayed at my original store. Like any job it has its difficulties but this company has a big issue with miscommunication- from HR down to store associates. Issues of worker safety aren't taken seriously until someone is physically harmed and a lot of action taken is done so re-actively instead of pro-actively. Would do thorough evaluating before agreeing to work here. Its definitely not a job for everyone.
good,"I don’t really have a review I’ve worked here for over a year it’s a cool place, wish there was more diversity and appreciation for each other. Not an easy job when people can’t communicate"
good,Gives a chance to grow and learn in medical field. Helps you work with patients. You get a chance to be exposed to different medications and therapies.
good,"A very busy nonstop pharmacy. days go by quickly. could use more help. more hours from corp. patients are awesome people, one reason why I like it in north east."
good,my only gripe about the company was really a really sad pay increase when i was promoted I went from making 15.85 an hr as a shift supervisor to getting offered an operations manager position and only being offered .13 cents more an hour being told that was the maximum amount I could be offered for the area so when the store was further away from my home and for only .13 cents more a hr I had to leave the maximum for my area is 21.00 an hr for that position and I was told it would have only been 15.98 and for someone who was basically doing the work of an assistant manager or store manager in training as they call it a SMIT and doing extra work at every point I was called on going and setting up 6 new stores doing planno-grams other shift supervisors weren't capable of doing on my days off it wasn't a fair evaluation of my abilities or work I had put in over my years with the company so I left for a better opportunity on good terms after 2 weeks notice.
good,"Working at CVS was often enjoyable, however, it was clear there were issues in the upper levels of management. Often, differing goals would be communicated from different individuals."
good,when I first got there they were talking about how much room there is for growth but I think it’s because everyone had already been promoted within the first two years of that building opening and expanding so there really wasn’t any more room for growth and they weren’t creating any more opportunities management is really bad theyre unorganized and they never seem to stick around and they play favoritism around
good,"It definitely wasn't my thing to be at a cash register all day. Shifts seemed so long. If you want to be active and control stock and inventory, apply to CVS. Just wasn't my thing to do those things as well as being a cashier."
good,"They have a large base of India workers that took the USA jobs.  The manager is a great guy, his Team Leader lady is very mean and evil.  All n All the facility is wonderful!!!"
good,Loved working for the company great benefits and very flexible with hours. How ever the coworkers and the pharmacists could use sone attitude redirection
good,"in general, cvs only cares about getting the job done.  If it can be accomplished with less employees and tech hours the better.  the workload far exceeds the capabilities of the number of persons on schedule to complete them in a timely manner"
good,"Most stores are run with limited payroll budgets, which leads to many skeleton shifts and not enough people to correctly assist customers. Also not enough time to finish the tasks that need to be done."
good,It’s very busy and we don’t have enough help. I feel we dont get paid enough for everything we do. It is very fast pace and hard to keep up without enough help
good,"The Pharmacy was faced paced as are most, it was typical. Co-workers were great, compliant and ethical. I would recommend it to anyone considering their Pharmacy for employment"
good,Micro managing. the most harassing company to its customers. Unnecessary call duties. Poorly managed. Very understaffed. Not willing to pay what you are worth.
good,"I have been with CVS Health for 6 years now.  I have never truly enjoyed the job but there were positions I have held that were tolerable. The bottom line is the company can and will move you around from department to department and you have will zero say in the position that you hold unless you decide to leave the company. I have been in 6 different positions. Some that I was promoted to but my most recent position was not my choice and I hate it. I will be leaving the company due to the lack of appreciation for tenured reps who have years of knowledge and experience. "
good,"Getting hired without knowing someone can be challenging. Upper management struggles to support their employees and refuses accountability for their decisions, often throwing underlings under the bus."
good,"It was good working at CVS. Relatively fast paced, even if they want to make you think otherwise. Truck comes weekly and truck day changes every time there’s a holiday."
good,"Store manager position is a challenging one, like most manager positions in retail. However, for retail, this is an ok job. 45 hour a week minimum. Bad work/life balance. Clientele is good and most customers are pleasant to be around. If your District Leader is poor or your pharmacy manager is poor (or both), then it will be almost an impossible situation. Also, company can not decide what it wants to be. It will do one thing that makes you think that the retail part will be around as forever, then do something else that makes you think they won't be involved in retail 5 years from now."
good,"I liked the job, however, it was tedious and stressful because I didn't get enough hours, therefore I wasn't getting paid enough. The best part for me was interacting with people every day; I'm a people person and I enjoy customer service."
good,Started out before company opened. Moved to receiving office where the work was impossible to keep up with.  Receivers didn't count correctly and very rarely paperwork matched purchase order. Had been working about 50 hrs. wk. when supervisor from NJ came in and told me I would be starting at 6 AM instead of the 7 AM that I had enough trouble getting to.
good,Everything is timed therefore it is always busy. Not a good place to work in if you don't have enough patience. I enjoyed the relationships I created with patients.
good,Long hours very busy always had something to do treated you decent but don't give a choice on over time you gotta do it only flaw very understanding would work there again
good,Stressful and fast-paced. Overtime is mandatory. May be a week of 10-hour days. Poor management. Does not adequately train. Hard to schedule vacations and time off.
good,"interesting to see a new 2019 LP position posted that involves someone needing to shadow drug deliveries cradle to grave, but perhaps not so much considering the expired load of insulin that was brought in from the yard by the RX manager last year, received and then shipped out of the distribution facility to pharmacies (can you say BUSTED?) , resulting in the loss of multiple management jobs adding up to more than 60 years of tenure ."
good,"For the most part, I think it's a good company, very helpful staff,  lots of overtime available, provide food sometimes when they need more people for overtime, aknowledgement when you do well. Also very stressfull, fast paced, lots of monitoring, down to the minute. Call monitoring etc. Get 2 15 min breaks and 1/2 hr lunch. , Not a living wage in this area if your single and live alone."
good,It’s ok if you are really in need of a job. The work they put you through doesn’t match the pay rate. The management team/ employees are security. You have to be full time to get all the benefits even after your 90 days or have a certain amount of hrs. I worked well over those hrs & still haven’t got the full benefits. The store manager is awesome i can say that..
good,"Management has high expectations for an unrealistic time frame to get task done. Too much workload for employees and understaffed, underpaid. End up working overtime and no time for friends and family. They want you to take care of the patients and not work overtime, but with constant pressure, interupptions it is virtually impossible. Management says the impossible can be possible. Untrue when you have 3 pharmacy techs and 3 pharmacist. And their intake people of 2 to 3 people  are constantly adding new referrals to our workload. Hard to keep up."
good,"Generally, the work day has both it slow and high intensity periods. Management tries to work hard with staff but to an extent. Something I didn't expect is the fact you can request more hours at different stores when you are not working at your home store."
good,"Very high volume location. Pharmacists are your managers but their managers would come in all the time and disrupt work flow and create tension. They would demand that a tech do all of the aspects of a Lead Tech without title or compensation. Employees who could not do the tech job they were hired for were relegated to cashier. Therefore, the other techs had to cover for them with the register as well as the work flow they should have been helping with. There is a high turnover rate."
good,Work life balance is non-existent for many on PBM side. Pay is okay but the work from home and flexible hours are helpful. Health insurance options are terrible and horribly expensive for the employees
good,Overall great place to work! fast-paced and energetic team players on the flood make it an awesome time!  Downside was strict attendance policy and not flexible enough for those with continued medical appointments without last minute management interventions.
good,There is not enough associate during a shift . Too many shop lifters. They have only 2 closers at night and it’s usually 2 females. It’s not very safe.
good,it was just a regular job. Sometimes understaffed. It could be really annoying. Sometimes there are no hours for people. I do my best at the job. But sometimes it’s difficult to pull off a great performance if I’m all alone.
good,"Upper management never listens to how short staffed we are. They come smiling at us informing our store level management that to ""Optimize"" workflow we will have our hours cut regardless of how busy we actually are.."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and hectic.  There is always something to do, or someone to help .I learned all I know about pharmacy from CVS.  I had a great supervisor that taught me alot. She helped me in my roles at cvs and in turn I worked my way up to inventory specialist.  If you like to work fast, help people, have a lot of responsibilities,  you can think fast on your feet, you love to multitask this is the perfect job for you."
good,CVS Health overall is a great company to work for! The job itself is for someone who is very stern and focused on the job at hand. Minimize distractions with colleagues because gossip is common in the call center. Please get used to constant change on a daily to weekly basis.
good,"CVS had a very good training program, and will help make you a very efficient pharmacy technician. However, you often have to lie to customers about wait times, etc. in order to fulfill survey requirements. Very corporate and not much compensation for amount of work."
good,"I enjoyed working with some of my coworkers, but I really found the job mundane and I didn't really learn anything there. I felt like it was a  dead end job that didn't work to advance my career goals."
good,"Do not work at Bob Hope location "
good,. Management sucks!!!!!  They talk so bad about you and don’t really care about what’s going on. They only care about making money and don’t care about the employees.
good,"This job requires quick multitask hills, along with very quick hands. USB able to use a lot of common sense in deal with different types of individuals. It is also a job that you need to learn to do things on your own, and solve problems on your own."
good,management is the worse. greet co workers and they suck with trainings. if you want a life or have kids that needs your attention doing the day this job is not for you. management shows favoritism and racism.
good,If you have a great work crew to work with you then you can possibly love this job at this place but if you don't have a good work crew and have to deal with all the stress that comes with this job then you would not last long here you would definitely want to find something else
good,"CVS Health does not value the ""little people"" as far as employees. They are all about the money and saving money, whether that is a sacrifice to the employees or not, they don't care."
good,"Most retail positions aren't the greatest, and this one definitely has it's downsides, but I think there are more opportunities for advancement than in other places I've worked. There are also many opportunities to improve your abilities to work with different people, and to learn different management styles. The team you work with has a major impact on the quality of the culture, and I know my location was significantly different from most, but we all grew together and functioned well until there were major management changes. There is a significant amount of nepotism within my district, ad the recent changes certainly reflect that. This is my primary reason for moving on from the company, since I have otherwise been treated very well here."
good,There was no room for advancement. Overstaffed and employees did not have enough work to fill a whole day. Managers fought and did not manage their employees well.
good,retail pharmacy can be extremely stressful ONLY because the staff is underpaid and overworked. Extremely understaffed. One tech or one pharmacist is doing the work of 3 people. Also being a tech is very competitive in retail. Not everyone is doing the same job. The fastest tech gets to do production while everyone else does register and phones
good,"cvs does not care about their employees mental health or well being,, they are constantly overworking their pharmacists and technicians and making our lives so much more difficult. there should always be at least 2 techs and 1 rph on duty at all pharmacies no matter what. my pharmacy MAKES DO. with just me working with 1 rph doing thr work of 3 people and recently they cut my hours from working 40 hrs a week to 20 hrs a week TOTAL TECHNICIAN HRS. which includes me and 2 other techs that are on the payroll.since i am lead tech i got the full 20 hrs and the other techs were cut from the schedule, a pharmacist should NEVER have to work by themselves i dont care how many hours cvs tells us to cut it should never happen, in the hrs that they cut to save some money or give some CEO a bonus, they lost even more money with customers that transferred out because of long wait times, and SO many pharmacy duties that just cannot be done in merely 4 hrs a day. its pathetic. and the district manager and whatever other regional managers just told us....deal with it. its not a good place to work for stability or flexibility, and after working there for over a certain period of time your pay maxes out and there is no room for any more raises/bonuses. they do match 401k but i have heard their health insurance is not good either...i wouldnt know because instead of averaging your total amount of hours every SIX months to see if you work over 30 hrs and can be considered full time they check your hours once a year. so since i was hired 1 month after they do this averaging of your hours, i have been"
good,"poor unprofessional management, no room for growth, do not care about family emergencies or when calling out sick. Did start at good pay and benefits."
good,Pay for a certified pharmacy technician is very low compared to independent pharmacies. Upper management does not help with any advancement within the company or compensation.
good,A typical day at work consisted of sitting in a cube and taking care of Medicare insurance prior authorizations.  Breaks were schedule and in about 2 hour intervals with 1/2 hour unpaid lunch.
good,"well it was a places of get inland get out,cuse no one will like to take the time to talk to u for ah second,cuse u got to get rest for the next day, more over no time."
good,"It’s tough because the hours do vary and it tends to be tough to move up within the company. The next tough area is the physical demands. You have to be able to stand hours on end both in the pharmacy and on the sales floor. You will need to be able to lift 80lbs and up, the totes for trucks and overstock tend to be over filled. "
good,CVS was a good employer. With all retailers hours vs tasks and customer service ratio was a definite issue. Managers had to choose RX over Front store help when a problem arose in RX and customers in the front were put on the back burner. CVS didn't really care about their front stores as long as RX was making the money for the store.
good,"Fun place to work, ability to learn new things about the pharmaceutical industry,  can be frustrating at times with the lack of maturity among the management team, also not very competitive when it comes to compensation"
good,Right now with tech hours cut the pharmacist are being spread thin and expected to do everything while maintaining metric numbers. The techs are stressed due to lack of help in the pharmacy and the pharmacist are the same but have the pressure of filling prescriptions quickly but these cuts compromised patient safety.
good,"Years ago it was a great place to work. "
good,"I work with well trained great people, but unfortunately the company has cost hours when we need them the most.  I'm a lead tech and there isn't enough time to complete my other tasks."
good,"I work as Lead Visual design Cognizant consultant at CVS since August 2018, Here is my working experience about CVS,"
good,Overall CVS has been a decent company to work for but with recent moves such as mergers at the executive level it sees as if they are trying to finance these activities by cutting hours and causing the quality of customer service to not be what is once was.
good,"Poor communication with management."
good,This would be a good place to work if they cared about there employees as much as they cared for the so-called well being of their patients. Do better
good,The manager made my experience not fun at all she was very rude. She would yell at employees for no reason and talk bad about them trying to lower there self-esteem.
good,CVS is focused on the bottom line than customers.  You're hired to advance and learn but outside people are brought in to change the culture.  But the existing management loses interest to advancement Opportunites taken away.
good,"Learned a lot"
good,Its Hard to Balance your Work life and Personal Life with the job being that some Stores will always need Back up or Help in the Pharmacy due to others constantly calling out.
good,I would pull emails for patients that are  getting their prescriptions mail order. Would input this  information into the system. Also  was a  team lead for many. Assisting new employees with how to log in and pull emails  from different locations for the patient to be enrolled. I also worked on special projects for the manager at the time.
good,I worked there for over 12 years in 3 different states and ll 3 seemed liked I worked at a different company with each state.   Consistency and engagement are key components that CVS lacks but overall it really depended on who your immediate manager was.
good,"Very fast paced environment, acquired much information about how the company runs. management was fairly poor, spread thin. not enough leadership roles to address the volume or workers. Culture in the workplace needs great improvement, felt like a number opposed to a valuable worker."
good,"I loved this job and my co-workers, especially my boss.  After 40 years of service my boss was fired for theft, only thing was, he didn't steal, I personally rang him up, and he had his receipt.  After backing him up, they still fired him for opening a soda while in line to pay.  Still theft in their eyes.  I honestly believe it was a force out, you can hire 2  mangers for the price of one.  We were the number 1 store in the district.  I am absolutely positive that because I backed him up, I was on my way out too.  I saw a supervisor position ad placed the day after I backed him,(no need for another)  I went from 38 hours a week down to 28 the week after.  I ended up quitting before being fired, as I was 100% positive I was out the door."
good,I worked midnights as a CVS pharmacist and was a part of the company gaining a consideralble share of the market due to the availability of pharmacy services. I definitely lioved the customers at CVS. The workplace culture was not good. The company was not culture friendly in terms of excluding some employees from advancement.
good,"I had skills beyond the level of the position that i held and i was not able to apply for other positions due to the fact that i was a contracted employee,  despite the the fact that I had discussed my interests with my manager, so i  left the company after my contract completed."
good,"I had an excellent staff. We were able to earn a very high bonus. We had an excellent customer base and enjoyed very much serving the community. Excellent store in Gaffney, SC."
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician was not a very challenging job when we were fully staffed and people stopped quitting. The downfall to this job are the customers. Most of the time you are dealing with angry addicts or people coming in with fake prescriptions. It is a rather dangerous job. I've had people come in spilling their blood everywhere, people threaten me and reach across the counter at me, I've had men stalk me online because they see me in the pharmacy. They should really have protective class in their pharmacy because I just did not feel safe. The emotional toll is what I would worry about most if you are thinking about getting a job in a CVS pharmacy especially at this location."
good,"Overworked, stressed, lack of support, poor hiring structure, no fun, leave most days with a headache, boss is just a face, he is no help, need more tech hours"
good,I have never worked with an actual pharmacist or technician that I didn't enjoy working with at the store level. Corporate policies are impractical and the company is cutting hours while in its largest period of growth. It makes the actual work stressful at times. But the teams I have worked with are great.
good,"In all it is a good place to work , the manager is extremely helpful and encouraging . The work is the Extremely easy just a lot of changes going on with the company that are not beneficial to employees ."
good,"It is a stressful o=work environment, they also pay you below average for certified pharmacy technicians. For the amount of work that is being done, we are short staffed and then we get points taken off because we couldn't finish all the jobs required of us."
good,"CVS is definitely driven by their share holders. The employees are expected to be available at anytime; however, because you can work remotely there is a bit more flexible then normal. It is a stressful environment but great for a problem solver."
good,Very stressful environment not enough help expected to do the work of 4/5 techs because they wont hire more help.pharmacist in charge is not friendly and not helpful
good,"Everything in there is not everything , they do stuff that benefits boses,not wrker.they paid,but they dont,think of wrker fillings.given us mandatory on our off days,its killing."
good,"Very forceful corporate leaders, expectations set very high with recent staffing cuts. Good technicians stretched very thin while poor/mediocre techs have no opportunity to learn or be properly trained to become better because of workload."
good,My experience working for CVS was not great. I worked for a pharmacist that was on an ego trip. When I got pregnant she made up excuses to fire me until finally I just quit.
good,I really enjoyed going to work everyday to see my co-workers in 2 different stores but corporate policies and procedures arae very bad towards employees. All focused on the almight dollar in their pocket and patient care or compensation based on performance for employees. The largest raise achievable is a 2% raise which in most cases is not even 0.50 cents per hour no matter how hard you work for them.
good,"Not really a preferable job for a long running career but not a bad option for someone either in High School/College, or interested in pursuing a job in the medical field."
good,"This job was very hard. Pharmacists had to fill orders, answer phones, ring up customers, work the drive thru window while having minimal staff. Cvs is open for all major holidays and you worked every other weekend minimally. Sometimes you have to work 3 or 4 weekends per month if coverage can't be found."
good,"Long hours, yet overtime not allowed while simultaneously understaffed. Hours are cut every quarter, it seems. I never got the pay I was promised. Depending on the pharmacy crew, it can make or break your experience. I had a wonderful team, just like a family. Corporate sees numbers, not people."
good,Fun to work with most of the co-workers. For the most part we all get along. Their are several new people who think they know more than us senior workers who have been with the company a heck of a lot longer than them.
good,"The day is go, go, go. Tasks are timed and monitored if they are completed in the designated time frame. Metrics are a driving force. Often times I stand in the same place for 12 hours, due to how the workflow is set up. Majority of the time there is sufficient support staff to assist with day to day. The company touts they are patient-focused however it's the bottom line that drives their decisions."
good,"I have worked at CVS for 12 years. Every year our targets increase and our staff hours decrease. We are continually asked to do more with less. When he suggest you don’t have enough help, you’re told you’re just not doing it right"
good,"Workplace is quiet. "
good,The job is great as long as you can be a robot and have no personality. Managers are either really on top of there game or most times they will just bark orders while they set in the office.
good,As a Senior CCR your job changes every week.. Sometimes multiple times per week. Management could never seem to make up their minds with changes. I saw amazing employees leave because they were frustrated with the direction the company was going.
good,Job was demanding and extremely stressful and they were very unwilling to work with anybody that was pregnant due to the job requirements having to be divided up on other team members which caused a huge stressful environment.
good,"Takes a toll on your body standing up all the time, supervisors don't care about your well being and customers are often hard to deal with. Great to learn about pharmacy but nothing else."
good,"it is a retail job, so as long as you know what to expect with any retail job, you won't be surprised."
good,A typical day at CVS is ok.  Its very hard to apply for other positions in a call center as politics plays a major role.  They do not look at your credentials you have and what you can do to advance
good,Working at my store location was great a times. I would go and help at other stores and they had lack of leadership and management support. What I didn't like was supervisors would tell you one thing and completey do the opposite.
good,In at 5:30 am to do cycle counts. Start restocking by 7:00 pm after that receive truck for Mckesson and UPS and FedEx by 8:30 scan to carts and then put in locations fridges or shelves.By 1:30 pm start restocking for end of day.
good,"Good environement to learn basic functions of pharmacy, but the amount of work we do is not compensated enough by hourly pay. Management needs to address immediate staffing issues and needs to train technicians as fast as possible so as to not disrupt the work flow"
good,Staff at this organization is great for the most part; but also you have the continuous customer service that you have to provide. Regardless of how the customer reacts to  what you tell you have to take an even do it with a smile. Which can be hard at times deal with people. Very fast paced at sometimes plus missing any days can cause for you to lose hours or days for the following week. Pay not great at all this is a love hate type of job.
good,"Not enough hours given for pharmacy staff to effectively/efficiently get work done. Extremely fast paced environment, which can be dangerous when there is no overlapping pharmacist to help with the work load"
good,A constant flow of customers each evening in and out of the store. The co workers are very pleasant to work with and assist as a team if necessary. Do not see Head of Management often enough each week to discuss changes in schedule or policy. I do not get enough hours each week to sustain a living or to pay for health Insurance monthly. To many workers not enough hours to share with each worker. I love the customers especially the Elderly. The job gives me the feeling I have assisted/helped some sickly person. I want to feel my work has helped someone.
good,"My overall opinion is that if the company allowed for more autonomy, they would see overall better results. People need to feel like they can make their own decisions for what's best for their team. Unfortunately, that culture doesn't exist here."
good,"When I worked for CVS Health, the District Manager for the pharmacy was not helpful in transferring me to another store, so I can move up in the company to another position. I made a side step to inventory specialist with a lot more responsibilities; there were no benefits that were included."
good,Good company for job security but they don’t compensate well. Some departments offer work at home but the Work life balance can be tough. There is room for growth within the company but not every manager embraces your leave.
good,"This job would be better if it weren't for the location, clientele, and approach to management. Our store is located in a poor neighborhood and is often the target of shrinkage.  Liquor is one of our highest shrinkage items.  The store has been robbed several times during my two year employ with the company, once at gunpoint, and is a frequent stop for people looking for over-the-counter needles.  As a result of the store's demographic, management takes a very hands-off approach.  Security is at a minimum for being a 24 hour store."
good,The company is ok to work for. Not enough staff hours and too much work. If you have a good manager things go better as in any work place. Benefits are horrible.
good,"Working in Retail requires a lot and salaries are too low. The Over turn rate is high. Unable to maintain technicians, because of lack of advancement."
good,"Great Teamwork. Substitute Pharmacist are sometimes not suitable for the job. Great to help customers and make them feel better, BUT some CANNOT be helped and you watch them get weaker and weaker."
good,"Very fast paste Pharmacy, you have to learn and pick up on the rotation quikly, dealing with different attitude, make sure you know your knowledge of medical termin. your class of drugs, make sure patients have consultation with pharmacist.."
good,This company is not really a bad place to work but the compensation is a disgrace. Unless you have someone else sharing the cost of living with you you will struggle financially working here. They don't keep up with other call center pay scale and the turn around rate is ridiculous. This company should only be used to gain experience and move on. Oh by the way...Expect mandatory work on New Years Eve and New Years Day..Good luck.
good,Pharmacy is understaffed majority of the time. Technicians are poorly trained for the job so most don't know what to do which leads to more experienced techs doing more work but not being compensated for doing extra work. Promotions take forever to complete. Most pharmacies are in need of help so there's opportunity to pick up shifts if you aren't getting enough hours at your home store that's a plus because they cut hours all the time so its nice to be able to make up for it at another store. It's hard to get a full-time position here so I would say it's better for students looking for a little extra income.
good,The work itself isn't tough but dealing with the customers isn't worth the amount we are paid. Needs to raise starting pay to $12.00. Leaving the retail pharmacy soon.
good,"Be ready to work the job of 2 people! Love working at CVS,BUT they will not get rid of people who call in continually and it makes it hard on everyone else."
good,Here recently at CVS-Omnicare the hours are going to be cut for the hourly associates.  They have already not replaced vacated positions and just tell management they have to figure out how to get the jobs done.  With our focus supposed to be on servicing the patients who cannot help themselves this does not lend to a positive work environment.
good,"The job as a order picker is competitive and designed for max efficiency for the company; obviously. What doesn't come into account for this company is the stress put on the employees to make the demands for the companies production. Small work place, creates conflict between employees, if the employee doesn't make their production numbers they will be disciplined or fired."
good,CVS is a highly stressful environment to work for.  You don't get paid nearly enough for everything you have to deal with or actually have to accomplish in a shift.
good,You can sit in a chair and be yelled at for 8 hours by drug addicts or you can't. This job is not for everyone though anyone can do it. I don't suggest this job if you're prone to being very emotional in the workplace.
good,"Worked in multiple locations throughout Maryland. Some teams were great, some teams were difficult and required more time. Pharmacists worked hard but were too stressed to meet customers' and managers' expectations limiting interactions with team and leading to burnout. The system CVS utilizes is by far the greatest I have seen compared to other companies. It truly makes a huge difference to have such great software that does the job for you. "
good,A large company but does not provide the type of benefits to their employees that this size of company should provide. The company often requires long hours during holiday season but does nothing to compensate for that time.
good,"great co-workers and amazing management team, fun work environment, not very good pay or hours. wanted full-time position but never got 40 hours, yearly raise was 0.15 cents"
good,stressful enviornment and work life balance is not that great. The chances of progressing to the next level are not that great you would have to be friends with one of the people from management.
good,ok company to work for the pay and benefits were really good you had good amount of time a bit of a commute depending on where you are coming from in the valley
good,"The pharmacies I floated to around the Houston, TX area filled over a thousand prescriptions a day.Everything was times, including how many minutes were spent on calls to doctors or talking to customers, The time it took to fill a prescriptions was also timed."
good,It was okay working for them. There wasn't  much teamwork  and the break room was always messy. The pay could have been better especially since they're  the number  one pharmacy  in the world.
good,"typical day of work consist of making coolers for orders, picking orders for patients, entering orders in on computer for courier service and ups. Clean area end of shift. I have learned a lot in the medical and dealing with patients and talking to patients. The company is small so I see the same coworkers daily and we have good relationships. Management is not too good. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with my coworkers."
good,"Theres definitely some pros and some cons. Its not all bad but there are a lot of things that come with retail pharmacy that takes away from your responsibilities as a pharm tech and makes you feel more like a fast food cashier at times. I feel that compared to our retail competitors, techs at cvs are paid less and the workload is more."
good,"A lot of unpleasant surprises from headquarters : constantly cutting hours, doing 5 people job but getting paid for 1, unfair pay  and treatment from bosses and some customers. "
good,Decent job if you're looking for something to pass time. There are opportunities to advance into the pharmacy if you so desire and they pay for your training.
good,"Management was non existent, they seldom wanted to help with any issues. Would always be referred to ""team leads"" to help with escalations. Too many chefs in the kitchen, but no one to help with the guests. "
good,"The hours are flexible. Enjoyed working with my team, they are what makes the company great. Would like better compensation and opportunities to advance."
good,It's a make or break company so you'll either learn the information an advance or you'll realize it's not the job for you. You are in a fast paced environment learning the drugs as well as billing system for insurance and trying to make sure customer has excellent experience
good,"The management  was in his office most days, co workers taught me the ropes, I restocked the selves, helped customers find what they needed and did what I was told."
good,"this workplace environment is not meant for anyone. I work at the store in Anderson, sc and transferred the store in Greenwood, sc."
good,I'm currently looking for a job that will allow me to utilize my talents instead of having them wasted. Growth within the company is also my ideal job.
good,"i was hired after cvs purchased target pharmacy, i already made more than cvs pays their technicians, i can never get a raise at my current position even though they add responsibilities almost daily"
good,"The company hires you and tells you that your schedule is 8 hours Monday through Friday, but after your first 2 weeks your schedule goes to mandatory 10 hour days and this may include weekends. The departments are extremely fast-paced. You only get 1 week to train. The hardest part of the job is that no matter how hard you work, or how great your attendance is, if you miss your rate even 1 day it brings down all the work productivity for the week and then you're put on a written disciplinary action that will last 9 months. There is very little room for promotion just department switching. The most enjoyable part of the job is every 3 months the company buys the building lunch. (Usually 2 slices of pizza and a soda)"
good,"Starting as an account coordinator, there was very little training to get me up to speed with the current needs for the job. There was a lot of needing to figure it out on your own. In addition to this, there was a disconnect with management and very little feedback which let me know how I was doing. The work days included fair scheduling and adequate time to get projects done. I did learn new systems and coordination across business units. The culture at the main office was very corporate and hardly any inter-department activities. I enjoyed being in an environment which wasn't really structured, but at the same time it was difficult to find the ultimate goals for the company."
good,High stress job with management who couldn't care less about you. They were only worried about their own bonus and making numbers and didn't matter at what cost.  Terminate people over dumb stuff. Don't properly staff stores. Provide very few staff hours therefore tons of work falls on RPh
good,It's different in every state they go by different standards instead of following the same standard set forth by the company Great customers but hard to keep up with demand many roles for one technician
good,"They change direction every year and use massive layoffs to do it.  Little to no communication during transitions, no teamwork.  Too many politics.  No job security."
good,The store I worked at is  a pretty busy store and most times we only had 4 techs all day when I first started we had  10 techs but slowly they all left
good,"As a pharmacist, I was assigned to a task that was truly could be handled by a technician, except for the law. My hours were only in the evening. The management was very minimal. The workplace culture seemed to be of many disgruntled  employees."
good,"CVS is a good stepping stone if you want to get into retail. Very busy gives you a  lot of experience"
good,"The other people in the store, pharmacist, techs and front store make it worth showing up for work.Management outside of store makes you want to quit."
good,"I started working for them expecting a fast-paced and exciting environment to work in, but ended up with less hours than promised and very few opportunities for advancement."
good,"Very busy at times. Usually only two people working front store.  Was expected to do other jobs that involved being away from front counter, but required to make sure no customers were waiting and no shoplifting occurred. Difficult to do to it al and get the work done."
good,Great place to work if you're just looking for a job. The atmosphere is extremely casual and relaxed with little potential for long-term growth and success.
good,"Very productive. Volume is normally high and you will work some hours and weekends to try and attempt to zero the volume out. The breaks total to an hour, even when working 12 hours. there is a ping pong table in the break room."
good,"Great to keep you busy, you can't get bored when there is always something to be done, but it doesn't help morale to never feel you completely accomplish what you were supposed to with 100% facing, out dates, etc."
good,This is not a great paying job unless you can hold out 10 years. It is mainly designed to be entry level positions. The wages are low and benefits are accordingly.
good,If your applying to CVS HAVE A PLAN for the future. Not a company that offers growth or pays well for the amount of work you do at all. You can't make a CAREER getting 10-13 dollars working with medication which techs are severely UNDERPAID. You meet amazing people but ask yourself are people paying your bills or is your job. Have a plan.
good,This department has no idea how to set up a long term department and it shows in managements inability to make decisions. The work is repetitive and depressing.
good,"Worked there in High school and college, there are some places that would pay you better to get you through school and also work better with you hours that you would need to work."
good,fast paced work environment  has good reputation.  but like to hire and advance outside of the company instead of promoting within.  was there and was promised advancement and was denied everytime due to hiring of outside source.
good,"A Typical Day-Review Accommodation requests with Employee"
good,CVS is a good place to learn the basics of what it means to be a technician. My coworkers are nice and so is my boss. But she doesn't have any real say in the company policy the way customers think. They pay you very little to do the amount of work you do. It would be different if the Pharmacist wasn't getting paid 5 to 6 times as much as I make.
good,"Great place to get experience in the pharmacy department but low pay. The system needs and upgrade, and everything is either broken or old. Also the benefits are not so good."
good,Specialty management has gotten worse over the past year. Not a good department to work in. CVS as a company is a good company to work for but the department i was in was not.
good,The management was good and you were always busy working at CVS.  You were always on your feet and customers were the number one priority while working at the store.
good,I have worked with CVS for 11 and 1/2 years. I have seen the good side that transitioned into the micromanaged. Understaffed and management not so good
good,No work life balance................................................................................................................................... you work long hours with minimum help. Labor budgets are too low for the amount of work required causing salaried Manager to work double the hours you are paid for. Some Dm's require you to work on your scheduled days off in order to fulfil workload requirements.
good,"It really depends on the locations of the store and the store manager. If the store is located in a bad neighborhood, most likely the company won't care about you or the way the store looks. Hours are given to the store based on their budget, which means if you're store doesn't make a lot of money then you won't get the hours you need. The company has high expectations but then they don't give you the hours you need to meet those set standards. You always have customers yelling at you just so they get get their way."
good,"Free coffee,tea, and chocolate is provided. Not a lot to learn since it is a standard operating system. Very repetitive and less dynamism in workflow processes."
good,A typical day at work would be very fast paced and always helping people on their path to better health. The hardest part of the job is staying up to pace and not  being behind. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the people and helping them understand the purpose of all their medications
good,"very busy billing office with very high expectation.  The company did not offer many perks with company function, special days or team building tools.  The training was limited."
good,"You would cover the register, stock shelves, answer phone calls, take passport pictures and assist on photo machine.  I had to do the Hallmark isles, so when the register was busy i had to run back and forth to help out.  Was never given enough time to finish putting out inventory or placing orders twice a week."
good,"Working for finance means: no work life balance, no flexibility for working from home. A company that is not investing in training and people development. Poor diversity for managers/ leadership, 80% are men with no people skills."
good,"Hard days, high volume, and high stress.  Well payed for the job i was doing.  My manager was incredible and always looked out for me but alot of people in the company do not care."
good,"how all the health/benefits get processed and mailed, the drive was far, but enjoyed working there, hours were perfect, learned new machines and the experience was awesome."
good,"Nurse practitioners skills are wasted on doing clerical, administrative work that is an under use of their professional talent and skills.  The practitioner is the only one in the clinic, so they are isolated and dependent on the phone to reach out to the manager, colleague or overseeing physician."
good,Loved my coworkers but didn't like working for the company. Very bad balance of customer/employee satisfaction. Unrealistic expectations placed on all locations.
good,"This is a good company to work for, if you don't want to change the position you were hired for. It is very difficult to move up in this company. I would recommend this job for people who are looking for a short term position."
good,I was a working mother at the time and the flexibility was ideal for me. I had a manger  when I started that encouraged me to get my CPHT and made me a lead technician
good,"Working at CVS pharmacy was stressful yet worth the stress. Working at CVS pharmacy, you'll learn a lot pertaining to pharmacology and health insurance. The pharmacy can be very stressful at times since it gets very busy in the middle of the day and stays busy until closing. A large portion of the job is committed to filling scripts, processing orders and searching for customer medications. The upside to all of this is that you learn very quickly and get exposed to working in a fast paste environment."
good,"You're busy from the time you get in to the time you leave, and there is little encouragement to rest when you need to. Corporate seems to focus on all the negative comments we receive from customers, while ignoring all good feedback we receive."
good,The workload is so heavy even trying to use the restroom is almost impossible. Long hours with a little break. So understaffed its ridiculous. If you can find a way to be in 2 places at once or clone yourself that would be beneficial. Low pay compared to other pharmacies.
good,Very busy. Extremely Stressful. Long hours with little time for break. There was no time for Customer Service. Production was timed. It seemed to be all about the numbers and not about the customers.
good,"Management seems to favor anyone under the age of 30,they advance quicker than people with experience. And the moral is very very low with CVS. Benefits are nice but I losing my insanity and management didn't care."
good,Its a good college job. i would not recommend it for a career. it does allow you to build a resume and gain great experience but there are no benefits and the pay is horrible for what you do.
good,"Overall you can't progress in the company as a technician and they are only hiring part time so you don't full benefits only medical. Also they stress you out making sure you enroll people in Readyfill, text messaging , and now Flu shots. I feel like the company only care about numbers and pleasing every customer and that's not being realistic. The customers complain about the long lines and their medication not being ready which is due to being understaff and insurance companies not covering medications."
good,"Pharmacy work at CVS used to be about helping patients improve their health and help patients make informed and empowering health decisions. How it's all about how many Rx you can fill, in what time frame, and make sure all patients pick up their Rx in a timely manner."
good,Cvs overall ia a great company.  Your work is experience is based off the environment and the staff you have to work with/ or in.  Shoot your shot if your interested.
good,"A typical day at work includes moving non-stop from the second you walk in the door to the second you leave."
good,"Like job duties. Understaffed for work needed. Compensation below average, poor benefits, Heavy on bureaucracy and old boys network. Vacation and time off only positive benefit."
good,"Customer service through filling prescriptions, answering incoming phone calls, joined the pharmacy tech program with the company promising fulltime after training, completed training 3 months after hiring and been there about a year and a half and barely work 10 hours a week, I enjoy working with the customers, however I need a full time position to support my family. I was looking to change careers but have decided that working fulltime and needing healthcare coverage that this company is not going to give that for me and my family."
good,nice place to work for a starter job. benefits are pretty good. easy going work environment. requires good customer service skills aka people skills are a must!
good,i dont think the company has good comuunication when it comes to telling their employees information. 'The change of management has its good and bad moves and their is no set hours here and some people their are very nosey and talk about your buisness around the warehouse.
good,"My pharmacy manager would always put the business first and in some cases would put the patients and employees second. I just had a bad experience with the management by being denied help and ignoring my requests. I finally wanted to transfer closer to home as I was hired in a store about 30 minutes from my town, and I was denied due to timing and inconvenience for the business."
good,"It is a good place to gain experience for newcomers. I was only there because they were flexible with my college schedule. Well, in 5 years I have had 6 different store managers, but none the less they were great to work with. They do not offer any benefits to part time employees, no pto, paid vacation, pay is not good, and do not offer any incentives to their employees that are in college such as tuition reimbursement (only for full time), and only hire externally for corporate positions, while there are many part time students that work for the company. I have been there 5 years and have not reached $10 as a cashier. High turnover rate in the company. Worry a lot more about customers than employee needs. Companies like Amazon and Walgreens, will put an end to CVS in the near future. Long term, not the best company to work for not unless you are a store manager or above."
good,"Long story short, you work your butt off to get paid less to nothing. Not much advancing opportunities. Definitely not a job you want to make a life-long career out of."
good,"If you are working on becoming a certified pharmacy tech, they will provide on the job training while you work on certification. Some locations are better for training. All stores reduce hours drastically during the summer except for the pharmacist who receives a bonus if he/she keeps hours to the limit provided by upper management."
good,Always understaffed and underpaid. My direct supervisors are great- but working for a corporate company guarantees that your work is overlooked and you are not appreciated.
good,I enjoyed working here as it was always busy but the managers would just sit around like they had nothing to do in the back.  This did not bother me until they started getting on to me about duty which i was during.  I was never completely train as it seems no one wanted to train me
good,"I have learned to adapt to 21 different locations and workload volumes and to manage many different staff members with ease. Unfortunately, there is little to no back up from management regarding pharmacy administration, volume workload, and scheduling.  It is rather clear that we are not valued in the retail stores. It is my desire to find a workplace with a deeply rooted culture in ethics, patient care, and stability."
good,"Management is expected to do everything from stocking, changing sets, running the register, cleaning, putting up new ad signs/taking down old signs, sometimes all in one day by themselves.  "
good,"The warehouse has out grown it's space. The pickers are falling over each other, using paper orders that are rarely used in todays world. The lighting is horrible, and the warehouse is very hot. Turnover is also high due to less than perfect working conditions such as being sent home early one day, then working 11 hours the next ."
good,"It's a tough working environment, you always feel short staffed and you always feel like you are verifying a dangerous number of prescriptions way too quickly with very little support. The benefits are poor. The company is too big and not properly managed. Techs should be paid more, there should be a better structure for advancement for techs, and there should be a better way to train the staff quickly. Hiring is also difficult - pharmacy cannot hire their own staff (must come from front store) which doesn't always attract the right people to the position. Attendance policies are so loose the techs can call out sick numerous times without penalty. No structured lunch breaks for pharmacists. Pharmacists have to work with their team to make up a schedule so it depends on how well you work with your partners if your schedule is good or not."
good,"We have so much to do with not enough hours to do them. Every time we come to work, it's a different task, when we're not finish with the tasks the day before."
good,Many patients who come on a daily basis have brought brief but enjoyable interactions relating to their precription needs and some personal interactions.
good,"They pay is not good at all, for the work that we do, and plus there is also no advancement. Typical day at work would be filling prescriptions, getting cursed out by patients, ringing up customers, stocking and cleaning."
good,Hard work for little pay there are higher paying jobs that aren't as stressful as this was for me at least. They don't keep many employees staffed in the compounding room and warehouse because the company is very much a tightwad type company. No OT if you do work over 8 they have you come in later of take an extended off the clock lunch so they don't have to pay you OT.
good,I enjoy my job. I do not approve of the consent change in instructions to a position. Takes away from people's ability to comprehend and excel. Some leadership is easy to approach in difficult scenarios. High turn over.
good,"It is a great place to start as your first job after pharmacy school. After being trained by CVS, every job after CVS will be an easy job. You learn to appreciate you job a lot more."
good,"Overall, I'm okay with working for this company, they allow me to work 12 hrs a day as I choose to  which make me grow in the department of training an building myself . which something I pron myself on growth within the company. They see an drive advancement when is ask by the employee."
good,High stress environment and short staffing due to internal budget cuts does not help patient outcomes. Number one priority is profit margins rather than patient care.
good,the work environment it a bit tense. The supervisor tends to micro- manage. the work is very stressful and there is not a lot of support from the supervisor.
good,"At CVS everyone will change station every 2 hours. It is very busy so you have to stay focus. I like working at CVS. We have four station to rotate to: pick, drop off, drive thru, and production. I like working drop off the most."
good,"-They usually work you 4 hour shifts."
good,"This job will take you away from core responsibilities of a pharmacist, very tasky.  "
good,"It was a good first job but not for long term. Overall, the work environment is always busy and hectic. Sometimes, there are slower days but not common."
good,not a fantastic company to work for but also not the worst. not closed for an holidays (including Christmas) and over time is almost never approved. if you do not catch on to things quickly you will not succeed here
good,"Small salary for responsibilities given. Better working in the mall for the same salary. Company doesn't care about it's employees. Hired a pharmacy manager straight out from school, he did not even know how to use a register. All the work was put on techs. Too much responsibility for such a small salary. No benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my professional work at CVS - connecting with patients and working with technicians. However, the corporate model stressed numbers and metrics over actual patient interaction. Culture was negative and never recognized the ""Small Stuff."""
good,"I love working at cvs."
good,"I was a teleworker, and my position was one that transferred to CVSC from another employer with a strategic partnership. I can speak very little to most CVSC culture, but that I encountered was limited and not particularly appealing."
good,I I enjoy working at CVS I know all the customers by name and I'm able to take care of them properly i've been the lead technician for several years and I enjoy helping the customers taken care of them and enjoy seeing them daily basis customers look to me to help them and taking care of their medication and talking to me about helping them find a reasonable priced medication
good,I honestly did not enjoy working at CVS Pharmacy. The management never cared about the bad employees and just put all the pressure on the good ones. I didn't enjoy my time there.
good,"Due to the nature of retail and it's demands for speed with efficacy, Cvs fails to provide new recruits with any system of practical training once an official member of the pharmacy staff. It could be several months before a new technician will see any area of the pharmacy besides the register and are ill prepared to handle more advanced tasks for too long."
good,"Only experience with one store but very little communication, poor management and scheduling, poor support for employees, and low work ethic. There's no motivation to better the store or complete all of your assigned tasks to the best of your ability so more often than not, I felt responsible for picking up the slack of other employees."
good,"environment was good, fast pace."
good,"not enough employees, over work and not enough training. not a good place to work they only care about making money and not there employees. i dont recommned."
good,"•	Responsible for coding the client plan design within the adjudication support system(s)."
good,cvs could be better on how they help their employess. technicians do not get paid enough money and part times workers should get some benefits
good,Fast paced work environment. Lots to learn and good learning environment. Managers co-ordinate and help in the progress. The hardest part of the job is working in night shift.
good,the job is ok if you need somewhere to start until you can find a good job that pays good. but i would never go back to this job unless i just really need something
good,"A typical day is processing prescriptions to be delivered to patients in nursing home facilities. What I have learned is pharmacy knowledge including medication information such as alternate names, what drugs are used for. The management recently changed and is challenging due to everyone not being on the same page in reference to policies, payroll, rules and regulations etc.The hardest part of the job is meeting the stringent time constraints each hour due to having to get multiple time consuming clarifications. The training also does not adequately prepare you to preform the job in the manner the company expects. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist patients in receiving the medication  that they need.Another enjoyable part of the job is the teammates. The team is incredibly helpful and a joy to work with."
good,"The company paints a picture of patient centered care, although contradicts its beliefs by working pharmacy staff to the bone with unachievable goals and expectations with the staff and budget allotted.  Pharmacy managers are expected to work off the clock to balance the workload for less than 3% annual incentive and less than 3%, sometimes no increase in yearly salary."
good,"Cvs is a secure job, They are located every where so your always able to transfer. But they highly under pay you. You have to fight for what you want and not to be over worked like a mule."
good,"There was always a lot of work to do and a lot of multitasking. Phones are ringing, patients are in drive through and at the front counter waiting to be helped. You have to be able to multitask or else you will fall behind."
good,"After many years with this company, I was able to gain valuable knowledge pertaining to the Pharmacy Benefit Management industry."
good,"Customers are not very happy due to the reason that they are even at the pharmacy (Ex. They are ill, or a family member may be ill, etc). Patience is a must with this job, but management is not very good. Very busy, no downtown hardly ever and no breaks are allowed. You only get a 30 min lunch in a moldy breakroom."
good,Working at CVS can be a great experience if you get the right people and right resources needed to run one. Unfortunately a lot of CVS stores are not provided what they need to run as a proper retail store.
good,"good place to work, nice people good location nice hours of operation and safe place to work.  the pay sholud be better but the work environment is good."
good,Coming in i was excited for being part of a team of people who want to help make people lives better and we did but some patients and some floating pharmacist are a bit more demanding than others. i do love this job and i wish i could of stayed but unfountantly i was always getting extended past my scheduled time and being accused of situations i had no control over. yes it sounds bad but my team was awesome and i will miss them very much.
good,"Training is done almost entirely by reading tons and tons of manuals that they will then quiz you on.  It's hours worth of boring manual reading just to be a cashier."
good,"Typical day is not bad. Your not policed as they expect you to be able to be unsupervised. "
good,"This particular job was just a normal environment everyone was pleasant and great to be around."
good,Procuro agir de maneira a cumprir minha tarefa de trabalho de forma a respeitar as normas e horário
good,"I work in order entry entering in prescription medications for nursing homes in Cincinnati, Dayton, and Kentucky Homes. I also enter in Narcotics and control medications, processing IV medications. I also have to pay special attention because each facility is different with the requirements of receiving medications. I also intake the demographic information into the system as well too. I work in more than one ques as well as multitasking to get the job done."
good,"I worked in the Mountain View building.  It it's entirety, this building held a cold and partially grimey feel. This, and the non-existent company culture are my loudest complaints. "
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Omnicare. constant work everyday great work place to learn new things, enjoy my fellow coworkers"
good,"Great place to work for fast cash. Don't plan on having a career though. With the new owner CVS, they are shipping all the positions out west and overseas as fast as they  possibly can. But really enjoyed my temp contract while I was there. Made great friends and great money."
good,Hard to stay in one department of the warehouse because of getting tired from doing the job in the department you're in. And most of the time it seems that there is favoritism between leads and supervisors and other employees.
good,Although the customers can be crabby at times and yell/curse at you. I found my job to be very rewarding. The pay was not enough for the amount of things we had to do. The higher ups didn't care if we're short staffed or not. Management was poor and very biased. I'll miss my regular customers but that's all I'll miss from this company. I gained a lot of knowledge in the pharmacy.
good,management was very unhelpful when questions needed to be anwsered. this job required much help learning 3 different systems in which we placed our orders. I had wonderful co-workers in which we all worked together to learn the system and successfully place orders. The most enjoyable part of this job was exceeding 150 orders each day as I got more familiar with the systems.
good,"In the pharmacy they were very cliquey and rude. If anyone who is newer has a question about something that they didn't understand, other workers get frustrated and yell at them. They also aren't very compassionate about their coworkers and all were very selfish."
good,Paid alright but never had any updates on what the hours were like or work. There management was all about CVS's well-being then their workers. Their turnover rate is horrible too.
good,Can be busy when the customers are steady! Management is okay when it comes to most things. I love my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is trying to make an angry customer happy.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to personally know my customers
good,"I worked for this company for this for a few years and it was a great enviroment. We were bought out by a bigger party and the moral and safety of your job was determined more on race, back stabbing and tremendous amounts of drama. I liked the work I did, working with another state and helping with the care of sick patients. I learned a great deal about customer service, Clinical managment and a numerous amounts of other skills. I was happy I had the opportunitly to work there."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. I learned to work their registers, software, privacy laws, and different information about drugs. I really like the pharmacists that I work with, very easy going. For the most an enjoyable place to work."
good,"Good place to work if you enjoy working independently. High management turnover. Newer management does not appreciate hard work from employees. Newer management had never worked in this type of area before and were not very friendly. A few employees had to teach and work massive overtime  to help new incoming staff, cover for new supervisors and management."
good,Its a great company. However I feel that they focus more on top positions than the lower positions. Overall a good high-school job.
good,"Pros"
good,"Pleasant work atmosphere. Usually good staff provided. Good on teamwork."
good,"Fast paced atmosphere, with lazy coworkers. You get praised for doing your job well by having to do theirs also. Customers are aggressive and abusive. They can say whatever they please to you, and then you'll owe them a gift card for not being better at taking abuse. Not allowed to stand up for yourself. Upper management is awful. Days goes by fast because of how many people you'll deal with in your shift. The tech in training program was beneficial in helping me receiving my state and national licenses. Cvs pays for all training and one test per person. The front store thinks they are above you and will always have something to say about it."
good,This job is ok. For what all you do pay could be better.The hours are not too bad.vompany open holidays and weekends. Only one late day during the week. Benefits are ok. A lot of mandatory overtime. They don't care about you or your family to an extent. They would like you there 24/7 if they could have it their way. Mainly through busy season. And have the nerve to get mad or try and make you feel guilty if you cant do OT. Its all in the way they treat you. Would be told by management that your are doing well but not let you grow.Too many folks trying to be boss.  A lot of favoritism. This place of employment is not for everyone. But no job is perfect I guess.
good,"Well it depends on your location and your management but it really gets busy at my store. The customers are rude, i get directed by managemnt to stop what i am doing everytime someone comes to the register and thats every minute, try typing up a prescription and answering a phone call while your boss is behind you telling you to get the next person in line."
good,"Typical day would be to sort and file filled prescriptions away.  Send verification via fax to doctor's offices to ensure the pharmacy had the correct prescription.  Keep my area clean and neat.  Ensure all paperwork was filed correctly in regards to prescriptions."
good,"very stressful, no work life balance.  Little to no front end support; unreasonable expectations and goals"
good,You will be worked like an animal and be paid very little. The other employs and management are irritated half of the time because of the workload. You only get a 30 minute break if you work a full shift. The only plus is that the store has air conditioning and the customers are funny.
good,"very rude management, no order or organization, team building minimal, and favoritism shown to certain employees."
good,"Often under staffed had to handle multiple stations to keep the work flow going smoothly."
good,"Pharmacists at CVS are very helpful and knowledgeable. The district managers, however, have favorites, so if you have an ethical concern such as workplace harassment, forget it. Pay sucks."
good,"A typical day at CVS would be slow up until noon or sometimes 3 p.m when the kids get out of school or during rush hour. I learned how to stock the shelves with merchandise. Management at CVS wasn't always the best however, it wasn't completely terrible. My co-worker was very helpful when they were there. The hardest part about the job was trying to leave the cashier to help a customer because it was nobody there to help the customer but me. The part I enjoyed the most was being able to make the customer visit at CVS very welcoming and putting a smile on their faces."
good,"it was an okay job. although i was a pharmacy technician, i mostly felt like a regular cashier. One of my head pharmacists came to work drunk on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work would include production, answering phones, helping customers with several task like, insurance, pick up, and drop off. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking between pulling medications, ringing up customers and keeping everyone happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting customers over the phone while helping them rebill the cost on their medications."
good,"Work environment is not safe.  Most stores are understaffed and RPhs are all overworked. For the growing script counts per store, the company is failing in providing enough support."
good,Perhaps it's because I survived through their start-up that leaves such an ugly impression but they stink. Management frequently requests feed back from the employees and then tosses that feed back away. Pats themselves on the back for fixing broken things but only after Corporate has come in and hand led them to solutions that the employees had been complaining about. A constant hamster wheel effect causing never end recycling of poor choices that leads to the same inevitable situations that cause more overtime in an endless train crash. Despite this the other employees are generally good folks though some are perpetual liars. Decent enough benefits though a push to unionize was prevalent before I left.
good,"Filing prescriptions, processing prescription rejections, confirming insurance coverage, helping customers.. training students/interns. management wasn't the best in the store -front end or pharmacist-"
good,"typical high volume store with high demand for customer service. multitask and micromanagement of inexperience pharmacy technicians required. i learned how to communicate efficiently and to multitask. my pharmacist colleagues are hard workers, however technicians are relatively new, so a lot of micromanagement is necessary, which can be very distracting from my primary duty to quality assurance and to provide patient care. the hardest part of the job is as mentioned above, to maintain customer service, accuracy of verification while micromanage inexperienced staff and deal with large amount of prescription in very limited time frame. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help patients improve their health."
good,"Long and stressful workdays, but I'm blessed to have a cooperative and positive team. You'll gain alot of knowledge and appreciate the skills that you will utilize daily."
good,"Being passionate about Pharmacy and being a tech is what made my work enjoyable. Outside of that, I feel CVS needs to work on their professionalism. My goal as a tech is to provide good customer service at all times and in order to do that, proper training must be provided which I don't feel they take the time to do with new employees. I have seen many employees quit because of this. I am a self learner and because of that I feel I was able to do my job well."
good,"It's another customer service job, Learn to use a register, How to face and stock the store. Pretty mundane. Same customers, Same items."
good,Working at apac can be a little off balance. Working there everyday is challenging having to deal with unprofessional staff as well as supervisor. Although I do enjoy being able to how my great communication and customer service skills bot only to customers but also to my team. The hardest part of my job is communicating with the staff supervisor. Not getting enough feedback to let me know what i need to improve in and what I'm doing great at. I'm seeking work where i can grow with the company.
good,"Lack of communication through out the departments. Poor management. Lay offs year to year. Started out good then restructuring and firing led to new management every few months, no stability"
good,CVS is a good company to work for if you work in a store with a good manager/team. If you do not have a good team then your job is very difficult.
good,"A lot of changes happening right now. Definitely not the same environment as with Target, but we shall see how it goes. Updating systems and trying to maintain customer service"
good,"its ok does not pay that great ,but overall its good and has stability as a job not much room to grow your career "
good,"There have been many ups and downs while working with this company, but overall, I have met some wonderful people, both co-workers and patients, and I have made a difference in their lives.  The majority of the time, management has been very supportive and helpful."
good,"Heave work load with minimal support from upper management, hours allowed for payroll were always under the required amount to provide a successful environment"
good,"Its good company for US citizens and there is a very good work life balance here, management is also good as long as you are not asking for any thing."
good,Pharmacy technicians are both valued and unappreciated at this retail location. These inconsistencies that are normally directed towards the technicians come from both the patients and management. You can expect to see everything from support to degradation. The one thing that you can definitely count on is learning proper customer service and support.
good,"I enjoyed my work at CVS Health. The part that I like best about my job was working with the representatives that would call from the floor with questions or situations they could not figure out.. It was great to be able to help them and teach them and sometimes coach them. I also enjoyed taking over the escalated calls from members. I enjoyed the challenge of de-escalating them, finding options, and resolving their issues and/or concerns. I was a very positive influence to everyone I talked with and worked with. There was a good :team"" oriented atmosphere there."
good,this company wants it employees to work with little associate help due to the lack of hours that is given to every store which decreases every year
good,"In my position time management is very key. You do not have someone micro managing your work and you work at your own pace, but there are deadlines that must be met. The grievance department is a small team of about 10 individuals whom are very close knit and work together to achieve case closures."
good,"I started off with this company started off as a cashier, then promoted to a shift supervisor, and lastly as a pharmacy technician. I was promoted three times before I even reached my 8 months with the company. I have now been with the company for almost 2 years and have learned many new skills I can improve and utilize else where. A typical work day is never promising on the work flow, we will either be busy, or have a steady work flow. The job is demanding and the lack of compensation is heartbreaking, however the patients and few customers that thank and greet us for our hard-work on our busiest and short staff days and treats they bring us for our services is priceless. The hardest part of working here is the hours not being consistent, and work scheduled not being posted ahead of time where balancing work and personal life become a complex task. How ever all technicians and pharmacist all get along, communication is always consistent, we help one another when a task becomes a mild stone for the day."
good,"fast pace work environment"
good,Very demanding position with very little compensation.  Worked nonstop during shifts with no downtime.  The coworkers were great The Pharmacist and store management were very pleasant to work for. The store manager was an excellent mentor and made each day on the job a great learning and fulfilling experience.  There were not enough hours to provide a stable income.
good,"I actually quite like my job and CVS as a whole, however they offer low compensation for a job that requires a lot of training. Every location seems to struggle to keep employees and as such those that do work there are often overwhelmed. The company needs to do more to foster a work place that is worth the effort one puts into it."
good,"A typical day at CVS is a mad house with 3 techs and1 pharmacist running the show. Our store can do up to 1,600 scripts a week and with only so little help. Its crazy, but somehow we manage to acccomplish what needs to be done for the day. This wouldn't happen if there wasn't any team work! My co-workers are the back bone of this pharmacy and without their help and excellent customer service nothing would get done.  I've learn that in this business that multi-tasking is a must!  The hardest part of the job is making sure every prescription is fill by its designated pick up time, and to also ensure that the customer walks away happy.  The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am able to help a customer out. Especially if they can't afford their medication because insurance won't cover it.  I will go above and beyond and reproccess with different discount cards we have until the best price is available."
good,"I have learned how to navigate  the different computer systems that they have, I like the people that I work with they are friendly and each person has something different that they bring to the table"
good,If yo are planning on becoming a pharmacist I would not recommend that you start out as a technician but just go straight through the program. You will save yourself a lot of hassle.
good,"Loved my actual job. Got tired of the shift, high volume work load with additional/new responsibilities from a different department thrown into the mix without being fully trained in the new area added to the stress and confusion. Schedule could have been done better for coverage during busier days. Certain rules not being inforced so too much playing on cell phones was frustrating during extremely busy times and/or talking for long periods of time (while on the clock) distracting everyone else trying to work. Then management not understanding why we complain or become frustrated and then being considered whiners and/or negative did not set well with me."
good,It is a very big company that focuses on a lot of numbers and metrics. These metrics also go hand in hand with patient care. I gained great experience in managing multiple situations and personalities..
good,"This is the same as CVS Pharmacy, not sure what else I can say. I already reviewed CVS. It's all one company. Read CVS Pharmacy review."
good,Rather work else where. The training is nice but not enough benefits to stay. People constantly quit because of lack of hours and cutting hours.
good,"Coram is an okay place to work, They need new management that care about what the employees and someone that actually come out of the office to see how things are going. If they get rid of the manager and put someone in the company that know how to communicate with the staff this place could be awesome."
good,"They have a decent employee discount, but don't go there  looking for full time work although I did learn almost everything there is to know about being a pharmacy tech, I don't feel that there was enough room to grow with their company."
good,"The store I am at is only a few years and still growing. I enjoy working with the people I do and the management is good with being flexible with my hours. The staff is often overworked and not given breaks, even when working a 9 or 10 hour shift. The pay is terrible for the amount of work and skill my job takes."
good,"Management needs improvement.  Reviews based on geographical site where employed.  No written records of progress and accomplishments,  no meeting agendas, follow-ups assigned and not notes (minutes of meetings) so management has no basis for reviews. Employees were told ""you can be replaced"" continously.   Therefore management style is ""Just keep the boss HAPPY""."
good,bosses come and go to easly some great some not so great cowokers are alright but they do make you work hard and when u work hard its not good enof
good,"If there was support from upper management, it would be a great place to work. I have worked for the company for almost 2 years and they have been sold to CVS Health. Nothing has been communicated other than Omnicare was sold."
good,"Very fast-paced work environment . Management okay could use a little more training . Co-workers most of them easy to get along with but some likes to think their the boss. Hardest part of job is staying caught somehow CVS no matter what location seem like , their just hard to stay on time with scripts. Besides above they have good benefits and try to show appreciation to their employees."
good,"I worked for this company for six years d i tried very hard to advance my potion. They don't care how hard of a worker you are if they don't like you they will never promote you. I have been told by many coworkers im good at this job but the management doesn't care. they only look at the negative never at the positive and they are all about their stores number sales returns all that stuff. there is no loyalty to the lower workers from the managers, non what so ever."
good,"Working for a mail order facility, the job was a good starting position but there was no job advancement opportunities. I felt like the company demanded more of the workers than what we were getting paid for."
good,"Consistently busy, under staffed. Very high work load. There was rarely any lunch breaks. You were looked down upon if you had to call in sick. Too much work drama."
good,"Very regimented company. Does not allow any creativity. Expects employees to be 100% company oriented. All communications are scripted. Employees are not well respected. Not a free spirited environment work place. On a scale of 1 to 10 , I would give CVS a score of 4 simply because wages and benefits are acceptable."
good,"check out customers on a daily base"
good,"I was the first and only liquor manager for CVS in Las Vegas Nv."
good,"As an IV tech at Coram you need to be ready to work nonstop from the time you arrive until every single order is mixed and ready to ship. When you arrive, quickly garb in and don't leave the clean room until your 1 break which is 30 minutes long. I learned how to exercise my time management skills and to work efficiently under pressure."
good,It's a good job. Wonderful people and a great work environment. Managers are understanding and helpful and the Pharmacists are great too. Starting wage is a bit low considering the work you do.
good,Great people to work with. A worthy service to provide to patients so they can infuse their medicines in the comfort of their own homes.
good,I work on a dedicated team and I help medicare clients with getting their medications and I also enroll new members and take care of billing issues as well.. I enjoy working with people it makes me feel like when I help our members I have accomplished something.
good,"CVS is an work in progress. I believe they are too focus on the customers experience than their employee's experience and growth.  Usually, under staffed and over worked for less pay."
good,Work with a great group of people.  A typical work day is very busy with long hours.  Management is good but good use some work in listening to things that work for their employees and things that don't work.
good,"Good pay however management of internal issues are never handled accordingly, I think that in order to provide customer service there needs to be more structure to allowed for full use of budgeted hours"
good,My hours were 10 to 6.  I would maintanin the vitamin area and consultant with customers regarding their personal vitamin needs and requirements.  This consultation invloved their current medications and any interractions that may occur and also the proper steps in ensuring they get the maximum benefits from the recomended supplements.
good,CVS was fun at times and I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"500 plus prescriptions a day, phones ringing off the hook, lines everywhere and non stop work around the clock. Time flies by relatively quickly due to heavy work load. There's always something that needs to be done. There's always ways to improve, multitasking is a required skill and being fast on your feet. The most enjoyable part is learning about pharmacy work and bringing great customer service to customers. Hardest part is the workload and getting everything done during your shifts. Hours being cut makes the workload seem impossible at times and meeting prescription deadlines."
good,"As a supervisor, I am typically at the store before everyone else arrives and present after hours. The vast majority of problem solving is on my shoulders, and I am required to perform my duties often in addition to many others. My store manager prefers that we are able to work without direct oversight, and that we can perform under pressure without much support. This allows each of us to become strong individuals and leaders. "
good,"CVS is a profit oriented business and employees are an exploitable resource. They offer employment for part-time production workers to keep their profits high. If you don't mind not getting benefits and working inconsistent hours then this may be a good fit for you. They have very high standards for production, accuracy and time management. Also are very keen on changing policies and procedures at will. You do become a member of a Union for what that is worth. Lots of great people worked there. Many have been replaced by part time associates."
good,Easy Job when you work well with others. company promotes from within.
good,"Day to day operations opening and closing the store. Hiring and building an effective team. Sales and customer service. Loss prevention , building effective relationships with the community."
good,"CVS Caremark is a great company for those just graduating high school and/or retirees. It is laid back and the call volume is steady for the welcome /new benefit ""insurance"" season.  I've learned better customer service skills and furthering my ""Do it yourself"" skills. Management is not all that easy to deal with nor all that hard but for the most part they are usually on your side with certain things."
good,I worked for Cvs pharmacy for 8 years. I gained so much knowledge from retail experience.
good,"Good place to get experience, but they do not compensate their technicians well."
good,I am currently a contract employee and working on a specific project.  Will only last for another 4 months.
good,I had a very nice boss who taught me everything I know. He was more than willing to help me with issues and very patient when I made mistakes. The district manager and corporate managers very very good at what they did at the time.
good,I left a company to go work here for promises that were not delivered.
good,"nice place, lots of work, allways bussy. we have great co-workers and its nice helping people to get better."
good,"Ipost payments "
good,A management position with CVS is a 24 hour a day 7 days a week commitment. The training program at CVS is an in depth process that prepares an individual to run their own store in as little as 6 -12 months.
good,"Ok place to work if you're working towards something better, otherwise don't expect it to provide much for your family."
good,filling prescriptions in a timely manner along with assisting customers
good,CVS was a great company to work for in many ways such as technology and customer service.  it was fun working with young people and interacting with customers.  I learned to be an effective leader through the programs supplied to us as employees.
good,Good job until they laid off the department. Expected a lot of production out of each employee without any errors.
good,"Keep the store clean, stock shelves, ring at the register, handle customer service, report theft"
good,"Satisfying work environment, but upper management is highly demanding and only results-oriented."
good,"I have learned how to work in a fast paced environment by pacing myself and never losing focus of the most important tasks. I have learned strong communication skills and how to deal with difficult customers. I am very detailed oriented, and have excellent computer skills, since typing a prescription and billing insurances requires these abilities. I love working with diverse people and serving customers."
good,"Finding out what part of the pharmacy I work in for my shift is usually the surprise, but a good one. Eventually I get to see and work in almost every aspect of the pahramcy except the verification of prescriptions done by the Pharmacist. Management provides aid but are separate from the pharmacy. The teamwork is I think the best aspect of the job! I arrived and was welcomed as a new team member right away, as they need all the help they can get within a store that does over 300 prescriptions a day. I enjoy the people from all areas of the world that visit and somehow make their way into the pharmacy during their stay with us. It is wonderful to meet the locals and tourists alike."
good,"Job duties ranged"
good,I have learned many skills from this company. The pay is good. Every one is friendly
good,"CVS along with every job in my opinion has its ups and downs. CVS has a very clean and fast paced working environment and that is really nice. I do not like the hours, they are open until 10pm every night and I prefer the first shift schedule. They have been recently cutting hours back for the technicians, so that means less and less hours and I need at least 40 hours a week to stay a float. CVS is not a bad company to work for, they have a lot of things they need to work on in my opinion as far as the safety environment (updating things in the store) and as far as caring for their employees a little more.The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to make someone have a better day and walk away with a smile."
good,"This was my first job, being sixteen I knew it wasn't going to be easy. The first couple weeks came and went like a breeze the co workers were great, the manger was ok. Then a month in problems started happening, and because I was the newbie I was being accused. Thus why I quit."
good,"Decent job security but not much room for advancement.  Most higher positions are filled from the outside.  Managers tend to block your advancement in order to keep good employees in their current position and prevent them from having to hire new employees."
good,"Work is always hectic but always a learning experience. The store I currently work at is one of the few 24 hour stores in the area and is a high-traffic environment. As a state certified pharmacy tech, I have learned a lot about the pharmaceutical industry, and the amount of effort put in to completing prescriptions. Management is easy to get along with but can ignore simple requests in order to meet a time deadline. My co-workers are easy to get along with and help with the hard and fast-paced environment. The hardest part of the job is the treatment by customers and the lack of enough staff members in cases of call outs and coverage issues. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to organize the bi-weekly medication orders, and re-organize the pharmacy."
good,"very busy fast paced position. Steady workflow, always something to do."
good,"I worked for the company, on and off, in two locations, for many years. In both stores, I had great coworkers and managers, for the most part."
good,"My typical day at work consist of many, patients many refills ; a lot of data entry . I learn every day about new medications and their side affect. How to educate the patient too live a longer helthy life.."
good,"My job at the moment is a love and hate thing. I'll just start on the least likes about the job. As I always mentioned in my resumes. You need alot and I mean ALOT of patience. You will get people who will put you down for mistakes you don't even do or stuff that doesn't make sense. And to mix all the frustration the main question you will always hear is, ""Why is my medication not ready?"" All I can do is find out why is all I can say even though I don't know why. On top of that, as you are trying to figure out just one problem, you get thrown with phone calls. And believe me, they are almost just as bad sometimes. Because of all this, I don't even take breaks because there is just a ridiculous amount of work to do in a budgeted amount of hours. There are so much more I can dwell with a typical day at work but I would just end up making a giant list. Now the best part about my job are my co workers. They are like family to me and they struggle as much as I do on a daily basis and we trust each other as a team. The main thing to keep our sanity is actually joking around with each other which I love the most. My co workers make my job in CVS barely bearable. Without them, the 3 stars overall would probably be lower than what it is now. Overall a job in CVS Pharmacy is a pretty good place to start with. They do hire people quite often and are always looking for people. That is what is good about the company too. My main advice would be do not EVER show people your frustration. Some people have stuff going on with their lives. Always keep your cool and you will do fine."
good,"Enjoyed working with public, hours were long. All forms were hard to deal with"
good,"A typical day of work consists of providing world class customer service to a wide range of members. At any given time I can recieve a call from a member, a pharmacists, or provider service .I love the members that we service because they are of the senior citizen community."
good,Productive work environment.  Easy access to the freeway.  Very pleasant and willing to help co-workers.
good,"The first time I worked at a CVS in Maryland and I had amazing co-workers and pharmacists. My pharmacist always made sure he worked with our schedules so we got the hours we both wanted and needed. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is i love what i do on daily basis and helping patients everyday to make their life better. The hardest part of job is to balance job work and personal life due to heavy workload.
good,The work was good but the atmosphere was tense.  Not the best phone system and sales people would yell at you if they did not want the call you gave them
good,"You get breaks when you can, no set time - sometimes not at all or if you so you will be asked to stay late to be able to keep up. Management only cares about the numbers and comes up with more paperwork that isn't necessary to monitor everyone (of course if you put something they don't like down you are told about it). Immediate employees - store managers - are awesome but the ""corporate"" end of it puts too much onto them. Co-workers get along, but over worked people tend to bicker. Pharmacists get no breaks and work from open to close - one pharmacist only - not fair at all! Hardest part was keeping up with the corporate busy paperwork while dealing with sick people who didn't want to be asked 1,000 questions just to pick up their medicine. Most enjoyable part - the team behind the counter - like a family all dealing with the same bull but keeping each other encouraged both on the clock and off of it."
good,"Poor management, stressful environment, unorganized management , things are constantly changing without notice. Good to earn income until you have found a better managed job."
good,Management does not provide enough support to store employees or in-store managers. Pharmacy managers are expected to provide outcomes without enough help or support. Work/life balance is never a consideration.
good,CVS is a retail drug store chain with a retail mentality. It treats employees not much better than Walmart.
good,Not such a bad place. Only challenge was to service the pharmacy drive through within a certain amount of time until a discreet notification alarms to management/pharmacist that servicing a customer took longer than expected.
good,"It is a great place to start off working, but not a life long job or career."
good,"A typical day for a customer service liaison is handling an average of 50 calls a day from members, pharmacies, and doctors offices.  Every call inquiry is different but the most common inquiries are usually for benefit overview information, prior authorizations, drug coverage, help desk, claims and payment information and eligibility. My peers were always the best part of my day. I'm thankful to have been surrounded with such optimistic and fun energized and intelligent people. What I enjoyed most about this job is the constant changes.  It made every day more and more interesting and challenging. The hardest part of the job was working so hard and not being recognized for all the extra effort."
good,Loved the job!  The company discount was awesome making it easy to shop at work instead of other stores.
good,come in at 7am and work till that days numbers were hit.  learned how to work in a fast-paced environment.  hardest part of the job was never knowing when you were going to end your day so making plans for after work or for those with kids made it difficult.
good,"i started from 6 am to 2pm. my job consited to make sure that customers had evething the needed on time , so i had to  explain and try to fix all their concern it was the hardest part of my job. However, i enjoyed the professionalisim of my co-workers."
good,"not a great place to work long hours no overtime"
good,"Enjoy being able to help people, but more job consistency and a regular schedule would be more desirable."
good,"Coworkers are great but management is ineffective and there have been some poor hiring decisions. The salary ranges for each position are so huge that there is quite a bit of an overlap, so it's not unlikely for a newly hired Sr. Consultant to making more money than the Advisors who are training them. Some of the management recognizes that this is a problem, but have no power to change it. Essentially, certain people end up being paid well below market value, which has resulted in very high turnover."
good,"The coworkers are wonderful and friendly! However, management is horrible. One of them in particular is not a manager I would ever want to work under again. She constantly forgets things and does not keep track of time of requests, and has given me a write up for time off that I ""did not ask for"" even though I had a copy of the sheet!!!"
good,"Communication between departments and management was broken. One hand was not always aware of what the other was doing ,made for a chaotic workplace. Lots of rework and unhappy staff"
good,"My typical day at CVS would be ringing up customers for prescriptions once they were ready to be checked out. I rarely got a chance to be in other areas of the pharmacy such as drop-off and preparing medications for the pharmacist to check off and fill. I learned a lot about the medical field especially pharmacology but would not go back to that company due to unfair treatment. The manager cut my hours without any notification and proclaimed that I was not fast enough when I had been at the company for awhile. My co-workers and manager were all friendly in front of me but as soon as someone would leave, their would be gossip about other employees or co-workers."
good,I truly do enjoy the work I do and the faith my superiors have in my problem solving abilities.  We are a fast paced and deadline oriented company which I enjoy and tend to thrive in this environment.  Days at Caremark present regular and sometimes irregular challenges for us as a team to hit our daily goals.  Resolving or rerouting work around problems makes for some trying days.
good,"Every day I learn something new, even though I have been there a little over 2yrs. I still learn how to do knew things and old things in a better & more efficient way."
good,"CVS is a fun place to work offering a lot of variety responsibilities.  CVS empowers employees to make their own decisions and use their best judgement to keep customers satisfied.  However, the hours are difficult so be prepared to close one night and then open first thing in the morning.  Pay for entry level employees is much lower than other retail businesses but supervisors are paid fairly.  "
good,"Filling prescriptions such as pills or liquid medication, cashier, customer service. I learned to count pills and help people. Supervisor was horrible. Co-workers, some were nice, some were rude. Hardest part of the job was working with a supervisor who had split personality. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers. "
good,"I had the great fortune to be sent to Northbrook Illinois for CRD documentation verification up-training and "
good,come to work clock in work the register stock shelves attend to customers agreeable coworkers
good,"I worked at this job a long time. Got along with people for the most part, but the hours were long and the work was hard. Standing on your feet 40 hours a week will really do damage over time. A typical work today you are on go all day and seem to never finish all you have to do. Learned how to handle the public. Co workers rarely got along, always  trying to get each other in trouble, the manager was always in on it. Hardest part of the job was the hours and standing. Most enjoyable part was vacation."
good,I did data entry for Caremark. I assisted in the training of new employees and was also cross trained in many areas of work flow. The one thing I didn't like was working the amount of overtime they made us. We pulled 12 hour shifts 5 days a week. Hardest part of my job was the overtime and trying to keep my focus to meet my production goals.
good,"I loved my job. I been with the company this long. Recently we got over taken by express scripts customers and they worked us to the bone. Then summer hits and business is less and they cut our hours like we don't have bills or families. I just don't think that I am as important to them as I have made this company to me."
good,I loved what I did at CVS because I loved helping the patients and developed some strong relationships with them. What I didn't love was the lack of advancement oppurtunity and sub-par compensation.
good,"I like Omnicare, but upper management could help out a little bit......"
good,Processed all areas of the store where needed.  Customer assistance with photos and floor contact.  I learned film process and able to complete various task that I had no knowledge in.  All coworkers have different personalities and were treated with resect all the time.  The hardest part was perfecting my own expectations or standers that I setup as an individual. I enjoyes pleasing the customers all the time.  
good,This company has a high turnover rate for techs and pharmacists. My store was always in transition as well as I was denied a transfer to another location multiple times by my pharmacy manager. I found this to be a different and at times difficult pharmacy to work for. 
good,The job there is fine.The job requires ability to move fast.i wish the management gave the workers more advance notice on overtime.
good,"Inventory maintenance, fill prescriptions, enter prescriptions into system, and use the register to give patients their prescriptions. "
good,have a good team hardest part is no break through out the day enjoyable moment is helping patients
good,I have worked here for many years and through many acquisitions.
good,"In the pharmacy as soon as you clock in you are busy until you have a break or clock out. Constantly running back and forth from drive-thru to the counter helping customers with questions, computing sales, finding prescriptions, etc. Anwering telephones, organizing bins, and helping customers find products in the store. The management is rude, unprofessional, and uncaring. The customers were my favorite part because I enjoyed helping them and showing them the compassion in hopes they would feel better soon. Most of my customers were sick, but they seen I would go out of my way to make sure they receied the best service I could offer them."
good,"At Caremark I started at 5am opening mail from patients needing their prescriptions filled, I did that by sorting profile from scripts and correspondences in order per envelope. After mail I then went to my cubicle and did order entry. This is reviewing the information and correcting what was wrong and sending it to the pharmacy to be filled."
good,"I enjoy the job I do day in and day out. Work consists of filling and filing prescriptions, entering data, managing inventory and putting away orders. Many phone calls are made to insure patients insurance information is correct and to receive overrides for certain medications."
good,It was a great experience for furthering my knowledge in the healthcare field.
good,"Dealing with the stress is probably the hardest part of the job. Not having work/life balance is the biggest problem. Dealing with the customers and associates is the most rewarding. Knowing that you can be there for people, is very satisfying. The pay is good, but other retailers pay more."
good,I enjoy helping the customers with their orders. Learing more about new drug therapies and insurance procedures. Salary was not what was disussed or alluded to in the hiring process.
good,"CVS is great, but not a lot of room for growth. I have cashiered and been a pharmacy technician. It has been great getting my feet wet, but I am ready to move forward."
good,"Mainly worked on the front register ringing up customers, doing returns, fixing up photo orders. I would also help stalk the shelves and figure out what needed to be ordered next week. The co-workers are not always willing to work as a team like I am. The management does not recognize good work and don't always know how to handle what's on their plate. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unhappy customers. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying those unhappy customers to make them happy ones."
good,Pharmacy is long-term care that changes with federal & state guidelines. It's commitment to compliance results in the daily routines changing frequently.
good,The best thing I can say is I loved having contact with the customers. Being able to take care of their needs was very rewarding. The continuing education for the pharmacy was so self-improving.
good,Worked at a high script volume store where no down time for the most part. Rewarded with some of the patients you get to know. Must think on your feet to assure costumer has a pleasant experience and would refer to friends.
good,"When I started working at CVS Pharmacy, it was great. The hours were flexible, there was plenty of help at the different stations, and my co-workers made things fun. However, months went by and hours were cut, people were constantly transferred, and the employees were not getting recognized for all the good it brought to the company. Instead, the corporate officials scrutinized all that we did ""wrong"". Then, I worked at a location in Florida for a few months and they did not hear what I was saying. Not being fluent in Spanish is a big deal, but the district manager nor the pharmacist in charge did not want to hear it. CVS could be a great company if the people in charge would not only care about the customers, stockholders, and the money but ALSO the employees. There would be no CVS pharmacies if it weren't for the employees working night, days, and holidays displaying great customer service. Also, the percentage for raises for the technicians should be higher. Technicians do almost everything the pharmacists do except verify, consult, and handle CII's. I understand this is a pharmacy and employees should not be ""having fun"" on the job. But if work is not some-what enjoyable, then employees are discouraged and unhappy, which means the environment of the store is the same as well. Happy customers equals happy-well-paid employees."
good,"I have learned 7 years of retail pharmacy, management, and HR/training. I loved my co-workers, but there has been a recent change in management that has made the days less enjoyable."
good,I love my job and what I do. I help people and I take care of their medications. I do not however like my schedule. I work 12:30-9 and I never see my kids and I can never get anything done.
good,Caremark was a typical call center operation.At certain times of year it could be stressful but management was listening which offered hope.I truely enjoyed the people I worked with and still speak to them by phone. There will always be people who want you to assume responsibility for their mistakes and that increases stress.There are very many truely nice people in the world. I would really enjoy speaking with a majority of our clients.
good,I love the enviorment but they dont pay as good. the people are very nice.
good,A typical day is fast paced. I receive prescriptions from customers to fill then by a promised time. Process orders from warehouse and outside vendors. Return unused and expired products. Answer phones and help people continue on a better path to health by insuring that they are on the needed medications.
good,"I have learn't how a domicillary care agency works, and how to build a business , i am responsible for the day to day running of the business, recruiting, training, and new carers , hardest part of the job is the on call 24hours 7 days a week and the responsibilities this brings, the most enjoyable is seeing the high level of care we provide to enable people to live at home."
good,low call volume
good,Meet many diverse people
good,"A typical day is recieveing phone calls from members, pharmacies, doctor office to verify coverage, elig and benefits of the member in questions while staying in compliance with MIPAA and Medicare guidesline."
good,Flexibility was a must with staff changes
good,"Job can be stressful, most co-workers don't care too much about the job making it an even more difficult working environment."
good,"CVS is a great place to learn about the general corporate environment. Its a large corporation with a lot of employees and its hard to advance in that kind of environment. I enjoyed my time there and love the people I worked with on a daily basis, but its time for a change. I'm ready for my next challenge."
good,"The place was great to work at, gave me lots of hours, and were very flexible."
good,"Cvs used to be a productive and fun workplace when everyones on the same team trying to get job in a timely matter, after working for there for some years it just seems as if CVS is starting to hire employees in just to fill a position,because now I've noticed the new employees just don't care about the care.of the customers just by me listening to the conversations between the employee and the customer.."
good,CVS can be a great company but you are not a person you are simply a body that can be replaced.
good,"A typical day at Omnicare would be trying to find a quiet corner so that you can hear yourself think & take customer phone calls with any questions or concerns that they might need answered or you may be on the phone with an insurance company trying to get an override or prior authorization. Trying to find a pharmacist is a joke. The mgr is on his cell phone in his office, when he's there. He does not participate in any pharmacy functions unless, of course, there is a problem, then we have a meeting. The Pharmacist-in-Charge is either outside smoking or talking to the other pharmacists in the ""click"" about the employees that they don't like, whether it's because we don't spend a fortune on our Gucci bags or clothes ."
good,I worked there for 5 years the pay was great but your job requirements are very hard to meet
good,• Customers/patient relations. Computer Operations.
good,"If you idea of working for a company with no room for advancement and working for low income which involves a job status of high income, then this is where you want to be."
good,overall and conpensation is average. Some people had very high standards but there was a push to lower them whenever posible. A lot of people have quit because of poor standards. There has been a lowering of the quanity of pharmacist and loss of nursing homes in the past 4 years maybe because of past management. They will put a schedule then change it several times.
good,Cvs Caremark is a productive and safe place to work. The environment is very cean.
good,"Working the Mid-night shift makes my work night go by fast. I'm able to work with a team of co-workers on specific tasks. We always make sure our store is clean, replenished, and organized so our customers have a great experience when coming to shop with us.. We deliver GREAT customer service to everyone who walks through that door and because so we develop great customer rapport."
good,"A typical day at work involved meeting new people everyday, handling money, giving suggestions to customers when needed, promoting merchandise, and constantly changing from one activity to the next. I learned to better communicate with people. I also learned how to better manage my time.I was not fond of the management because their behavior and attitudes did not reflect the company's values and principals. I enjoyed working together with different people from different places of the world. I think the most difficult part of the job was having to learn to communicate to different people because people have many styles and ways of communicating. I think that the most enjoyable aspect of the job was the learning experiences i received from that job."
good,"I worked and meet a lot of people, we worked hard and got the job done. Management was good in the store can't say the same for hire ups."
good,Lack of security for full time employees.
good,It was great place to work until management seemed to have a problem with senior employees
good,"Great staff, horrible management. The people you work with are great. the management will bully you and pick on you."
good,"My boss was one of those people you hear about.. he only made it because he knew someone, he was young, lazy, and rude to say the least. The shift supervisors were the ones who had the real respect and they made working there very fun and enjoyable."
good,Working for a retail pharmacy can be stressful. Most cooperate goals are focused on money and time efficiency instead of the actual patient. In addition lot of retail pharmacies are under staffed.
good,"Corporate is wonderful "
good,"Working there was a overall good experience, the particular store and people I worked with wasn’t. The managers and assistant managers were lazy and didn’t really guide the associates.   They were unorganized and it was a lot of miscommunication. If I could have transferred to a different store, I probably still would have been there."
good,"Underpaid and overworked, always stuck working the pickup counter and drive thru when i was in the pharmacy, experienced a robbery (attempted robbery)"
good,"A typical day at work was easy most days I was at the front checking people out and stocking items. I learned that I have to be very patient with the customers and always have a positive attitude. I know not all CVS's have the same management but where I worked at the management pretty much sucked. The store manager was rude and was always on the phone with someone else. She never got my schedule right and when I called in because I had school she would get frustrated and have a bad attitude overall. The supervisors/shift managers where cool, sometimes fun and strict. The hardest part of the job was checking out people with coupons or when a lot of people where waiting in the line and their was just me and the manager working that night. It was hard because the customers would get frustrated and when I would call for backup they where busy helping at the pharmacy or busy doing something else."
good,"Forced to take on tasks that was once only for supervisors"
good,"CVS is an overall beneficial, and lovely place to work. However I've found that your experience will largely depend on what store, location, and management you get."
good,"My experience at CVS was a learning one. I challenged by my manager and employees and customers on a day to day basis. However, working a demanding 10-12 hour shift and constantly on the foot is not an ideal for me."
good,"Good starting location to learn, not really someplace youd want to stay for a full career. Opportunities for advancement are there but not much actual advancement is made even once you take those steps."
good,"Overall it's an ok place to work. This is not for the weak hearted, or those that are looking for a work family environment. The benefits for some are great."
good,"Not about Taylor location."
good,Company is thriving and doing great things for the community. The products and services they offer are fluent to what is needed in healthcare. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping elderly and making a difference in someones life.
good,"CVS is heading down a road with the wrong people leading the charge in the stores."
good,"I worked at CVS for about 4 years, and while I met some good people, I also met a lot of bad people. I don't think CVS has a good or clear goal or motive either, other than to sugar coat and pamper customers while making its employees struggle. Now, that could be location based, as I've heard other employees in other states feel okay with their job life, but in my experience I didn't thoroughly enjoy my time there. High stress with loads of overwhelming work to accomplish in a day with little to no assistance since hours were always short. We always felt underpaid for the amount and quality of work we did, and the benefits weren't great. I think it also goes without saying the pharmaceutical industry in itself is bad and we all could see that in our time there. I think CVS can do better for its workers. Fair pay and don't give impossible quotas. Understand we're humans with our own lives and can only do so much with what we're given. Customers aren't always right and shouldn't be allowed to treat us however they please. Not to mention how the industry takes advantage of customers who can't afford their own medication. I saw a lot of people so distraught and upset over the prices of their medications, some being epi-pens and inhalers for either themselves or their children. DO BETTER."
good,"my fellow associates are wonderful people. From Pharmacy Manager. Pharmacist to Technicians, they are caring, hard working people who strive to put their best foot forward every single day in the pharmacy. As for the company, I truly can't say the same. The amount of work that is put upon us as a whole is truly exhausting, unfair and unrealistic. When you have good people working for you, treat them with consideration, not machines. That is what the company has forgotten amount. Now it about money and dividend checks for those who do not work in the pharmacy world. It's really sad, but it's reality."
good,"This is a very good job, if you like to start your day after 11am and avoid the commute. I would only recommend the swing shift which is 1pm - 9pm and includes one or both weekends. The call volume is pua  hana after 3pm and on weekends you need a book just to stay awake. Avoid the overnight shift. Not easy at all! Maybe start the latest at 4pm-5pm nothing after that. It's so slow and you MUST STAY AWAKE or get fired."
good,Recent cut backs in tech staffing is creating resentment among technicians. Very controlled by Metrics that seem to be to be very hard to effect with the staffing and time alloted.
good,I worked for cvs for five years I saw allot of changes. I started of as a beauty department manager and we had a budget to beat to get a bonus. It was within 10& of sales in the beauty department. I worked at a great store it was busy so I was always making my bonus. Soon they made it within 5% of our budgets and took some beauty categories away. It got very difficult. Moved me to a store closer to my house that was very slow. I couldn't make bonus anymore. I could barely afford to live.
good,I think with any job the people you have to work with can either make or break how you feel in a certain environment. When working for this particular store I loved the people so even when the days were long and troublesome I was still happy to be there.
good,"Management need to have strategy, they are just behind cost reduction. Leaders need to have strategy to reduce cost. Leaders need to understand Business model then plan execution startegy."
good,Learning the fast paced world of prescription benefits is amazing. If always learning and stress is what you seek the CVS life is made for you. I learned so much in my time with the company. Overall great experience with overall great people
good,"When I first got hired it was actually pretty good. Wasn’t much to do, but the manager was great. After my first year it just went downhill. My hiring manager had left the company. So the manager we got after was horrible. He just didn’t care about anyone. I worked 4pm-12am because all the morning shifts were always taken. So at night it would just be you and a manager/shift manager. Don’t get sick because they would still want you to come in because no one would want to cover such a late shift."
good,This job is rewarding as far as helping people. Has the potential be a decent work environment only when properly managed. Good place to stay for part time work opportunities. Flexible schedule and decent benefits.
good,a typical day is fast passed trying to get product on the selves or doing planograms while helping the customers. i learned how to complete planograms and became the best and fastest at my store.
good,It is stressful and high paced.  You can end up working with a good team of people but you often have to deal with a lot of rude and angry customers a lot of the time.
good,No full time hours as an order selector/picker.  We worked about 5-6 hours per day.  Ridiculous 100% production standards.  Items are not on the right shelf and not pushed forward for us to retrieve in a timely manner.  Management doesn’t understand the reality of what the job entails.  High turnover rate.  Always new faces every week.
good,Worked here for experience 36 hours trough job club. Iv'e been shopping here for a very long time I know all of the employees and I also get along with the manger well too. I am a very outgoing friendly person who is willing to work anytime throughout the holidays and weekends. I am a very hardworking person also very determined.
good,I worked in the Lincoln call center. I enjoyed it. They have a full service cafeteria and plenty of room for growth within the company. Some of the cons are that it is a call center environment. Rules are strict in regards to attendance and productivity. Unscheduled breaks are frowned upon (unscheduled is using the bathroom outside of your scheduled break) it will count against your adherence.
good,Wasn't too happy about management. Thought there was a lot of shadiness going on that wasn't addressed. Felt a lot of times management didn't hear me out on things i had a problem with.
good,If you are a set scheduled kind of person. This isn’t for you ! Your schedule will be different every week and it is hard to plan your life. Have a structured availability for them to work with but remain flexible.
good,They are hiring a mass amount of people bc they took on a new client and don’t have enough employees. The new client requires tenure agents so you’ll be trained fast and then be switched in 6mos to fit “business needs”. Looooots of favoritism shown! We are definitely UNDER paid and over worked and then the new policy taking away our $1.
good,"If you are a single person without a family this would be a great fit for you. Be wary though, there is much inconsistency with field leadership but if you're lucky you may end up working for someone engaging and inspiring and even compassionate!"
good,"The pay is not great, nor are their benefits. Overall, they are a company with good values etc, but retail pharmacy particularly does not pay well and they don't offer a lot of opportunities for advancement"
good,Schedule was all over the place couldn’t have time with my family the job role is on  pilot So you could get laid off any minute of the day if they terminate the job role
good,Manager consistently lied and was not very flexible to work with or talk to. Always talked down to people instead of having a conversation with them. Treated staff poorly
good,"Good job to get experience, but not the best company to work long time for. Management is too busy trying to satisfy corporate's demands by meeting numbers. Employees are not well taken care of."
good,"I have been with CVS for almost 17 years and the company has evolved a lot in terms of patient care, system integration and enhancements, acquisitions of Target, Omincare and Aetna. I really believe in the company's mission of helping people on the path to a better health, however recently after the merger with Aetna and CVS caremark, the company has become very profit and sales driven and has forgotten the value of their people. The leadership channel is constantly changing and bringing in more demand and pressure on the employees to perform and deliver results without proper staffing and by cutting payroll hours."
good,"The job itself was fine and nothing was overly difficult or taxing. The store I worked in was relatively consistent with sales and consistency of ""busy"" hours. As time went on though it became apparent the new management was poorly decided upon and tasks were divided unfairly and people were not disciplined in failing to complete tasks which resulted in extra work for others. I loved the job and the customers, mostly all the time. My location was just poorly managed and in the end I moved on to seek something better."
good,"Working in a CVS retail store as a pharmacist is extremely stressful most days.  Frequently one is required to not only perform the duties of a pharmacist, but also of a technician, cashier, and sales associate.  "
good,"The management and pharmacy staff were very nice and accommodating. However, Corporate doesn't really care about customer or employee relations. It's all about making a profit. Overworked and understaffed. But, if you like getting in hours it's okay."
good,"Often understaffed, management was tough but efficient. Co-workers were focused and did their job well. Consistent work, but lacked additional hours for staff."
good,"There's always some not so great days due to patient interaction but it's not that big a deal most of the time. The make or break of this job is the people that surround you. As a technician there's not much room for growth but as a pharmacist, the job isn't so bad so long as you can hire people that stay and work hard which is not easy."
good,It is a good place to start. Management is something to be desired. ( Not good). Mandatory overtime during peak that also carries over way past the end of peak. Heavy turnover. Employees are unhappy.
good,The work is very easy. The only problem I had here was constant and unending overtime. Plan for 5am-3pm Monday - Saturday. Also instead of scheduling overtime in advance they tell you what you are working tomorrow as leave every day.
good,Working for CVS has been a rollercoaster ride. It definitely has its ups and downs especially working in the pharmacy. I love helping people however the work culture can feel like high school at times
good,"very fast paced environment. heavy workload with very little assistance. pharmacy team has to make numerous phone calls throughout the day.  partners and co workers are normally easy to work with, and goal oriented"
good,"Overall CVS is a good Company,BUT They expect miracles from the store managers. There is not time away from the store. Even when you are gone, you get called to meetings, conference calls,  and they expect you to be there. "
good,"I started off up front then worked my way back to the pharmacy, when you first start working there they're really nice and willing to help you learn. But eventually they will start taking advantage of you and what you're willing to do. If you work there be prepared to lose your job if you arent able to work every weekend."
good,"You will have lots of work to do, but you may not have enough help and hours to get the work done. CVS is always looking for ways to cut hours but the work load doesn't change."
good,"Long story short I was a very reliable and dependable Shift Supervisor, did everything the assistant manager did or was supposed to be doing, also had 2 degrees at the time of my interview but still was paid minimum for my  shift supervisor position and didn’t receive a raise until I gave my two weeks notice. They didn’t want me to leave, they knew I was a great supervisor but didn’t pay me what I was worth."
good,"This company gives an employee the chance to learn several skills, but they do not fairly compensate internal hires promoting to new positions. Also, this company places a lot of responsibility on it's front line call takers, and expects them to not be disgrunted when other similar employers are compensating their employees to peform less functions. Promotions were rare, unless there was an overwhelming need to hire. Most times, employees were moved into an interim role for much longer than the 6 month maximum. Again, the experience gained is immeasurable, but they compensation received was extremely low if moving up within the company."
good,"Life in the role, sitting in one area answering phones that have a repeated script on the back line. Every call is virtually the same. However the people are OK to chit chat with, but the management I am not a fan of. It was a lot of misguided instructions. People were unaware of updates in policies or advancement options. Even though there were tough obstacles the job was enjoyable due to the people."
good,"A typical day for a cashier involved quickly, accurately, and politely handling a customer's service request. In addition, a cashier processes photo orders, handles telephone calls, reloading of Visa/MC, etc., Moneygram transactions and more. I found this position interesting because there was always something new to learn. The manager in the store that I worked ran a tip top, tight ship. However, I felt that the corporation really didn't communicate well with their employees and almost seemed to be indifferent to our existence. For me, the long hours on my feet became a problem. The constantly changing shifts were also very difficult for me."
good,"I’ve been with them for almost six years, decent enough company. Structure dependent on manager, can be good or really bad. Lately their have been tons of hours cut at the retail stores and it has been super hectic."
good,Cvs has its ups and downs. The team I worked with was really supportive but as a company they suck. Not enough hours or employees. They complain when you try to do your job and make the customer happy.
good,Cvs was okay nothing to really complain about. Your average retail job. Improves your customer service and you get extra bucks. Stocking was slot of work but worth it.
good,"I really wanted to like cvs health. I went in expecting to spend the rest of my life there, but cvs does not treat you well - the most terrible aspect is the pay (and it’s hard to move up). I started there making 30k in an entry level accounts payable position. After 3 years I was making 42k in as mid level, financial/accounting analyst role."
good,"No work day was the same.  It got to be a job of quantity, and not quality.  They wanted more nothing was never satisfying.  Upper management had no clue what a work day consist of.  The benefits were great like the flex card, vision and dental benefits were wonderful. The medical deductible was a little steep."
good,"I really enjoy who i work with and my customers, but the company keeps cutting hours so no one has a lot of hours. I've been there for a few years and every time I ask to go full time, I am told ""we can't afford it"". There are times when I only have 4 hours per week and I have to struggle to find shifts at other stores so I can pay my bills."
good,Workload is not worth the pay. they always cutting hours and still require the same work out of you. Its no longer fun. Cashier are paid a good wage though.
good,CVS was worried more about their bottom line than their employees. I was held up at gunpoint six times in the 14 years I worked overnight. They never once said thank you or ask if we were alright.
good,I did not have fun working here at all. Most days were slow and the environment wasn't very enriching. Management wasn't very good and it always felt like nobody really cared.
good,I only liked helping people at this profession. My co-workers were very hard working individuals. We worked as a team. Which i liked very much. Its was one of the jobs that i had experienced that was so different.
good,Corporate cuts hours with no regard for how much work there is to be done but still demands high numbers. Expect to work alone for periods of time because there simply aren't enough hours for you to have a cashier all day
good,"Worked every holiday without option and hours no one else wanted. Not very flexible with moving to a different position. Opportunity to grow into the field of your choice was not an option."
good,Always working hard to make sure patients are receiving their medications in a timely manner and triaging any issues that may arise. Customers may always be disappointed about having a long wait but in the end they have the medications they need to better their path to health and excellence.
good,"It is a good job if the boss likes you. Store management is great, the bigger people are good if they like you. If not, woe to you. "
good,"Company is responsive to complaints/concerns raised yet no real changes seen during my time there; elevated 3 issues and although I did get calls regarding them, but Never received any resolutions and if the issues were resolved I wasn't informed about them."
good,"CVS is ok. They do try to put their customers/patients first, which is implemented in ways I don't personally like. They don't pay well but they have been very flexible with schedule"
good,"Good benefits, poor management. Angry customers with various illness. No time to care for patients as I would like. Company focused on numbers not care."
good,"Laid back, Slow paced which i liked , But when it got busy on the cash register i had to handle everything on my own. Which i didnt mind since i learned everything quick. There was no training provided so that was nice. I got blamed for things that were out of my control. Lack of communication from the manager's. The shift manager had a nasty attitude. Honestly don't know how she got hired as a manager. I would've stood longer if it wasnt for her cause it was honestly a peaceful environment. And i was appreciated for my hard work from the supervisor."
good,"Would only get 20 hours, asked for more but they would not allow, They have no  health benefits available for P-T employees, care only about numbers.."
good,I needed to make more money in order to support my family which is why I left.   It was stressfu sometimes especiallyas a pharmacy technitian.  Depending on who was a pharmacist you either learned more or no.
good,It is not good. Too many chiefs and not enough indians.Often found myself alone on the bridge line with 10-20 management types that actually prevented me from working the problem.
good,CVS does not care about its front store employees. It focuses all of its attention on the pharmacy and they are going to start phasing out the front store and move to pharmacies and minute clinics. This reflects on how they treat their front-store employees and the lack of caring.
good,"Store management is responsible for full unit operations including pharmacy operations/sales, however is not afforded any opportunity to address sales/operational issues."
good,"Over the years hours have been cut drastically. Can't keep new hires, management in the pharmacy is good, but they're constantly being over worked, by tech hours being cut more and more"
good,The time I spent working there had It's good time's and not so good time's. Just the management wasn't that good and made working there difficult cause of the percentage you had to meet there a week.
good,"CVS wasn't too bad only due to the people I worked with, but we were always short and never had hours even though we filled enough prescriptions to have more than we did. I'm not sure how the pay is now but when I worked their I was a lead tech only making 14 an hour until I threatened to leave and they boosted me to 17 then again to 19. I worked all day there sometimes because we were so short."
good,"The work place at cvs isn’t that bad. But they do cut hours a lot During summer and randomly. And the hiring process is  horrible. They try to"
good,"a typical day at work consisted of taking back to back calls on an inbound auto dialer, and most of the calls were from individuals who had not been educated on their employers insurance plan and the costs of prescriptions.  80% of the calls were people calling to yell and scream at you because they think that the company was the one who put their insurance in place, when it is their employer.  This was the hardest part of the job, other than the fact that I live over 50 miles away, driving one way to work.  Mandatory overtime is scheduled from January 1st, to the end of February, and you are not allowed to deviate from it.  Also, being a call center, I stayed constantly sick due to other individuals not washing hands after using the bathroom, and having hand dryers in their restrooms.  I worked for two different supervisors when I was there, and was told that I was not being switched to another team until the last minute when coming in to work one day.  Asking for days off in their system, is almost impossible because their system does not work right, and so you have to go through a supervisor manually to escalate, every single time.  You can flex your schedule, but it is not a guarantee that you will get the day off for a dr. appointment, even when you have PTO available to take. This job is not for everyone.  It is very demanding, and if you have any kind of anxiety of panick disorder issues, stay away from this place."
good,"Customer service would be the forefront of it all. Building the relationship with customers over time has been the best part of working there. During busier times will become very hectic, but still manageable if you are not new to working at a retail store."
good,"Working at CVS Health has provided me a great opportunity to build a strong foundation in my financial knowledge and use of many professional tools and services. Over the past few years I believe I have worked diligently on improving my time management skills, communication, and all facets of professional abilities. The culture however is still stuck in the 80s and room for growth is limited. Having worked for over 2 years although my roles and responsibilities have grown at an exponential rate my salary and title have not. CVS Health as an employer needs to do better in provide proper compensation and work-life balance."
good,"Everyone who works in Production at the distribution center has to maintain a 95% speed rate everyday. For example: Order Selectors (piece pickers) have to maintain a 95% speed and accuracy rate while at times, there can be several batches of totes on the floor in your way while you pick. (Each batch can have 40+ totes) You get 2 breaks a day at 22 minutes each... not really enough time to relax and eat food or use the bathroom. It's usually one or the other. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you clock out for the day, especially if it's payday. Other than that, the home/work life balance is horrible, you'll see your coworkers more than your family."
good,"My review is that i loved working for the company, but hours are cut too often. most employees have to look for a second job because of less hours. When i started working for CVS the hours were great. After a a month hours are down from 30 to 10 a week"
good,"With the technician hours being cut by more than 50% and target prescription budget increase, it is really hard to balance quality customer service and meeting metrics. I have to put in extra 10 hours a week unpaid in order to catch up with work flow."
good,Only problem I had was the work I was doing got to me on a emotional and mental level. I wanted to help people and just didn't feel like I was making a difference to anyone.
good,CVS has changed over the years and has moved away from a culture that supports and develops it employees to one that is focused on numbers and execution.
good,Awesome job.  Offers flexibility.  Many different job opportunities within the company.   Lots of on job training .  Good work ethics with management.
good,"Customers are angry and impatient, schedules are somewhat flexible if you give notice ahead of time, workload is heavy and dealing with insurance companies is incredibly tedious and stressful and well above the pay grade you get."
good,"Do not notify if contract would be renewed.  Also unwilling to be flexible with people disability going to frequent Dr. Appointments ."
good,"While I enjoy working with my coworkers the company does not care about their employees. Dramatic cut in hours with no notice, lack of compassion for emergencies, paid sick days are almost impossible to get even though you have them. Overworked technicians and pharmacists"
good,"working with a good team,vary stressful on holydays neeed tochange  the policy of hiring by giving the employee the chance to voice opinions other than that is good company to work with"
good,customer care was not the biggest concern.  more concerned with how many customer you got off the phone than with how the customer was treated. feeling rushed all the time
good,"Work life balance is hard to manage. Typically work past scheduled hours all the time. Overtime is basically mandatory, you're never asked if you can stay when your a closer. Better communication is needed between departments."
good,I appreciate the opportunity CVS gave me when I first graduated from Pharmacy school with no experience. I had fun working with my colleagues and technicians
good,Overall the managers of each department were not trained to do the job in which they managed. Mangers could not assist in all daily duties or provide instruction on new assigned task.
good,Benefits and pay you get from years of working at CVS make up for the tiring hard work hours but you'll have to work a minimum of 5 years for any of that to seem worth it in my opinion.
good,"CVS Health pays relatively well, though not exactly for the area. New Jersey is an expensive state to live in. However, the work is very demanding, and it does not end. These physical positions are not jobs that just anybody can do, at pretty much any level in the building. The time spent training is too short, and the training itself it rather ineffective. Beware before signing up. I've worked for worse companies, but I've also worked for much better."
good,CVS as a whole has a good idea of what they want to be as a company. Hours are the biggest detriment to workflow and job satisfaction as well as patient safety.
good,Good company to work for if you like them taking away hours and don't handle conflict well. Poor management and poor communication! A lot of compliance modules and new rules each year.
good,"When I first started we had a crew that really gelled together, it was like a true family.  With the right crew you can have the worst day and it will still be enjoyable.  However, three years into employment the crew split up and went to different store, from that moment on CVS became unbearable for the amount they were offing to pay in compensation."
good,"fast pace, very hectic during certain hours. understaffed most of the time.  be prepared to work fast and hard. Stand a lot and always on your feet. Won't be able to take breaks due to high volume of prescriptions to fill."
good,"At CVS, I was promoted to be a manager in a couple of months. I spent the next 2 years trying to get another promotion. Instead I spent my time training other managers who eventually moved on. I left due to lack of advancement opportunity."
good,"Working at Coram has taught me may things but it was also extremely stressful. most positive aspect was interacting with the patients verbally on phone calls to set them up with the company. But, Coram can also be extremely stressful and you may have to end up working over schedule times a lot."
good,I was hired on at CVS as a Technician Most of the staff was pleasant the management team did not communicate with new staff as must and kind of stand offish did not small must to new staff only friendly with staff that worked permanently. CVS cut staff hours so staff felt less work needed to be done and new staff should carry most of the load. The evening shift was the hardest because it would be less staff and more work left from the morning shift then work that need to be done on evening shift. CVS had some good pharmacist that worked with their technicians and helped out when work fell behind. I really enjoyed working with some of the technicians at night we had good conversation and great laugher.
good,"The job is a good experience but depending on location. if its a very very busy location, you tend to not learn to fast and efficient. other than that, it isn't such a bad place to work or get your experience."
good,"Typical day at work is logging in and getting on the phones depending on the day I would be on my dedicated line or general plan line. 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch breaks. I learned that people are pretty mean and not willing to listen. I learned how to deescalate situations. I didn't even know who my manager was so I have no idea what the manager was like. Supervisor wise they're alright. Mine was pretty busy every once in a while they'd be able to talk to you, but if you're on the phone you never know when you'll get a call. The culture was pretty dull, no one really wants to be there, but the money is okay. They try to have events, but no one knows the nature of the event or can't get off work for the event. Every once in while there would be a putlock, but that's at your own expense. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the fact that you're always under appreciated and they don't really care about you. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping someone get their medication approved. Wouldn't recommend working here unless if you really need  the money."
good,"Enjoyed greeting customers. having small conversation and helping them with their needs.  I  thrive on keeping busy, multitasking and just accomplish as much as I can without over working myself."
good,"Learned a lot about medications and prescriptions. Retail isn't that great but it is retail so it's what it is - good people, bad people. Coworkers generally were helpful but never seemed too happy that they must stop their own work to help out. Others just wouldn't help you or they wouldn't do their part of the job."
good,"Stick on a pace that your contible with, and that you can stick with it. It means if your a fast worker than you have to do it all day. But if you started fast than go slow that means that your number will be very low. "
good,"If you're going through a temp service CVS usually promises to hire you on full time after 3 months. I personally never saw it happen. Typical day consist of incoming and outbound calls. Hardest part of job is if you make an error, senior reps or management wait days before bringing it to your attention. Then actually expect you to remember specific calls out of the many you get in a days time. They cover one thing in training then when you make it to the floor you find things are done totally different, with the exception of how to answer calls. General work environment is nice. However management and training could be better. Most enjoyable part is the feeling you get when you're actually able to help someone with their issue."
good,This company is going through a lot of changes and I've learned not to put all my eggs in one basket because of this company.  The co-workers were a joy to be with on a typical day at work.
good,Wait til a manager point out what needed to be done. There wasn't any job titles being given to Seasonal employee Managers were lazy often but there isn't much work either way
good,screwed me on hours and benefits. they are an over priced corporation with not much empathy for their employees. i was grateful to work a decent location but the corporation as a whole is a no for me.
good,"There were a few senior employees that did not work well with newer employees. The pharmacists were so busy, they were the supervisors, but really did little to create a team environment."
good,"Retail does not have the best schedule. Many metrics that are hard to hit. Not always supported by management, since their workload is also heavy. Need to attract better technicians by increasing wages."
good,CVS does not value work life balance. Constant calls after hours and on weekends prevents family time with loved ones and leaves me with an increase in tension and stress.
good,"Filling prescriptions, running the pharmacy ,communication skills among staff, customer care, counseling patients about prescriptions and over the. Counter meds"
good,It was highly stressful but the compensation was great. There was constantly an issue of being understaffed because the company would not give more hours to employees.
good,"Worked there for almost 2 years. Most of it was under 1 manager, but constant new staff and assistant managers. First manager was absolutely wonderful and the best boss I've ever worked for; but quit very suddenly. New manager was horrible and seemed very sexist. No one higher up would do much. Forced me to find work elsewhere. I went from supposed to be being promoted and working 30-40 hours a week... to getting one 6 hour shift a week IF I was lucky. "
good,"CVS isn't a terrible place to work for a minimum wage paying job. management wasn't the best, pay wasn't the greatest, especially bi-weekly. Corporate cares more about customers than employees which made the job a bit harder."
good,"typical work day you would have members call in for refills on mail orders for their prescriptions. and provided information on the insurance plan on how it will plan and the difference in deductible, co-pay, or maximum out of pocket expense. So that the member is aware of the cost. There are a vast number of Federal Regulations and plan regulations you must follow and notify the member on what is the plan they chose and what restrictions there are. Teamwork lacks a great deal other than that a good place to work at. Provided if you can adapt to the stress level and all the rules"
good,"Ever changing schedule, no work life balance.  you have to work evenings and weekend and holidays, but that is retail. The rate of pay is low for the pressure and timing of the work load."
good,My experience working with CVS was productive and fast-paced. I really enjoyed working for CVS most of the time. I floated between two stores and liked the change of environment every couple of days and each location had its own challenges to tackle.Downside (like many other chains) Hours and shifts do get split quite a bit so the lead tech can make do with the hours allotted to each store. I would have stayed with CVS for a much longer span of time if I hadn't made the decision to move on to another prospective tech position.
good,"CVS health is a typical retail pharmacy setting. In my opinion, there is a lot of unnecessary intervention coming from the district office aside from the overall goal, helping people on their path to better health."
good,"Cooperate company that doesn't pay enough attention to its employees. more worried about numbers. Easy job, with the right team. and management that makes sure his team is taken care of, so they can reciprocate that same care to the customers"
good,Technician hours are cut often and there seems to never be enough employees to cover shifts.  Pharmacist are overworked and do a lot of technician work such as answer phones and help with drive-thru and registers.
good,"Stressful, work loads unreasonable, Management was not professional, had performance reviews that were left up to personal opinions instead of proven performances."
good,"CVS Health has a lot of opportunities for job advancement. They have an overwhelming amount of tolls and resources available for career training and advancement,"
good,CVS is a good company to work for but very stressful environment. Accessive work load each day. If you work in a average CVS is only two employee in the morning and two employee in the evening not enough hours are given to scheduled more help if needed.
good,"As an employee, you are aware of the vastness of the company as a whole.  The daily work demand is extreme for the limited amount of employees on hand."
good,"Working at CVS is no picnic. You start off in a picker/packer position where you are required to fill orders for the stores. You must pick at a certain speed (maintain a 95%) while also making sure you are picking correctly (98% accuracy). Not enough time is given in most areas of the warehouse to make sure you are picking everything and picking it correctly. When you mess up you receives coachings, verbals warnings, and written warning. If your performance does not improve, you are terminated. "
good,"CVS is just like any other big business; profit is their motivation. The patient (customer) and employees are not a priority. Yes, the government is playing a big part in pharmacy, which leads to more unhappy patients. The pharmacist is in charge of all technicians in the pharmacy. Unfortunately, they are human and get tired, overworked and burnt out. Mainly, the patient interacts with the technicians; but, the pharmacist has to be the one to verify the prescription, call the doctor for verification, etc. So, the time to wait is longer than quoted time and the pharmacist is too busy to call every patient to let them know. The patient gets angry and takes it on on the technician all because the final step is verification by the pharmacist. If there is no good pharmacist, there will not be a good technician(according to the patient). Please do not compare a fast food drive thru with a pharmacy drive thru."
good,"MTC, branch of Pharmacy Advisor."
good,"Management sucks"
good,A typical work day would be is to show up and be mostly behind the register and ring up customers. Every once and awhile I would get to go to the back and do other assignment like inventory. Doing inventory was defiantly much better than standing up at register because I get to scan and put items out on the floor and organizing them. Management was change every so often but it was average. The most enjoyable about my job was organizing the items on truck day and on inventory day.
good,The organization was not at all interested in the employees. They were not receptive to the ideas and input from the front line employees who actively completed the work. It was a 'do as I say' culture and not receptive to any suggestions for how their hard line approach made it difficult to complete the work to meet the KPI's.
good,"The staff for the most part was a pleasure to work with, but with time changes were made that greatly caused a decline in the work environment and the overall company."
good,"Being a pharmacy technician came naturally to me. I knew the ins and outs of how to fill prescriptions timely and accurately, find the medication needed and double count the medications, to then give to the Pharmacist for QA. I was really good with customers and they were blown away that I took to much effort into helping them out. But there is usually one co-worker who will bring you down and tell you that what I am doing is wrong, even though I knew otherwise. One Pharmacist never appreciated how quickly and accurately that I could fill those prescriptions, and it showed."
good,CVS Health attempts to create a balanced work/home life. They provide adequate health based services and decent perks to be able to do your job while maintaining your personal and social health.
good,"If you are someone who is frequently ill, this job might not be for you. Very strict attendance policy and you can't just take in your doctor excuse afterwards. It's a very long process to get your absences forgiven. I became more stressed out about this process and made myself more sick!"
good,"This is an ok place for pharmacy technicians to work, the pay is not that great and it is hard to work your way up. Just gain some experience and move on."
good,"I work art different CVS locations and based on the store, the workflow can change."
good,"My most recent position lasted 4 years and was a work from home position.  I knew what reports were due and worked on the timely completion of those reports on a daily basis.  I worked on downloading data for those reports, upgrading processes in my databases for those reports, uploading data into my MS Access databases for those reports, checking the calculations, reconciling data, generating charts and tables, and transferring data to the appropriate PowerPoint presentations for each report."
good,I enjoyed working there. Had a great supervisor but  other management needs to be more mature and handle criticism better. We aren't in high school anymore.
good,Very disappointed in the management and how the flow in the pharmacy was. It was always unorganized and I did not like it at all. They are my least favorite company.
good,Been going through a lot of changes in management and just gave everyone raises. You have two 20 min break in which the company pays for. They have two shifts and part time pisitions
good,"I've learned how to multi task really well and how to maintain calm in a stressful situation. I work by myself with only a manager or supervisor that I hardly see. I always work Fridays and Saturdays which are the most stressful with doing truck and signs. On Friday we hurry to do as much stocking as possible since the truck came in. On Saturday we continue to do truck and then we also take off sale signs throughout the whole store. This is all with the added pressure of running register and phone, helping customers, translating since I'm bilingual, cleaning, and organizing. Sometimes I feel the workload is a little unfair, but I do enjoy my team. The people I work with are a family and it does make working there more enjoyable."
good,"They don't hire security, the job sucks! It is a job, but dealing with crazy people and low pay do not mix well! Don't work in a bad part of town, you'll realize fast how much CVS ""cares"" about you as an employee. They schedule when they need you even if you request a set schedule. Your hours will be cut! At first they will train you good, then you have to pick up hours at different stores to work a full 40 hours, they will never give you 40 hours. NEVER! This company is a good job to start, if you want to learn the basics, start here because you can only upgrade from this job."
good,"I think CVS is not fair at least the one in Pleasant grove . They hired new employees and cut my hours"
good,"Hours are cut left and right, new hire contracts are only good for a year so the hours you were promised then are not a guarantee. It's a nice place to work if you are lucky enough to have great coworkers"
good,"You work 10 hour days a lot and then they cut your hours when there's not enough work. You only get one15 minute break and one 25 minute break. There is no job security because they play favorites and only promote those that kiss butt. They also let people go for not making rate, even those that have been there for years. These people are usually older and  they are the ones that work o.t. willingly/ have great attendance/ try their hardest. this is not a place you can retire at. It's a good job for someone young and someone who can do physical labor for 8 to 12 hours."
good,"Didn't really advance at Caremak. Job was based solely off productivity and quality. Didn't really really like the setup, but I understood why that was the process. Overall it was a good company to work for"
good,"I worked here 8 years and learned a lot, I am appreciative of the knowledge gained through CVS, because of that I was able to become certified, I worked with great people, however retail pharmacy can be hostile at times and no room for breaks, the work and life balance was off because of unstable schedules and the pay was not good."
good,"Very diverse work environment. High demand and high expectations. Always need to be on your game, CVS will only accept the best from its employees. If you cannot execute, then this is not the job for you."
good,"Be ready to help and collaborate with coworkers in the daily tasks  of running a pharrnacy which includes: pick up, drop-off, inventory and production"
good,"very busy, understaffed, not provided enough tech hours. have to work at least 2 13 hour shifts a week. have to use vacation time or make up shift even for mandatory meetings."
good,"Being a pharmacy technician means standing on your feet for 10 hours, doing all the work in preparing a prescription and getting paid very little.  This company would give 10 cent raises at a time."
good,"In regards to management, I was looking for more opportunity or support to work in production or drop off doing data entry to strengthen my skills. Especially, since I was formally trained prior to being hired and received my certification after working there for several months. While working there, I was enthusiastic to learn and dedicated to contributing to the team. I learned from daily activities such as refills through the phone and being taught through fellow and senior techs. I worked with a really great team. In summary, working there was a rewarding learning experience it is for those who like customer service and enjoy helping and caring for others and for that I'm grateful for my time with the company."
good,My last supervisor was awesome but she was limited in what she could do. CVS Silver Script training was HORRIBLE!!!!!! What you were trained on is NOT THE WORK YOU WERE DOING AFTER TRAINING!!!!!!! Yet you're being graded on what they didn't train you on and you could've been terminated based on your grades. Upper management knew it & they didn't care. From what my old coworker friends that are still employed there things are the same.
good,"Great place to work, but management could be impossible at times. The customers were my main priority, they were awesome and I really enjoyed trying to serve them."
good,CVS was hard work. Customers are typically rude. It is very busy. There were several pharmacy techs and regular employees that came in went. The management was mediocre. There were never enough people working.
good,An alright job if you're just trying to get by in school. I would not recommend this as a career choice. The pay is too low and the hourly cuts are high. The stress is immense with how short staff the pharmacy department is and no one is well trained. You are basically thrown into the wolves den with the little help that is given. I would implore you to reconsider before making this job choice.
good,"I think working retail is a very tedious and hard job, they should offer a higher pay, especially to the technicians. There are plenty of responsibilities that technicians do not get credit for."
good,While working for a year I never was offered to take classes to have a chance for a big promotion although I was promoted twice within departments. Billing dept was a nice place to work and mail sorting also.
good,"Work product expectations create a stressful, feeding-frenzy work environment leaving team members feeling frustrated and inept.  Management may offer help, but is actually very critical.  Going to Advice and Council or the Ethics Line only gives the employee a black mark and the ""no-retribution"" rule that's supposed to be in place, per the Code of Conduct, reads well, but does nothing in actuality.  I would hope that this is not CVS wide, but my experiences with CVS Corporate do not suggest that."
good,I don't really like it here. The store manager is very chauvinistic and pretty much just not nice at all. Treats me bad and makes me feel like I am not smart. That's why I am looking for another job now.
good,"Cvs was a great place to work, the main issues there is accountability. There are three shifts: Day, evening, and overnight. You see what I call a trickle down system of responsibilities happening. Day and evening shifts are only about 6 to 8 hours long, so when they dnt get finished with something or decide they don’t want to do it , it ends up on overnight’s list. The problem with that is, the overnight list is already twice as long and the average list, plus the added other shifts leftovers. You are then held responsibile for someone else’s work . Overnight is also responsible for unloading trucks, stocking shelves,and removals and placement of all sales tags, meanwhile the other two shifts have busy work and usually have atleast 3 to 4 people working at one time. You only have two people working at night regardless of how much needs to be done."
good,"Fun place to work, coworkers are amazing. As with any major corp the uppers don't know what the lowers are doing. This is nothing new. But it it is a great way to gain experience, the do pay to train."
good,"It was okay, It was not a good fit for me. They understaff and overschedule. Getting time off was nearly impossible, very fast paced and I recieved very poor job training."
good,"This place isn't great and it isn't awful. The job can be stressful due to how much you are responsible for and how busy it gets. It also really depends on who your lead pharmacist is. One pharmacist is fantastic to work with and I respect him a lot, the other is condescending and expects way too much of the worker and makes me dread each shift with her. The job itself is alright, personally I find it not to be a good match for me because it's stressful and there's too much customer facing responsibilities in the job for me."
good,"This is an entry level job into a office work.  It's not hard but it is essentially still retail work.  You'll answer phones from shift start to shift end and handle customers who have already been upset by the store staff.  You'll get all the problems and be expected to turn those problems into solutions that the company doesn't offer you paths or tools to locate.  Overall the internal workings of the company are struggling with software from the 90's and a cut-throat idea of how to handle its customers.  The call center culture is sort of like a casino where everyone is potentially stealing time rather than cheating or stealing.  You're timed on everything, including restroom breaks and the offer virtually no practical training for fulfilling your job.  So make sure you have some good problem resolution and self-training skills already."
good,"typical call center, inbound call regarding pharmacy benefits for BCBS members. overall good management. the job can be either relaxed or stressful depending on call volume. do not like being stuck to a phone or expected to  go to lunch/ break at the same exact time daily or not  being able to use the restroom or get something to drink without someone telling me im not on break."
good,"While there are good managers who take the time to get to know and understand their employees, this place has constant cuts so no job security and upper management in oblivious to the work being done by the cogs of this corporate machine. They treat employees like numbers, not like people, and it is hard to work for a company like that even if you are one of the good ones because they crush you until you conform to their ways."
good,Overall I loved my job. I was in school to be a CPHT at the time so working there helped a lot because of how much I learned. A typical day at work would be very busy and fast paced which I think is any pharmacy although we were consistently short staffed. The hardest part of the job was the days we didn't have enough techs to properly take care of customers in a timely fashion. Management was awesome and did their best to step in and help when they could.
good,I have surely enjoyed my time at CVS without a doubt. I loved all of my coworkers and managers as we worked very well together and always got everything done early. Just wish they paid more so I can live off it.
good,"difficult"
good,"Working for cvs was okay however there pay sucks and if youre not full time you get no benefits but they will allow you to work full time hours,,,smh cvs"
good,I love what I do but I feel like the management could be tighter and I feel that staff is underpaid. The work evnironment is fast paced and can sometimes be chaotic.
good,"Constant updates to protocols, procedures, enhancements, trainings, initiatives to stay modern and competitive.  Senior management was changed for 2018, not all districts have a district manager that is a pharmacist"
good,"stressful, long hours"
good,I love my job but the hours keep getting cut back and more work added to our already long list of things we need to do. Our current PIC is not very encouraging and can be a downer. I was given atlas 4 raises but I just can't do the negativity and long shifts.
good,"Very fast paced, many rules and regulations to follow. Training is ggod and you get paid to train. May move you to other locations if needed, so be prepared."
good,Not worth the stress to work full time. Rather work part time and get paid whatever the pay is because it’s not great and hard to get a raise there st times.
good,"As someone who love my community and is dedicated to the progress of the healthcare system, the essence of my job with CVS Pharmacy is nothing short of rewarding. The management hierarchy though has proved itself to be uncaring for its employees at the store level and has no desire to see individuals improve in anything other than numbers."
good,"Management is not reasonable in the inbound dept, It's a lot of favoritism there with management. Not paid for what you're worth. No room for growth. The job is stressful but pay is okay with overtime."
good,Due to so many changes within the management team. Things are not what they once were which makes it very difficult to work as a team and be productive.
good,"EXACTLY WHAT THE TITLE SAYS !!!!!! I believe it was the manager however, she just didn't know how to interact with the employees even though she was sometimes accommodating at times."
good,"Pharmacist and tech support usually good but direct managers varied in their skill level and support  or non support. Many rules to follow and if not to the letter, petty managers issued threatening penalties."
good,this job is okay. After a few weeks you will have mastered this job. CVS does little to keep there employees interested in there job if they are not in pharmacy. Mangers do not have very good training on how to interact porperly with either employees
good,"Pressure to do 10 hours work in 8 hours. Overtime potentially possible but not allowed."
good,"Pharmacy nowadays is not what it used to be just 10 years ago when I first started. I got into the pharmacy field because I loved the idea of helping people feel better. I don't like how corporate greed has weaseled themselves in, and make this all about money. There are never enough hours in the day to do what is asked of us every day."
good,"You can imagine, people are funneled into the business unwillingly based on negotiated contracts behind closed doors . It's just a corporate monster. It will eat you."
good,"I worked at CVS Health for many years and worked on improving my personal development as best and as much as I could. I forced myself to love the job I was doing and tried to explore different career positions until finally I said to myself that was enough When I tried to apply/explore for different positions,.their indirect message was practically "" Shut up...you're fine where you are""...so no different position. The work environment was very much dry, private and weird. The communication team were not really clear. I grateful and thankful for the moments that I had at CVS Health mail order; However, I am so happy that I left."
good,"CVS is a decent company,but very stressful place to work. They are all very understaffed, they put a lot of work on the little techs they do have and they don't try to offer any type of raise or compensation. Me personally I am 4 months pregnant, I would like to advance to something a little different, office like, and less stressful. I want to be able to see my daughter and help her with homework, as well as remain healthy and stress free for my new arrival"
good,"As an employee of CVS, I worked in the photo department. The company provided training for about two weeks, before leaving me alone in that department."
good,The company has a moderate appeal. The benefits are good enough to stay with the company. Management is like any other company some are good and some are bad. Typical day is answering phone calls all day for the full 8 hours. Lately a lot of quality scoring changes have occurred making phone calls being critiqued to hard.
good,"I started here in Oct 2015 and when I got the job I was super excited.Training is hard to get through. They are more concerned with getting people in and out, like an assembly line, they don't really stop to answer questions. When you get on the production floor, its a learn-as you go process. You learn more from your co-workers then any of the trainers. Once you get the hang of it, its not hard. There are a lot of gaps that are left open that you just learn to fill in. The call center is all incoming. "
good,"It is a production environment, so you MUST be on time clocking in, on time clocking out, etc.   People are written up often.  Management does not keep their word re: promotions."
good,"In Davidson, NC there is Davidson College and lots of elderly residents in the area that keep that location busy, busy, busy! Very fast-paced and you are lucky to get your breaks."
good,"As a technician, we are expected to multitask but sometimes its so busy that is not possible without making an error.  Many leave because the workload and stress is not worth what we get paid. Especially when our front store clerks make more, but do way less."
good,"I have no problems doing my duties as a pharmacy tech, what bothered me was that i never received my benefits and the company knew from the start that i needed health benefits due to a chronic disorder i have in my stomach. I was given the look around over and over with the district manager and the regional manager and including HR. Its a fast pace and can be hectic/stressful. Management was horrible, some stores dont have enough people to help run it so the number are low and so are the ratings due to the same reason. So management send techs that are already used to their store and send them to other stores and never get a simple thank you or any kind of acknowledgment. As long as Roger is managing the store pharmacies, hes never going to get the numbers together and blame the Pharmacist in charge like its the pharmacy's fault that they dont have a full staff when hes the one that wont let employees get over time to help or to hire new techs. Like i said poor management"
good,I was happy at first but then working there I realized it was a job not for me leadership is unprofessional and  not on the same page a big mistake I made to work here
good,"As a new employee you would be working the register almost all the time. You rarely get to work with the actual medicine and healthcare aspect. There seemed to be a decent form of employee turnover. I was hired as part time yet was working 40+ hours a week. At first it was ok since it was the summer, however later on when school started they were reluctant and seemed disappointed that i needed more time off."
good,"Typical day was working with insurance companies and customers. Workplace culture was diverse. Not much opportunity to interface with team members because of constant phone work. Again, management kept changing and never had the opportunity to work with team leader and give suggestions for job imporovement."
good,"I worked for a call center, fast paced customer service job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the clients and helping them receive a satisfactory answer when calling the help center."
good,"If you are looking for a part-time job while i school then CVS is fine, however there is no room for advancement even if you were to take on a full-time position. The pay is not competitive and the amount of work that is asked of you grows considerably."
good,CVS Pharmacy demands too much of retail pharmacy staff. I am concerned about the lack of technician help provided to Pharmacists. This creates a stressful environment which impacts service and patient safety.
good,"I loved the job until I was terminated while ideas on a sick leave, and my supervisor left for another job at thensamr time I was on my leave of absence. I was never able to get a conformed answer with human resources, and I never received paperwork from them confirming my job no longer available. To me that is very unprofessional."
good,I have enjoyed my time working at CVS Health it is a face paced working environment that experiences a lot of change. I am looking  to find a different employer to advance my skills
good,"I can’t say everything bad about this is CVS fault. Retail is just not a pleasant place to work as a pharmacy tech. However, like pharmacist who receive the highest salary for working retail vs hospital or inpatient, the same should go for techs. The pay should be more competitive."
good,It is very silent atmosphere. You can wear your headphones while you process medical claims. hardest part is finding the correct information to process your claim.
good,Very stressful work environment. I liked that the work day went by quickly due to the fast paced environment. But corporate was always on our backs and cared more about money than the customer or the employee
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, excelentes companeros de trabajo, excelente store manager"
good,"I would recommend this position as a first job. Not career material. Also, if you are looking for good pay, this is not the job for you. There are good managers and bad managers so overall, I would give them a 3."
good,"Advancing in the company is very difficult.  Too many people applying for the same position and Not able to hire all.  I love working there, but again we all need to grow.  Growing is not about experience here.  if you are needed in your position that you are in, you will not be promoted to another position."
good,"As a MIT, I was not really using any of my leadership skills to really improve the bottom line, or manage people; as there was only one other person I would work with during the day, and, for the most part, we were ringing customers. Lack of depth and innovation.Task oriented, which these tasks were redundant and lacked creativity."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you are looking for a pharmatical career, but working in the actual store is average. No good pay, no benefits, no paid vacation time."
good,"At CVS pharmacy, you will be expected to work hard, and always be on the ball. Once you get over the learning curve, the job becomes nearly second-nature and you become part of a team."
good,you have to see it to believe it. It has a set of core values that are one of a kind there are about six weeks of training that is forever evolving. good luck
good,"Just your average pharmacy/retail store. it would be like Walgreens. I would come in, clock in , and get on the register. I would start doing my assignments such as getting tags ready , or stocking candy, and other goods on the floor, or behind the counter. Ringing up customers, taking customers to the aisles for assistance. I would do a variety of jobs every day."
good,"Even though I liked my co-workers and pharmacist manager, the management wasn't great. It was old fashioned and I always had to remind the pharmacist the days I took off. Because scheduling was made by paper, I had to request days off by text or in person, which was fine. The problem was that because the pharmacist was always busy, they always forget to mark it."
good,There are two shifts and the work is not balanced fairly among them. Plainly management doesn't care!! Not enough employees and very long shifts. Terrible!!!
good,They need to focus more on training people and being open to new ideas. They can't make the employees feel neglected and making them feel like they only have stupid ideas.
good,"The company expects stores to run on a super tight payroll( i.e.: 2 employees only on one shift to work the entire store as well as cashier) and expects the employees to achieve unobtainable goals for the time allowed. That was just in the front of the store. In the pharmacy it was worse. I would see Techs leaving the building on a frequent basis stressed out, near tears,or ready to snap at any minute. I worked in different districts in different states and no matter what the volume of the store I always felt we were always 2 bodies short to have just an OK day towards task accomplishment."
good,It is a very stressful place to work.  It's very busy and they are under staffs.  They concerned more about Over Time than making sure everything go smooth.
good,"Faced paced, learning environment for employees. Opportunity for mentorship and development. The harderst part of the job is understanding products and services offered."
good,One must be able to stand for one's entire shift. No exceptions. It is isn't easy especially since some days can be long and quite busy. The customers in the area in which I worked were very combative and it requires extra patience. You must really enjoy serve your customers/patients
good,"managers always have closer bonds with veteran employees who have a few years under their belt.  Pharmacists lack knowledge of common medications; you are unable to help anyone out. your assigned a task of finding prescription cards, but you can only do that, and when asking questions, you get a nasty response, and the company is ok with this going on as I spoke up many times, but like I said, if your a veteran of many years, you get an ok to do what you want (and I am not meaning US Veteran.)"
good,"The pay rate is better some other companies, but scheduling was inconsistent. One week, you might be scheduled for 16 hours (two 8-hour days back-to-back) and then the next week you might be scheduled for 40 hours. Then the third week, you might only get one 4-hour shift for the entire week. Cash register training was good, but there was not enough training and supervision for stocking merchandise. If questions were asked, employees were often treated like they should have already known the answer and they were wasting a supervisor's time. Most of the managers also rarely spent any time on the sales floor and had to be called for assistance."
good,I advanced quickily in my positions and feel I was a great team player and working at CVS really improved my retail background and some management experience.
good,"long hours, stressful and not very good insurance/"
good,"I've learned a lot in my years with CVS. It has offered me the opportunity to grow in the medical/pharmaceutical field, which allows me to offer more to my Veterinary position."
good,"if you don't ruffle feathers, they WILL use you up. If you need or want something, make a big stink about it. Turnover rate is unbelieveable even at management positions. Management frequently leaks confidential information, Employee unaware of most store/company policies. Most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with the customers, positive or negative, always an enjoyable experience. Maybe that was just because I'm awesome at neutralizing situations."
good,Working for CVS as a pharmacy tech will vary upon location. The locations I worked were very busy and fast paced. It was exhausting work but rewarding (in that you can quickly build friendly relationships with coworkers and customers). The pay and benefits will also vary. Working hours can very greatly from week to week depending on location and demand.
good,This job has its pros and cons like every job has but my issue was the pay didn't match up with the amount of work that we were expected to do. This is why the company has a big turnover
good,"Faced paced environment, High employee turn over. Change in procedure at all times. Overtime is available during the bust time of the year, Not enough training"
good,"My experience was very good, Hr needs improvement. Corporate culture. No events were organized to bring the staff togather. Lack incentive for technicians"
good,"If you work on and around the strip and in the Hospitality Casino industry, you will meet and work with people from all over the country.  Depending upon the store's locale it can be fast paced or slow.  This is based on the time of year.  If you can adapt, the work can be rewarding, however it is not meant for everyone.  You will develop the ability to multitask."
good,Pace is fast and you have to be a quick leaner. Work is detailed. Good customer service is key. I greet everyone and treat each customer with dignity and care.
good,"at CVS pharmacy, they do not care about you. they hire you as a part time worker, so they do not have to give you benefits or vacation time. they also make you work short hours like 3 to 5 hours a day everyday instead of a more secure schedule. my personal pharmacy manager was incredible and I love her dearly, but the store manager, she was horrible. I learned a lot at CVS but with no benefits and no time off, it was doomed. they don't believe in treating people like humans, we are just another number to them"
good,"The particular location I work for is certainly not for everyone. It is the busiest pharmacy in the district and we are not only short staffed, but we also have call outs often. I constantly do the work of 2 or 3 people at once. The company is an okay company to work for but I wouldn't recommend my store in particular to anyone."
good,"Too little pay, asked to work OT and not paid for it. Not even sure that's legal. Not enough staff to cover peak periods. Technicians and pharmacists at times completely overwhelmed."
good,"It was a good job and i enjoyed my coworkers. For the responsibility, fast paced, nonstop work I don't feel as though CVS really cares to compensate accordingly."
good,"the pay was low but then i had zero experience so that is expected."
good,"Team mates are great people and the company benefits are pretty good but even that has started to be cut back.  No investment in education yet they want you to be innovative.  Also no time to try anything new nor can you install any software to evaluate it.  Red tape has become a nightmare.  Over the last few years I feel like a glorified administrative assistant filling out forms, chasing people and emailing and attending conference calls.  What happened to actually developing something useful?  Sad....but I haven't learned anything new in about 8 years now."
good,"The culture at CVS is not a good one.  There are no benefits and no job security.  However, the people are very nice and a joy to work with.  Nice work life balance in the summer months."
good,"The manager was very unorganized. The schedule was not clear and the PIC kept switching. The pay is very low compare to what you have to do at work. Depend on the location you work, but the location I worked at was very busy and stressful."
good,"I would have love to keep my job however, the hours they were giving me did not fit with my family life and  as a mother of four that is most important. Also going on two years and still part time, no paid days off or vacation days."
good,"Many job positions are not properly filled, meaning the people with which you work are either underqualified or not qualified at all- and that's only who the company hires.  Many other spots go unfilled for months, leaving departments scrambling for assistance that they will probably never get.  If you work full-time, there is a opportunity for overtime, but if you have a family and/or value your free time, the hours you may need to work may completely go against your personal life."
good,"-A typical day at work consist of getting coolers ready, picking supplies, equipment, and drugs for patients, processing orders and filling out tickets, and receiving in supplies and drugs that come in."
good,I loved my job but the managers were horible.  The staff was wonderful.  We had alot to do and we never got to eat or use the bathrooms.  We had to break when the Dm was there but other wise we were working.  I was prego and worked. My dad past away and I worked.  All I did was work.
good,I don't have much of a review. I have been with CVS for four years and I do not think I am compensated entirely for my job and I will like to find a new one with stable hours.
good,"I enjoy helping others, whether it's customers or my peers. This was an excellent position for helping people on a daily basis. If I felt I would be able to progress further, I would stay."
good,"CVS is a good company to work for but just like every other good companies, they all have their downsides. At CVS there are too much to do with little or no help. They need to give their pharmacist more technicians to help them carry out and discharge  their duties."
good,"Day-to-day duties consist of filling prescriptions, checking for out-of-date medications, courtesy calls to customers regarding prescriptions, stocking supplies, ect. Overall work atmosphere is ok."
good,"Pay sucks and now so does the benefits. Around 15 of my coworker have lost their jobs this year. ""Nothing will change with the CVS merger"", haha. That was a lie."
good,"Only thing I like from this company is the wage, the job is very high maintenances, got an injury , was put on light duty while there was no light duty still have not recovered. Management is good , multiple jobs are better"
good,"If you really like learning new things, working and talking to people multiple times a day, answering phones and filling prescription orders then this is the job for you."
good,"management constantly talking badly about other employees. Not enough staff coverage to perform basic tasks. asked to work off the clock on 6 hour shifts as not incur a lunch penalty, but to help customers. no coverage for state mandated breaks."
good,"A good and stressful place to work without much chance of advancement most especially for those who are the face of the company, the clerks. Rain, snow or shine, they must report to work without RECOGNITION or Incentive !!!"
good,Decent Job. A lot of customer service and cashiering. Either it would be slow or it would be busy. Their is also physical labor involved when unloading a truck and packing out.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was providing excellent customer service.Just knowing I helped a sick person get what they need to feel better.I enjoying lending a handle to help others.
good,"Standing all day"
good,"Lack of communication between leadership, this includes directors, managers, trainers and supervisors. Retention is at an ultimate low. Additionally, training methodology needs improvement."
good,My position as a Pharmacy Technician was alright but at my store the weekends could be a bit rough. There were never enough technicians. Also there was always something being changed by corporate.
good,I learned a lot about working in pharmacy and the photo department. As well working up front as a Clerk. The crew there are amazing to work with. I've learned a lot about customer service.
good,"We Do not get paid enough for the amount of stress that we are under. It would be better if they,even slightly increased available hours but we're often stuck by ourselves."
good,"Good place to learn basic NP skills, diagnosis and treatment options, no real management, no sense of ownership or continuation of care with patients. Lack of support staff makes our job seem less important, the NP does the registration, money collecting, cleaning, everything,"
good,I was able to work with this company right after giving birth to my son.  It worked out then until he got older and it became hard ton be at family functions.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you want to have a balance work life. It's Monday thru Friday, no holidays, no weeks and if your lucky no nights (nights are 12 pm to 8:30 pm)."
good,"Don't care for store management. Can't deal with poor management, You get a good manager every now and then. You have a fast turn around time for Managers/ Pharmacists.  What is wrong with that picture?!"
good,Decent easy job just not good pay they pay the people that's there forever lower than the new hires that have no clue on running anything. Other than the pay it's a good job to have
good,My overall exprience with this company is not the best. They allow the upper management to say whatever they want to there employees. They also make you feel like you are always doing something wrong. The only time the store manager wants to take the time to talk to you is when you did something wrong not the fact when you did something right. It's now the point that I have been working in a hostile working environment. So I need a change!
good,"I feel like more and more, big companies are treating pharmacists as licenses. Pharmacies I was at were probably some of the busier in the company, but I feel like they should be giving more help to these pharmacies."
good,Work place is nice.Could be stress full at times.There's always work.You can learn different tasks.Sometimes management ok.The hardest part is to keep your percentage up
good,cvs was way to busy at some hours and tech wouldn't have time to eat. interactions with customers could be a good or bad part of the day depending on who you were dealing with
good,"The store is a great place to work,the other asst.manager and I work very well together to make customers happy."
good,"room to grow if you can work with in very strict payroll guidelines and find a way to suceed. Easy to get onboarded, very hard to run a  successful store. 12 week training program is not good."
good,Overall CVS Health is a good place to work. I have grown tremendouly in my role and have come onboard to make some needed and welcomed changes. There is an opportunity for improvement when it comes to prioritization and balance of colleage and employee satisfaction vs. outdated SOPs.
good,This is a very stressful job but only if you don't know what you are doing . After learning every work station the jobs becomes really relaxed. this is also the lowest paid pharmacy .
good,"The hours are flexible depending on the location. Opportunity to work at various locations and switch up responsibilities (Cashier, stock room, etc.) If you stay long term, you can advance to a head cashier or management position. "
good,"This company is a good company to work for. Its been a great run for me, but managment needs some work. Overall good place to work for. HR department rocks!"
good,The hours were long sometimes working 15. The work was easy but difficult because ppl did not want to help so teamwork was non existent. The pay raises were minimal.
good,Good job with a big work load and a low pay. Ive worked at CVS for a year now and have had an above average time there. If the pay wasnt so low i would not leave
good,"CVS Pharmacy technicians do not nearly get the credit that they deserve working in a retail and health environment. Sometimes requiring employees to work 12 hour shifts but usually only getting one lunch break. This used to be okay until they no longer allowed food in the pharmacy. "
good,"After 12 years with the company, I only make $4/hr more than when I started. Average annual raise of 2% which adds up to a few cents per year. Definitely do not feel appreciated"
good,Good company to work for just need to focus more on work life balance for employees. I love the flexibility with WFH. Good stable company to work for in spite of no work life balance.
good,"The store I was a pharmacist in had a good pharmacy team so all in all the experience wasn't too bad. Every year the demands were greater with fewer resources to accomplish the said demands."
good,"Having worked in multiple positions for CVS Health, I can definitively say that if you are on the bottom of the totem pole you're probably going to hate your job.  The higher you climb in the company, the better it gets.  Working at the local store is the absolute worst- goals and expectations are set exceptionally high and you're going to be worked like a dog for little pay and no benefits.  Once you get into corporate-land, you get benefits (health care, paid vacation time, and  usually a set schedule).  Unless you really get high up into the corporate infrastructure, you're going to be at the mercy of the ""powers that be"" and the fact that they do not have a fair understanding of the positions that they manage.  If you can get over having no control and no input on some critical policies and procedures, then you'll probably love your co-workers and the generally enjoyable environment."
good,"The management sucked at my particular location, I enjoyed what I did before we got new management. The company its self is decent to work for, just be careful of the management you work for, some are god awful."
good,"I would come in everyday at work, and just start on my assignment. I wish i had a better sense of purpose being there. Management and some of the employees were hard to deal with at ties."
good,This was a fast-paced work environment; there was always much work to do.  This work was production/customer service based.  Collating large amounts of data was my chief responsibility here.
good,"enjoyed working at CVS. The manager was very nice, made working a stressful job enjoyable. I left because the salary does not match the work done. Long hours with minimum pay"
good,Good company but have to be a good fit for the business unit you are working for.  Certain positions are paid very well.  Health benefits are not great but CVS contributes to HSA.
good,The job was OK overall I didn't really to much care for the pay and no growth the job was flexible I was off every Sunday and I worked a set schedule every week
good,"undergo intensive training from the start"
good,"-Leadership is out of touch with Lower grade staff. "
good,"The company is making it harder for us to accommodate the customers during checkout. There are a lot of new restrictions, which cannot be overridden by anyone, including management."
good,"This was my first real job as a pharmacy tech, I learned so much about what it takes to be a technician. I worked near north western so we were always busy which teaches you how to work under pressure."
good,When I first started with this company the job was great.  However the changes in payroll the company has implemented has made the job impossible to complete on a daily basis and has driven employee morale to a all time low.
good,"Not a horrible job but not the greatest either. They could definitely improve on how they treat their employees. Over worked and under paid, for sure! Their company polices are a lot of the problem. The management was expected to do so much in so little time by the corporate office that they were sometimes, understandably hard to work for."
good,"Insurance has high deductible before copay on sick visits. Management does not care about you driving on ice and doesn't give raises easily when promoted. They require you to do so much that patients don't actually what you to do while also filling prescriptions. There isn't enough time for it all. Cvs is crazy. But a jobs a job and if you need it then go for it, its not a bad job really."
good,Its a job. The PIC manager there is so not fair. I'm treated like she doesn't even want me there. I barely get hours and I am a full time employee. Eventually I will lose my benefits at this rate.
good,They trained me to get my Pharmacy Tech license that was the best part of being there. On the job training. The days were very busy. The hardest part of the job was the cranky customers.
good,Very corporate. Long hours and little flexibility. Overall it seems to be a reactionary company. I commuted 2 hours daily and wasn't ever offered a different store.
good,"A typical day at work included calling insurance companies, pharmacies, patients and doctors offices to help get drug approved for patient to start or continue therapy. I did not like upper management or human resources they did not understand our job and were not helpful. There was very poor training and oversight. People that should be promoted were not and people that didn't deserve to get promoted did. Overall it was good experience."
good,"good hours, good pay, vacation time. long hours, sometimes weekends, set schedule. full time and part time. must meet a rate every week, bad work and life balance."
good,"The PIC was a transfer, and had not been trained correctly to manage senior technicians, creating a hostile work environment. My yearly review was never completed, even after three weeks of being available, and all raises were denied"
good,"I liked working there, i learned a lot working it thought me to me more productive, respectful, and patient. Most enjoyable thing about working there was the relationship you build with each customer"
good,CVS is a good company to work for overall. The work is fairly easy. The only complaint I have is there is lack of communication. There were many times where we were not made aware of changes within our department.
good,"Working at CVS Pharmacy / Health taught me how to work with many different types of personality.  Working in customer service helped me humble myself, which was very beneficial in working with the public. I also learned how a big business runs in order to be successful."
good,"Daily interaction with many customers. Worked with some great pharmacists and staff. Pharmacists were very knowledgeable and easy to work with, always willing to teach the technicians."
good,Good jobs helps with experience also great coaching always payed time off this jobs is a great opportunity  also with working in the medical field it gives you great experience
good,Good job. They do not care about your personal life though. Great discount and somewhat manageable schedule. Management is good with the supervisors. Hardest part is always having to be on the register.
good,CVS is a typical corporation where the upper management's main priority is clearly to make money above all else. They pay outside contractors to create scoring systems for nearly everything involved in the workflow at the store level and then criticize employees based on these numbers as if it is a reliable system (even though it has been proven to be very flawed and not an accurate representation of what is really happening in the store). Upper management is out of touch with what is happening on the store level in general.
good,"...because you're going to have to carry the team a fair amount of the time. "
good,"A typical day at work is multitasking under pressure. I learned my native language which is spanish while engaging with customers everyday. I learned a lot about inventory, filling prescriptions, and alleviating health insurance company discrepancies. Immediate management in my home store are very caring and thoughtful, but also abide by the rules. District management are very strict to meet their standards and goals that is expected from the front end of the store, as well as pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is knowing that pharmacies sometimes will have to go by a budget, which requires hours to get cut. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting through the day being a problem solver and customers who have been helped go home happy and on a path to a better health when they get their medication."
good,There are a lot of things to learn working in the pharmacy. If you are willing to put in the work and take the state certification exam it will definitely be worth it. As you can demand more pay or seek employment else where for more pay.
good,"very typical pharmacy technician job where you fill and decipher, deal with customers, multi-task, handle multipule cases for prior authorizations. I was a floating technician so i different work experiences everyday with different people."
good,"A typical day at work usually involves my beginning the day with clocking in. I then start my usual work routine of completing the morning duties of checking temperatures and entering in due prescription, also by calling hospitals and patients to follow up on medications and etc. throughout the day I fill scripts, help out customers and answer phone calls. we also do a number of things including filling documents in regards to state and federal laws. this being some of the days to day duties."
good,It gets your foot in the door for a great job opportunities but would like it if cvs would focus around your talents you have and take it into consideration.
good,"Assisted Pharmacist with filling medications  and communicating with medical offices. Maintained patient medication profiles daily for accuracy. Interacted with clients daily, helping them with their purchases and returns"
good,"Nothing particular to note. It's customer service and as such you'll run into people who will test your patience. The pay is minimum wage, about what you'd expect. The managers (and the store I worked at went through many of them) never seemed to care, thus making everything more painful than it really needed to be. The best thing about this place is the flexibility in your schedule. Typically the shift manager was pretty lax and more than willing to work with you to make sure you have important dates off."
good,The majority of my day is working out of a queue.  My team reviews potential member issues and tries to figure out if this is a set up issue or if this is just a input error.  My job entails a lot of research and problem solving.  I also work on new business for the company.  This part of my job entails client facing and populating documentation.  I also have to review the ask of the new business and make sure that our system can support the intended set up.
good,"The schedule varies each week. There is no set schedule each week. It is a fast-paced work environment and there is a lot of customer interaction. When training, it seems like there is a lot to learn, however, the pharmacists will work with you to ensure that you are properly trained before letting you do something you're not comfortable with. If you are looking to work part time, you will be over worked and under paid. The full time employees are the main priority here so they get to pick and choose their schedule and you will have to be able to work around it. The managers are very nice and you will quickly form a love/hate friendship with the pharmacists as well as your coworkers. The hardest part of the job is training. It is very difficult to try to learn everything because the company is constantly changing and expanding. However, it can be rewarding if you enjoy forming relationships with patients."
good,"They don't give enough hours to the stores, which then cuts how many techs can work at one time. If there were more tech hours then the job would not be nearly as stressful. I don't think techs get paid enough for all the stuff we have to go through by the end of our shift. Management is ok."
good,"CVS was a good company to work for, but I was paid very little, not given enough work hours, and didn't have the best managers. A typical day consisted of filling prescriptions, cashiering, answering the phone, and helping customers."
good,"I work part-time nights. Jan 2017 there are only 2 techs allowed to work at night and it puts a lot of pressure on us because we need someone to take drop off, do pick ups, and take care of drive thru and handle production. We basically have to wear skates but I love helping people with their medication therapy."
good,"A typical day is spent producing new prescriptions, call MD offices for insurance prior authorizations, verifications of prescriptions.  I have gained retail customer service.  Co-workers ranged from educated experienced technicians, to brand new trainees.  Constant rotation of staff.  Under staffed, lack of hours."
good,Good people to with in shipping will cross train if willing to safety is a big problem there long hours during holidays beg to get 40 hours during summer
good,No one has a clear answer for some issues but  a lot of experiences gained from that job. it is for a short term jobs. Benefits are limited. Supervisors are friendly but not experienced
good,Not enough training received for the job your expected to do. Lots of overtime is required. I was hired part time (24 hrs a week) but only worked that schedule for one month.
good,"The work environment was unfortunate. The coworkers made it a toxic environment, there was no means of advancing in the career, work was hectic. The transfer over from Target to CVS was messy. The trainers were mediocre."
good,"A typical day at this job, is a busy day. You will have the opportunity fill prescription, do inventory, insurance claims, retail sales and so much more. The management team is okay; the co-workers are okay as well. The hardest part of the job I believe would be filing the insurance claims.The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing the smile on a customers face when they are satisfied."
good,"Nice place to work; good management and coworkers. Not much room for advancement. The work can be tedious, however, one can work very independently, if that is something you're looking for."
good,A great place to increase your skills and prepare you for further self advancement. Customer service is a vital part of this job.
good,"I'm happy to say that I'm part of a great team with a great manager. We all truly do our best to help and support each other, something you don't find every day in corporate America"
good,The management at my particular store was not that great. They had employees come and go often and could never keep a stable set of staff members. The company itself was not so bad.
good,"Solid starter job, not a career. The pay is not competitive but they'll start you out in the industry and teach you what to do for better paying jobs in the future."
good,the typical workday was very stressful. the outcome of your day was always dependent on the experience of your co-workers and the amount of help hours that ytou had for the day. Management was not caring at all and only cared about the numbers. The most enjoyable part of the job was caring for the customers.
good,I have worked in the pharmacy for CVS/Pharmacy for years and I enjoy my coworkers but corporate treats us like we are all prisoners or thieves.
good,"I wouldn't recommend as a career job, but it's a cool place to get through school. Co workers are ok, impersonal. You don't make life time friends here. Pay is minimum wage."
good,flexible work schedule. Low pay rate. very busy work environment with a diverse staff and customers.no room for advancement.
good,"CVS over all is good company. I, myself did not like the department that I worked for and the rude customers that I had to deal with. Co-workers were great, supervisor's were awesome."
good,co workers were great just not trained in an efficient amount of time.  I am already licensed and certified to be a cashier all day was not ok wish I had better training in a better amount of time
good,Happy to have had an opportunity to work there and help others. It is what I like to do. Environment was settle quiet but everyone working hard.
good,"Hours are less, the environment is not always positive, the managers are biased at times, and this is not a good job. It is definitely just a part time job that is how it should be"
good,Good benefits for hard work. Management is not fully involved in day to day operations and doesn't fight for the little guy. Big business doesn't care about the work as long as its done.
good,Get to work days & nights but hours get cut & never enough help.  The pay is not that good.  Always busy . Not all employees were helpful
good,"working in a cvs pharmacy can be very informative ,fast passed ,a lot of work , with room to grow, great management "
good,"CVS is a great starting place.  It's a fast-paced, great start to my Pharmacy Career.  My day begins at 11am.  I will go in and start by ringing out sales and assisting the Pharmacist with bagging prescriptions.  Every hour we will rotate to another station.  12 noon I'm at the Drop-off location, where I will input customer's prescriptions and type from the Triage, handle billing, doctor calls, and any other issues that will arise.  At 1pm, I will move to the Drive-thru where I will retrieve prescriptions to ring out for customers.  Also, I will assist the Drop-off, where I will pre-enter prescriptions and help type in coming orders.  2pm is my turn at Production.  Here, I will print orders, pull medications, count, label, and send them down to the Pharmacist.  I will go to lunch at 3pm, and return at 4.  The rotation will then start over.  In my downtime, I will restock vials, bottles, printer labels and paper, take out the trash, clean, or whatever else is needed to wrap up the day.  My shift will end at 8pm."
good,They lack in people development. They want the culture retail dreams of but only the field team gets to have this. Tight payroll no training but expected to know it all.
good,"its ok to work for, but working in aetna you cant really move around for advancement. you can move from ccr1 to ccr 2 in 6 months"
good,"The typical day for me at CVS consists of a lot of cleaning, talking and smiling. I learned that pursuing an education and working is super challenging. The management at CVS is better than most places i have been, but still have room to improve communication wise. All my co-workers are hard working and dedicated. I love working with them. The hardest part of my job was being on my feet the whole shift especially when I have school on the same day. The most enjoyable part is  making the customers smile."
good,"Typical day involved not enough people at work"
good,"I deal with patients every day. On an average from 10-20 patients have meds that are refilled and I have to make sure that the meds are on time, are agreeing with them and they have all the supplies needed to be infused. I enter the meds, and the pharmacist checks them to make sure its correct. I talk to patients by phone and pull all charts and then file them when I'm done. My work day starts at 9 and goes till 530."
good,I have made alot of strides in the company. Literally started from the bottom and moved my way to the top. Learned everything i know about management from this growing company. Company keeps you busy and keeps your day full. Definitely does not have many fun days that make you forget to enjoy what you do. The most enjoying part is definitely the pay and seeing others grow in the company and move up. However I am open to learn a new business if the opportunity is right.
good,"I worked hard, and was overlooked by someone I had to clean up messes after. I worked well with the pharmacists, but management wanted me to do more for less money, which isn't fair."
good,Was not treated as equal. Some co-workers are helpful but some are not very nice. My pharmacy manager refused to teach me more skills.
good,"because of payroll cuts every year the managers now work shifts by themselves at the same time trying to stock, ring up customers, and merchandise."
good,wouldn't recommend a job with this company. expect too much for your daily routine. came home daily in bad mood and didn't look forward to going to work.
good,"It is a retail environment however management as in district pharmacy managers expect too much and I don't even think they even know how much pharmacy technicians make. The pay is not worth the stress they put you under in keeping scores. However it is a good company to work for aside from the overall unpleasantries that come with a retail environment and the strict pressure to ""maintain good scores"". It all really depends on your pharmacy manager which varies from store to store. Some do not care about their people at all. Some I don't even know how they got promoted to being a boss. There are good managers but it all varies from store to store and it can make or break a pharmacy."
good,"Unfortunately, I would have to say that; working for CVS pharmacy. Was not quit a great experience. Many of the technicians were always in competition with one another, only interested in power and control and protecting their turf, deliberately avoids eye contact when speaking to one another, steals credit for work done by others, kisses those up the ladder and attack those below, cuts a person out of the communication loop, ignores individuals or gives a person the “silent treatment, intimidates through gestures, purposefully interrupts a person during meetings and conversations with patients, discounts/denies a person’s thoughts or suggestion, and also "
good,not unusual to work 13 hour days always short on employees in every department. work is extremely physically demanding with very little time at home
good,"very stressful work environment, hardest part of the job is having the right team to work with. there was no breaks for pharmacist due to the fact that each store needs to meet specific numbers to be a successful store."
good,"My days usually consist of running around doing pointless busy work and making sure other staff get their pointless busy work done."
good,"I picked orders to be shipped to CVS stores. I learned to be accurate. Mostly women on the picking line, I had no problem but some ladies could not deal with the different personalities and little groups were formed like high school. An experienced manager would of solved s lot of problems. Most of the managers had very little people skills and were not very professional."
good,"The interviewing and hiring process was horrible from day one. The hiring process took three months and I interviewed with, no joke, Five Different People. They couldn't, or were unwilling to match the pay I asked for, basing the figure off of my qualifications and years of experience. Pay is substandard at best if you know your worth."
good,"In my time at Omnicare, I sat threw 3 reductions in force, finally being affected when the company was sold to CVS.  I grew as a professional in my time there, but the environment could have been better.  Moral on my floor was very low and there was little done to try to improve morale.  Upper management cared only about the bottom line and not about the individual employee."
good,It was the good people that made the place fun and productive. Management needs to work on their communications and to promote from within the company.
good,The sales floor is staffed by just two people the majority of the time. The standards are set very high based on the number of payroll hours available. I was hired to be trained as a supervisor. I completed all of my portion of my training. After completing my supervisor training I was asked to train as a Pharmacy Technician. I am currently waiting to take my state certification test which I have to pay for.
good,fun work place with too much to do though less pay. the benefits are also poor compare to what others offer and salary is determine by store managers for most of the workers.
good,"Good co-workers to work with.  There was a lot of variety in what I did each day."
good,"Managment need to be more supportive of their staff and their staffs needs, this normally goes un-noticed and has caused a turn over of staff to be relativley high these last few years"
good,"Senior leaders excessively rely on consultants and unfortunately, very little on their own employees. Company should value their own talent by listening more to them. Employees will be more motivated if that happen."
good,not that great. customers are okluiqshdlihdljhsfljahsdfliuahslfuihaslfhlasjhfluihfliuqhefuhelufhlsdhuflaygdfluahdflhdaslfvgsdluvgflsdufvlsdgflhsdgflu
good,"Great benefits. The company as a whole is very organized but management is horrible. They are not considerate of those who are college students and trying to work. The manager gets to work his/her 45 hours a week usually Mon.-Thurs while everyone else works every weekend and get a off day when the manager feels like it. Employees quit very regularly at this job. Even if you want to work one or two days the manager does not work with that. They only care about the ""business "" needs. So you have to work what they tell you. The schedule is made two weeks in advance so which is not beneficial for anyone because anything can happen. If you don't want to make your own schedule working at CVS is ideal but if you want a flexible job don't choose CVS."
good,"Changes abound with little or no security for those that do a good job.  Operationally, things remain the same, however overall environment appears to be tentative."
good,"I typically am a front end cashier. When there is down time, I stock shelves, ""front"" shelves, enter damages into the system. On closing shifts, I ""front"" the products, collect all the trash, vacuum and help lock up."
good,Not much to say. Its a job that do not value their employees. Always finding something wrong in what you do but never acknowledge the good.
good,i enjoy my job but i need something better! ive been here since 2014 and ive learned a lot of important things with the commercial and government claims.
good,A typical day at work was not typical. You never knew what to expect from your patients and you never really knew if it was going to be a good or bad day. Overall it was a great educational opportunity for me. I took advantage of every chance to learn something new.
good,"I have worked at CVS for 10 years and throughout the years, it has become very challenging to work for the company. Instead of the main focus being on customer and how we value them the concentration is strictly on numbers, numbers, numbers, with customer being the least of worries. Also, the work that you put forth rather you have plenty experience or not, you never get recognized and the pay should be better for the field of work it is."
good,"Omnicare is very corporate,"
good,"Very Supportive Management .  High demand to Customer Service.  Company requires each employee to reach goals on a weekly and monthly basis.  Pay and benefits are not desirable.  Schedule is made weekly and hours vary.  "
good,Some of the employees are decent to be around. But management does not crack down the ones who are not working to full potential. There is alot of favoritism in this workplace. My job was not hard. The people and the ridiculous rules made the job stressful.
good,"Co-workers are friendly, the most enjoyable part of the job is truck day, the hardest part of the job is not being able to recycle, I've learned how to communicate effectively with my co-workers as well as the customers. A typical day at work involves helping the customer, restocking shelves, heavy lifting and constantly moving around."
good,"Excellent benefits and retirement packages. High workload demand as a manager with a lot of unpaid ""extra"" hours to meet goals and attend meetings.  No staff budget making quality support staff difficult at best."
good,"Out of 4 weeks of training time, our computers were down 2 1/2 weeks or more. You have to ""bid"" on schedules to see what you end up working."
good,I rather not say how I feel. Everyone's experience is different and with any job it whats you make of it. Everyone will not have the same views as i do.
good,Typical day involved stocking shelves and running registers. Constant price changes kept us busy. Clientele were great. When there was more than two associates working the day went by smoothly.
good,"Always busy and working"
good,It's all about providing great customer service to the customers and focus on detailed and understanding of the customer needs
good,"moving up is not possible, no benefits to part time associates and hours being cut doesn't make it easy to provide the service we want to give"
good,"cvs is a ok company to work for."
good,Don't apply for this place if you have other options. Management always trying to convince you things will get better. In reality management needs to changes in order for things to get better.
good,"was an ok job, the hours where very uncertain. one week 10 hours, the next 40 hours. never once had a weekend off the entire time i worked there."
good,"a lot of pressure to get everything done .Always cutting hours .staff help excellent but could only do so much, no breaks or very hard to do"
good,"Management was not around much for help."
good,"I love to learn new things on a daily basis. I learned so much and added new skills frequently. A typical day at work i would come in, check emails and reports, print any needed recalls or price changes. I would give daily tasks for the team such as cashiers. I would work in pharmacy as needed. Throughout the day i will have tons of customer calls and problems i would fix. I had to check in vendors, and work merchandise to the sales floor. I unloaded the truck. I was the go to person when anyone, customer or employee needed something. prepared and deposited deposits daily."
good,CVS is a very progressive pharmacy that constantly changes to best keep up with the ever-changing health care system. It is a very stressful job as most other retai pharmacy jobs. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the demands of the customers and company while being given limited hours to schedule technicians to help with the workload. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and job security. This job has taught me how to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles by sharpening my problem solving skills and leadership characteristics.
good,"Helping customers get the medication they needed.I learned that some people are greatful for your help and alot of the elderly don't have anyone to help them. "
good,"Working for longs, I have learned and experienced a lot and gained lots of respect and friendship. I liked working the overnights because you really don't have to deal with all the craziness that happens during the day. Although, the hardest part about this job, was the fact you lack lots of sleep and the ""many"" duties that was required of you and the overnights. Most of the time, they give you MORE than you can handle, NOT knowing that most of the jobs that we do is very time consuming. It was hard, because CVS is always short of workers (overnight clerks especially), so with short staff, comes with MORE jobs for us overnights to do because the clerks during the day can't finish their jobs because they get called on register a lot. And not all the time, overnights is full staffed either, sometimes their will be 2 of us and during our ""busiest"" week, the most workers we have during the night is maybe 4 if we are lucky. "
good,"Very big on customer service and privacy information."
good,"It's a study job, but you offend feel abuse or misuse.  I have work for CVS for quite a long time.  I had my ups and downs with this company.  You never know what to except when you go in to work. I been trying to get out, to save my insanity."
good,"A typical day was unit dosing orders, shipping and mailing them. Also we did monthly nursing home consultations and recommendations. It was a small committed team."
good,"A typical day at work would include tending to each customers needs and delivering fabulous customer service. At CVS Heatlh you must always be on 'A- Game"", as it is a place where it asks a lot of each employee. At certain stores management can play a large part in whether you have a fun or miserable time at work. The hardest part of the job is that it asks you to do things outside of the workplace, like online questionnaires and assessments about various things in the workplace which can become very time consuming (no one wants to spend a lot of time working outside of the workplace)."
good,Being a customer service/sales rep is pretty simple job that requires patience and good people skills. However I would definitely recommend this as a first job.
good,"underpaid over worked employees. I have seen A LOT of drama. I'm sure most work environments have them. Under staffed, so really stressful."
good,It is a easy job to learn work skills just needs some improvements and organization. Loved my co-workers. The hardest part is some of the supervisors. You have some nice ones though. Not a bad company just needs improvements.
good,Running a 40 million operation on 215 labor hours a week.  Very challenging to run a store and you are the only resource to work the extra hours because i am the only salary manager.
good,CVS Health is great with not showing any racism towards anyone. They hire throughout every culture. My only downfall is the pay rate for doing so much. We don't get recognized the way we should. The management does nothing when you have a problem with another employee. CVS Health is great for a starter job if you are in need of money but its nothing to make a career out of.
good,"I loved my co-workers.  Management was based on who knew who and who liked who.  There was good flexability in schedule.  Way too much ""mingling"" between female staff and male management."
good,"Helping customers by filling their prescriptions. Learned how to maintain inventory. Very high paced atmosphere. Had to input the nightly order to keep stock adequate. Management was helpful and attentive. Hardest part of the job was pleasing the minority customers who were difficult to satisfy. Best part of the job, conversing with my co workers and most of my customers. I also loved it when my instincts were right."
good,"Answering incoming calls from customers. I learned about a lot of different medications their classes and also their use. Management with Caremark was terrible, they tend to not care about the employees."
good,Always working 12+ hours even when they tell you the day they hire you that you'll be working mostly 8's sometimes 12's or 10's. No its not true. you'll always be working 12's everyday. i did for 3 months straight and i have 2 kids barley got to see them.
good,"A typical day at work involves multitasking, highly stressful job situations, there is no time to really help patients clinical wise. Be on your toes all day long and alert. The best part of my job is when I have the time to help a customer that really needs my clinical knowledge that will eventually help them and lead a better quality of life."
good,"CVS has a great team of individuals working together.  Management within the pharmacy could be better.  Pay is horrible.  "
good,Overall fun collegues to work with and strong team work. I've learned to work at a faster pace and multitasking to achieve set goals.
good,Come in collect all damages from the departments. hardest part is when you had to damage out products that had no box or damaged just a bit.
good,"This job is absolutely grueling. The expectations are unrealistic with the number of hours you are given. The compensation is decent for someone without a college degree, but you will do more than your fair share of work. If you train and work with knowledgeable people, you can be successful, but the training for managers is inconsistent at best. The compensation provided for anyone less than an assistant manager is unfair in this marketplace, and it is difficult to align and engage a team when you cannot compensate them properly for the high expectations they are held to. The best part about this job is the variety of things you will do and learn."
good,"I wasnt able to contiune on with Connecxtions, due to  the work schedule they proved me with it was a conflict for me. Once I got the hang of it, I enjoyed working at a Call Center."
good,"If you enjoy good benefits, steady work, OK pay and don't mind favoritism, back stabbing, being singled out and treated as if you matter as much as bucket of dirt, help yourself and apply... I sincerely hope you get a decent manager who doesn't have a nasty ego... and my pay was only as high as it was because i transferred from the east coast to the mid west."
good,You do a lot of work for minimal pay. Raises are hardly given unless they really need you. too much work and stress for the pay.
good,"It was a great place to start in the Medical billing field.  I learned a lot in billing and had great success there, the workers were very friendly and helpful."
good,"With my time at cvs,they wanted the customers treated very highly. The management just wasn't able to satisfy the employees enough to keep good help. I have consistanly watched people walk in and out of the workplace and  management just didn't care.The co-workers who did stay were pretty awesome."
good,"Not a terrible place to work for technicians, after 2 years your expected to take a certification exam for NO extra pay after this exam. Seems like a promising place to work but even my Pharmacists tell me to move on to another job"
good,"I earned customers names and what they like and dont like. "
good,"Supervised employees, handled cash, opened and closed store, inventory maintenance, handled all customer relations issues (accidents) in accordance with company policy and promote a positive shopping experience for all CVS customers"
good,It is an okay place to work to get an idea of how a pharmacy works.
good,It's like you typical retail job and management was decent.  Some rules aren't always clear but overall it isn't a bad establishment to be a part of.
good,"During my shift, I am required to get all of the tasks that my manager assigns me done. However, besides those tasks I also have to tend to the customers needs, such as walking them to an item they are looking for or cashing them out when they are done shopping."
good,CVS is far more concerned with not offending people than they are with stopping theft. The upper management lets their greed get in the way of doing an effective job. On an individual level though the Agents are an effective force.
good,I just started at this company a couple months ago and we recently found out that this location will be closing at the end of February. From the little experience I had here I am happy with it. They are a nation wide company so they offer lots of advancement and relocation opportunities.
good,"It's an okay place to work. I do not enjoy pharmacy, so I would rather work somewhere else."
good,Great work to keep you busy but not enough hours. Great people to work with. a typical day opening up store or closing store making sure customers find what they need stocking shelves inventory
good,New Management hires contractors for almost $5 more per hour than FTE.  The Director is a close friend of the CIO and has no IT experience.  Listened to the Senior Manager ask one employee why his wife was incapable of taking a cab home after being released from surgery.
good,"I did it all, stock, cashier, unload truck, greet customers. I loved my job until it got unorganized and become unprofessional how they started handling things. Overall I loved my co-workers we were one big family there all helped each other."
good,It's a joke that pretty much anyone can make more then you if you work here. Funny to think you're dealing with peoples lives...
good,"Long hours during holiday season."
good,"CVS is a good place to start for employment as a new pharmacist.  Get your feet wet at managing the high paced, stressful world of pharmacy.  You can practice and refine  your skills with counseling patients and reviewing therapies for patients who want your help."
good,"Working for CVS helped me expand my knowledge of medications and helped me see things in a different perspective between the customer and myself. My co-workers were amazing, providing help and helping me with every question I had. The hardest part of my job would be customers with lots of complaints and they have nothing to do with the pharmacy and they made everything up, for example providing bad customer service, when they are the ones that are not maintaining a calm demeanor during a situation. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers and giving them the most enjoyable and devoted time I can possibly can to them and to help them leave the store with a smile on their faces. I motivate myself everyday working as a Pharmacy Technician because not only I can change a persons day from bad to good, but I can also make a difference every day."
good,Working there I met some nice people. The hardest part of the job was fitting all my duties into the day. I really enjoyed working by myself.
good,"overall good place to work, demanding but lots of OT pay. 6 months out of the year working OT, bad thing is that they dont have lap tops for us to work at home."
good,"Omnicare has a good job culture, but poor leadership and poor management."
good,"I hated this job! The company believes that you can make 95% rate weekly when the job is so difficult. Many of the employees ""cheat"" on their rate."
good,Great work environment but don't expect great raises.  If you have no experience then you will be started just above min wage.  Raises are once ANNUALLY and full-time hours are hoard to come by.  Training is a joke and the only way you learn the job is by doing it.  Customers can be VERY rude when it comes to meds and insurance so expect to be treated badly from time to time.  They are trying to figure ways to track each employees work and grade you on may factors but if you get slammed your scores will go out the window.  The PIC (pharmacy-manager at store level) won't bust your butt to bad as long as you try but if your slow don't expect to get good hours or good shifts.  The only reason I've stayed as long as I have is that my boss and store managers are amazing and hav worked with me during some difficult times.
good,"Typical day was fast pace & at times challenging, but was also my favorite part of the job. Job security was good but the advancement was difficult to get. Co-workers were great. Management was not that involved."
good,"very busy environment that i enjoy doing"
good,"Typical day at work is filling prescriptions, answering phone calls, calling insurance and doctors offices. Maintaining work flow, customer service, keeping inventory levels correct."
good,"This store is the busiest store I have ever seen. "
good,Not that good in managing their employees. Management don't care about whats happening around the  workplace they often sits in their office. Co workers doesn't care about the customer. in three years i'm I'm working in this place i have a lot of customer keep coming back to me and asking for my help and no one else coz they feel comfortable asking me than other workers. that's the only thing I enjoy in this job helping people as long as i can and give them the customer service they never had before.
good,"The days are so different combines with happiness sadness and sometimes stressful but you learn to cope with all aspects of what the day brings. Management do try hard but does lack organisation. We have some fantastic workers but like most places a few that let the company down.The hardest part of the job is when you just don't have much time at a clients home and you know they need you , maybe just for a chat or a problem they would like to share with you, but worst of all when they have had a fall and hurt themselves just that little extra time would be wonderful just to be there for them.the best part of the job is when you know you give your 110% to every client and they so much appreciate it. Just to see them smile is all it takes to have a good day ."
good,"The job was okay, very confusing when just getting on board...hours very messy and not steady, constant moving around the department."
good,No good management skills did not allow for a successful working environment.
good,"As a publicly traded company, CVS Caremark focuses on the bottom line and everything else - its core values, compliance, work/life balance, and what is best for the members it serves comes secondary."
good,"There was always something that needed to be addressed, researched or resolved. The more I accomplished the more management wanted me  to accomplish.Job satisfaction was knowing my staff and co-workers trusted my ability and knowledge. Days off were based on the workflow calendar and over time was expected,"
good,"customer service was held to a high standard, Co-workers were friendly and got along very well. Truck days were celebrated with lunches"
good,I love being a pharmacy technician but CVS is a terrible company to work for. I have been there for 2 years and still haven't gotten a raise or offered a full-time position. very irritating.
good,"- sometimes have to stand and work for 14 hours straight"
good,"during my workday, I would typically drive 250-300 miles running service calls. covering all of South Texas. the hardest part of the job was that I could never stay caught up, and management was always demanding more than I could give. My customers were great, I had been taking care of their stores for the past 14 years, so they were more than customers, more like an extended family. My co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I went on an emergency call for a critical system outage and the customer immediately knew everything was going to be alright! If it weren't for the hostile environment that my management created, I would never have left."
good,not worth my time.Bad Management.Overnight crew is expected to do everything.when their's only 2 employees an that's including the supervisor. regulations require at least 3 employees on schedule. not safe. pay rate is not worth it.
good,excellent on the job training. Upper management is very helpful with concerns and needs of staff
good,I love the people that I work with but the advancement opportunities are really bad. The pay is miserably low
good,"Had a good time working there.  My first line sup was very nice, and the team leads were always willing to help when needed.  I was cross trained in many different area's with in a few weeks of being there."
good,There was always lots of work to be done and you gain gain lots of knowledge on state Medicaid programs. The only thing is ther's not much room for growth if you'd like to become management becasue the job is so small.
good,"I have worked in CVS pharmacies in North Carolina and Georgia, in my experience the higher the volume of prescriptions a pharmacy does on average the better it is staffed, and therefor is less stressful and more enjoyable place to work."
good,"A typical day at Omnicare is very fast paced and still a successful day, but co-workers do not take responsibility for their actions. I've learned how importance our job position reflected the importance of the company. I learned how to process and verify medication thoroughly, to achieve a better success rate for the company. My co-workers were the best team members that I've ever worked with, they helped me gain knowledge and work out errors to perfect my work experience. The hardest part of the job I've experienced was my first few weeks of training, learning how automation was very important and works for the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the criticism at the end of the week or in meetings, because we as a team found professional growth in learning from our errors."
good,Its a good place to start off working.  I do not have anything else to say.
good,"My role is extremely repetitive, and after quickly mastering the functions I perform, there was limited room for growth. Management positions are available only to extremely experienced individuals."
good,Typing and filling of prescriptions. I learned many drugs by name and how to read sig code and type all incoming prescriptions. Working with my team was enjoyable knowing that we all put in an effort to help not only us but the patients we receive.
good,For a college graduate looking to expand within the medial field this is a great position to begin your career.
good,"Usually a day at work is fairly busy. Between phones ringing and people dropping off prescriptions, we're never without work. I learned how to handle difficult people in a courteous fashion. I learned to multitask and work at a fast pace. Management was probably the best experience in the pharmacy. The head pharmacist is very good to work with, and cares about his techs. My co-workers were great to work with. We all got along and teamwork is definitely abundant. The hardest part of the job is the fast paced lifestyle of the pharmacy. It's very easy to get swamped in a work environment like that, but that also includes the most enjoyable aspect. When we get busy like that, my co-workers are a huge help. We are synchronized and use teamwork to its full potential."
good,Pharmacy is always a mess when I come in at 8pm.  Pharmacy manager is good in terms of business numbers but horrible with managing people.  Hardest thing is getting yelled at by your pharmacy manager that a minute task isn't done when you were busting your butt all night to clean up her mess.  Hardest part of the job is the long shifts.  Most enjoyable is counseling patients
good,"while the opportunities for advancement aren't there, it is a great place to begin your career"
good,"My co-workers were very helpful. "
good,"Management here is totally underrated. They don't pay their employees at a salary that is competitive to the going rate and, outside the immediate supervisor, they do not care about any employee's concerns. Management as a whole does not grant an employee's wishes to move into other areas, thus provide no room for advancement, when in the initial interview they said there will be. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Working with client to help provide Med D coverage to mbr"
good,"Long hours , nice co-workers able to learn a lot about medical"
good,"Fast paced and worked well with pharmacy team. "
good,"I enjoy the research and attention to detail digging down into the customer requests or complaints to resolve the issues"
good,I love my co-workers. But I have been trying to transfer stores for over a year and management has been extremely unhelpful.
good,I will be finishing my Associates Degree this winter and need to find full-time work with opportunities to advance.
good,"A typical day would be filling over prescriptions with very little technician help. I have to answer the phone which constantly rings and give a lot of over the counter advice. Overall, its not a bad company to work for but is full of a lot of stress."
good,"I'm an external employee who doesn't work in the office much.  When I do, it seems as though the culture is ok."
good,"working for cvs for fun and hectic. it was hard dealing with the customers because of the location but overall, great experience for me."
good,I work a 10 hour night shift. The only thing that I like are my coworkers. We all try to make an unnecessarily serious and stressful workplace more manageable. Management doesn't communicate with each other or us regarding major decisions. I appreciate having a fixed schedule and overtime opportunities both mandatory and voluntary.
good,"Its Was a learning experience, management was not to well organized but it was a great experience."
good,There was never a typical day at work when I was employed at CVS Pharmacy. Everyday I went in there was something different so I never knew what I would have to face. I learned a lot while employed at CVS Pharmacy. I learned how to follow the planogram system while setting a brand new store. The management was great. The co-workers were great and very fun to work with. The hardest part of my job was not knowing my schedule and if I would have to work or not. That begun to be a little frustrating. The most enjoyable part was working shoulder to shoulder with new faces. People I did not know and some I got to know very well. I assisted in closing down one store and opening another. What a challenge.
good,"data entry"
good,"Busy, fast pace"
good,"Our day begins with making sure that we are ready for any calls from our patients and our nursing facilities. Follow up on any previous days work, such as re-billing third party insurance and also re-billing Medicaid under specific time to ensure proper reimbursement."
good,"CVS pharmacy is a great place to work as a pharmacy technician if you are looking for job security. Generally once hired you can maintain a similar schedule and hours so long as there is enough help in on your team. Easy to take days off if needed for other work and generally flexible with school schedules."
good,"The best part of the job was definitely the people I worked with. The company seemed to be more of a business than a provider of healthcare, but they were trying to include more clinical training of technicians and interns when I was there. The hardest part of the job was the long, busy hours. They were very flexible with my schedule while I was in school."
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers with questions and helping them while locating merchandise, and proceeding with an efficient rapid chekout experience. Data entry, research, labeling medications, assisting pharmacist with translations, pick up procedues, refil requests, and maintaining organised clean and  professional atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work wouod be to complete the drivers payroll, make sure that all paperwork was filked out for the drivers loads and all evelopes and reports were ready for the drivers."
good,"Loss Prevention for about 4 CVS stores. Apprehend potential thieves as well as watch for internal theft. Write incident reports, and attend court dates for internal and external cases."
good,"When I got to work I would store belongings in locker and go to cash register to clock in. I had a 7 digit number and a 4 digit password. Once clocked on I would help ring out any customers in line waiting to buy product. I always greeted with a big smile and asked how they were doing and if they needed help finding anything else. If the manager wanted me to do something else such as out dates, stock, dust, help customers on the floor, well I started a new project. A lot of the time my manager was in a bed mood so didn't get the best respect but I accepted it and did my job. At closing time, I'd make announcements on how long the customer has till close. Most of my time was customer service."
good,Nothing special here. A typical Rite Aid-ish run-of-the-mill retail pharmacy.
good,"Working Overnight was interesting. The hardest part of my job was, that I dealt with customer who would steal and be intoxicated. I would always greet the customer so they knew i saw them and was less likely to steal. On truck day i would, unload truck and work it onto the floor. When i worked day shift i would help the customers find what they needed and face the floor."
good,Overall Omnicare is a pretty good company to work for although the chance of advancement is very slim. My biggest fear with Omnicare is job security. Loved all my co-workers GREAT people work there.
good,"many problems with this job, low pay, horrible management paychecks were always wrong"
good,"The people you work with day to day make for a rewarding job environment.  It's also great working with patients and making a difference in their lives.  Management, however, does not tend to put the same effort into developing and valuing people within the corporation."
good,"filled prescriptions, customer service, dealt with patients"
good, Filling prescriptions and helping customers with minor medical advice dominates the majority of the work day. Taking phone calls and restocking store inventory is also part of the job. Making deliveries may also be asked to do. 
good,too small of a staff so you will be doing everything. between to worker
good,CVS Caremark is a good company to work for but be prepared to work long hours and only expect a good wage for new hires.  
good,The work environment is awesome do mainly to the co-workers I worked with. They were very helpful and are great people to work along side. Supervisors seem that they are new to the position.
good,at cvs i had to clean and cashier. days were great and so were my co workers
good,"A typical day included stocking the cleanroom, following proper aseptic technique in compounding of drugs, labeling and bagging of drug, and cleaning and sanitation of cleanroom. I learned computer systems such as as400 and simplify. My co-workers were one of the best parts of the job. The hardest part of the job was not having the ability to advance. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that what I was doing was actually making a difference in peoples lives."
good,As district pharmacist worked in every type of pharmacy imaginable.  
good,A typical day at work is challenging and requires a lot of teamwork. I have learned that when times get hard to express your feelings to the appropriate party. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you will have a job the next day even if you are doing your very best. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co workers and customers on how to improve day to day customer service.
good,"Like that it always kepted you busy, learned that there are very many sick people with little or no insurance provided"
good,My co-workers were great. Customers were great. When there happy your happy. The hardest part of the job was not being able to fill the perscribtion promptly. The enjoyable part about my job was the customers. I love meeting new people. To hear them come in and you know them by name was wonderful.
good,"Get to work at 11pm read note's from the left from my from store manger and list of thing that need to be done for the day."
good,Everything is never black and white. Too many managers everyone is always confused.
good,Company was founded and is managed by pharmacists and clinicians.  This group has not had the incentive to keep up with changes in management philosophies.  Many cultural perceptions and practices are archaic and outdated.  This company will be challenged to modernize its thinking in the coming years.  How they respond to this challenge will determine the course of their survival.  Current executive leadership needs to be revamped. 
good,What I enjoyed most about working at CVS is the customers. I love to work with the public.
good,It used to be great environment for work . But being so stressful lately for no reason specially if we considered to be no.1 on sales . But we been asked to come to work in our days off with no payment for meetings and that for several hours .
good,I enjoy the customer interaction the most with my job. I have really developed great relationships with a lot of the customer. a typical work day for me and very busy and full of things to do. I don't think my Job is hard at all.
good,Great to get your feet wet in the retail industry but no room for growth at the store level. Numbers based company meaning they will cut hours and expect same production.
good,Didn't get much hours would cover 9 hrs per week. Management shows favoritism not a place I wanted to be. Quit after 3 months
good,Hard work and multi-tasking skills are needed for this job. I have gained a great deal of knowledge after working for this company.
good,it was a good place to work and i learned about medicare. the staff was good to be around. the hardest part of the job is when the systems did not work. the co workers.
good,Being the largest Pharmacy Chain in the US. They don't often appreciate the employees for all that they do.
good,I was with the company for 13 years and went through three acquisitions. The last merger from Caremark to CVS Caremark was the most challenging. Everything changed and work life balance suffered. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with colleagues and clients. Hardest part was providing feedback to leadership. Leadership listened but was the action was not there.
good,"what a typical day was like working in a call-center environment, was logging into the phone system on time and ready to take inbound calls for the day. What I've learned most about the jobs I listed on my resume is that to always treat others the way you want to be treated. What if you were the person on the other end? And as far as management goes I really don't get into politics. I do the best I can when asked to complete a task. Which leads into co-workers there great and all, but I'm being paid to do a job. I don't really think to much about co-workers. The hardest thing about the job is getting up in the mornings. And the most enjoyable part of the jobs I've worked is the festivities. From bbq, pot lucks, and pic-nic's made it really fun and relaxing."
good,I worked part time here. I started out in the front cashier and then moved to the pharmacy. I really enjoyed the pharmacy part.
good,"BAU Retail & Pharmaceutical Operations. Responsible for Execution, Sales and Service, employee supervision of 23, Merchandising/ Presentation, Scheduling, Front Store Initiatives/ Inventory Control, Cash Control and Administration."
good,"I like the job, however I do not like not knowing when my work day will end. Rules and regulationd change from day to day. This is a very physical job. I like that but, you have to be fast paced. My most enjoyable part was meeting and working with some amazing coworkers."
good,Potentially Great place if the management took care of their pharmacist. High turnover rate.
good,typical work day busy
good,"They're great if you're looking for a good temp job. I was only there for a contract, but it was decent pay!"
good,"Taking a referral for Home IV infusion therapy, verify benefits through internet or phone calls to many insurance company government and comerical. Getting auths and collecting copayments from patients over the phone. Management was not stable, kind of a manage yourself position."
good,"I usually ran the register in the front of the store. After a few years, I ran the Cosmetics which I enjoyed the most. I had a few different managers. for the most they were fine. But the last one is little tough on her employees. I enjoyed meeting all the new employees though the years. One is now a very good friend of mine. I believe the hardest part, was in Pharmacy. I could not pick-up how to do things."
good,"CVS is a good place to work if you are a student. There are flexible hours to work around classes. If you are looking for a career, this is not the place, there is little to no job advancement. If you are a people person and love helping people get what they need in a timely manner, this is the job for you, however, you must be prepared for delays, computer system shut downs, and angry people."
good,Good place to work considering the compensation provided.
good,"CVS pharmacy employees work very hard during every shift, however, the outcome is very rewarding; patients who trust CVS, doctors who work amiably with CVS employees, and insurance companies who are certain claims will be adjudicated with accuracy. The CVS employees get along as a family and make scarifies for one another. The management team (varying between store) can be strong and reliable."
good,Saw a comment complaining that she's worked for cvs for 18 months and has only gotten a 22 cent raise and works 35-40 hours a week and is in ga. Girl I understand but I'm in sc I've been with cvs 3 years still making the same pay since the day I started. Since I started I have gotten nationally certified and state just waiting on that state in the mail so hopefully I can get a raise. I also am still part time been trying to get full time for 3 yrs. We have so much stress here we say when they hire people for cvs they should go ahead and give you a Rx for xanax to go with the welcome packet.
good,"If the pharmaceutical industry is some place that you are interested in, CVS is a good place to start out."
good,Worked there for almost six years they need to change some things in the company then it would be a great place to work for
good,"I don't work past 7pm Mon-Fri. I normally work 1 weekend out of the month.My co-workers & I get along great. we are a great team, working together."
good,Very challenging and not a lot of room for error. You are micro managed and management seemed to bend rules for some employees and not others. Lot of negativity amoungst the employees and disrespectful behavior and talk.
good,"With a recent change in upper management, this company has taken a different direction. It is now all about profit for corporate shareholders. The new unofficial company motto is ""more with less"". You are expected to make more profit with less resources. Expect to do the work of 3 employees."
good,Integration efforts skew worklife balance is the most difficult part of job; Past 9 months heavily weighted with integration and re-host efforts; daily production support efforts provide right mix of challenge and stability to daily operations. Awesome set of team members.
good,"Very busy, a lot to do every day. Management is really shotty, and the pay is way under what the workers deserve."
good,"My hours at work are 8:30a-5:30p, which I like. My boss is a wonderful woman and if it hadn't been for her these 7 years, I would never have stayed at Omnicare. She runs our department so smoothly and organized. There are 7 people in my department and I get along with all of them. My boss trained all of us very well and in turn, some of us have trained some of the new people who came into the department after us. I think that the Medical Records department is the best run department in the whole building. However, there is no advancement at Omnicare, and the raises are 10-30 cents a year, if that. For example, I started out at $10/hr and in 7 years I now only make $12.15. So it took me this long to make a tiny increase in salary."
good,"nice people, they need more workers, but don;t want to pay for more"
good,"worked for longs that is now CVS/caremark and was pushed out to make room for new employees and CVS not longer has that neighbor hood feel, but rather a big money making store."
good,no full time available. great co workers. tough schedules.
good,"well rounded place to work, good for meeting new people, opportunity for growth"
good,• Consistently providing individualized therapeutic based care for patients under the direction of a registered pharmacist.
good,A typical day at work is dealing with daily operations to run the business successfully. Attending to customers to ensure satisfaction.i love the feel a close knit family between employees and regular customers.
good,"Working with the patients was the best part of my day at CVS pharmacy although my co-workers and superiors all had a superiority complex it was bearable. The way that my co-workers treated the patients was a little extreme, even when they were right. Overall I think this company, or at least my store, lost sight of the goal to serve our customers with a neighborly attitude."
good,"I do overnight, so it can be very tiring working from night to early morning."
good,Favortism was shown greatly in my department and I found it very upsetting. Evidently time on the job didn't mean anything to them then. I won't go into detail.
good,"Very fast paced work place, good breaks, free snacks, and very professional environment."
good,"Low pay, lack of management accountability, lack of communication, and bullying tactics from corporate management are serious issues that plague this large chain pharmacy."
good,you are just busy with client services and doctor calls all day.
good,I took incomming calls and gave customers info about thier benefits.
good,"Loved working here. The worst part however, somedays you work 13 even 14 hours at a time with no break. If you didn't smoke you couldn't go to break. The management was outstanding although they do occassionally wrongfully accuse people, because of hear say."
good,"Gave assistance to store personell on how to repair registers, frontstore systems and pharmacy systems."
good,"Depending on the store, the typical day tends to be extremly busy without enough hours to handle the amount of work that needs to be done. Hours are cut during the busiest time of the year. The computer system is the least advanced of the major pharmacies-it runs slow and crashes often. Management varies in stores and districts, but usually does there best to appease there under payed workers if money is not involved. The best part of the job is flexible scheduling."
good,Work day was exhausting. 10 hours a day at a computer screen with limited mobility was the hardest part.
good,ok place to work...over focused on numbers rather than customers.
good,Ok company keeps you busy and never stop co worker are ok very physical job
good,"I love working here, in every company there are things in which do not always make us happy but my overall experience is interesting, informative, and educational."
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a great stepping stone for something better. They fully train you and give you many opportunities that you have to take advantage of. I worked in the pharmacy and I was able to become state certified in only 3 months of employment. They don't have great pay, and they will overwork you (12 hour shifts). Management is constantly changing."
good,Overall Omnicare was a great company to work with. It was unfortunate our department was laid off.
good,It can be a very stressful and demanding job that requires a lot of work that isn't worth the pay.
good,"I worked at a few different CVS stores located around me, I even transfered stores. They are nice to you until you are officially working at their store and then they dont treat you as nice anymore. There is alot of drama!!"
good,"Nothing else positive to say.  I wish this review did not have a 150 character minimum because I really don't have anything else positive to say, so I'd rather not say anything at all."
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are lucky enough to have the right district leaders. Unfortunately, moving up in the company is hindered by poor management."
good,"My experience at CVS Health:  I am an older worker, 58 years old with 36 years of experience; I felt out of step-like a dinosaur.  The job itself, inbound customer care calls was pretty typical of a call center experience."
good,"Not bad for what you get paid. Lots of annoying training to keep up with, and lots of upset coupon goers. If you can deal with that it’s not bad at all."
good,"The typical work day consisted of stocking shelves in every aisle, cleaning and dusting off every aisle, taking care of the customers needs while working on the aisle, replacing product tags in the aisle than needed it, and cleaning the entire store. I usually worked an 8 hour shift with a 30 min break throughout the day."
good,I was treated well by my managers. I was often left to my own devices in the front of the store and was expected to use my time responsible. Do the tasks assigned to you and keep your workspace clean and you too can have a good experience.
good,Managed many stores and there's never enough hours/employees to complete the work unless the manager puts in extra unpaid time or it just doesn't get done at all. Best part of the day is going home.
good,"The managers are always negative. CVS tries to come across as a caring company, but is all about the almighty dollar and no consideration for there employees."
good,Their main focus is on their  metrics and not the quality or outcome of your calls. Raises are performance based making it near impossible to advance.
good,I’ve been at cvs for a little over a year and there are pros and cons. Pros is it’s flexible to your schedule if you go to school. Cons is the neighborhood I work in is a bad neighborhood so I’m dealing with the community there which can be difficult.
good,"I love my job, but there is a lot of favoritism that goes on here. I honestly feel that if things were fair across the board this would be my forever place."
good,"At my location, every day is different. Some are slow, some are really business. Being a retail environment, with the added pharmacy factor, it could get very stressful. Management, stereotypically, would consistently push for better metrics, but offer little help, guidance or solution to achieve it. I grew fairly used to it, though the yearly ""merit"" raises still do not feel like enough for the tasks we do, and the customers we would handle."
good,Decent job. Mostly no room for advancement. Very goal oriented. Mostly focused on keeping up with production. Unable to bring in any cell phones or other tech.
good,"The work expectations are unrealistic with the amount of help you are allowed to use. It is a high pace, stressful environment. Even with talented co-workers the job seems overwhelming and can cause great anxiety."
good,"Used to be a good company with reasonable metrics to meet. Now the expectations are ridiculous, technician hours are being cut leaving pharmacists with almost no help."
good,"Not bad, could be more focused on employee advancement and training. Customer surveys seem to be the benchmark for everything even thought one can't  predict the mood of the customer at the time of service."
good,Cvs Caremark was a very fast pace workplace. I do not feel CVS Caremark pays there employees what they deserve. Within the five years of working there I did learn a lot. I also met a lot of great people.
good,"Great company and mission overall with wonderful pay, but abusive execs (female execs in particular) seem to be rewarded time and time again after we get sued or people leave because of them. No exaggeration. I think we all know companies do this but it is extreme on the Carrmark PBM side. Less so on retail."
good,Had pretty good pay and I got lucky with a great store manager though upper management was disorganized and came up with unrealistic expectations. Didn't see that many opportunities for advancement other than store manager or the pharmacy so I quit.
good,"I enjoyed my customers and my team however you do not get training hours and are expected to train people for free. Managers are based on 45 hours but since you are salary then you work 60-70 plus hours to keep up with the workload. Benefits were reasonable as far as copay's but I felt we paid a lot out of pocket for insurance. Upper management changed a lot and each manager was different. The work culture was great they felt like family but I never got to see my real family. The hardest part of the job was balancing home and work life. Too many tasks and not enough time to get it all done. I learned how to manage people, problem-solve, communicate, how to treat others and not treat others."
good,"CVS evolves each and every year. They have come away from keeping their employees happy to, its all about the customer. While admirable, their employees suffer with a heavy workload, high expectations, and minimal hours.  Over the years they have replaced enjoyment with stress.  And now they are slowly replacing people with self checkouts."
good,"High manager & employee turn over. Hard for advancement. New management changes constantly. Lots of overtime. Revolving door. A circle that continues like a non stop farris wheel. Great stepping stone for another future somewhere else. Biweekly pay with benfits, 1hr lunch, sometimes provided, as an incentive or thank you instead of pay incentives."
good,Their HR interview process is a joke. Nepotism runs rampant. People stand around talking all day and don't do their job. Managers protect their friends from corrective action.
good,I learned a lot about the Pharmaceutical world and how different types of pharmaceuticals effect what is ailing a person. Very intuitive and fun to learn.
good,Management was terrible. Store manager was hardly at and unfair to employees. If it didn’t benefit her she did not care about others or their situation.
good,The day to day operations change about every 24 hours.  Information is not always relayed to the employees in a timely fashion. Most days are filled with some form of challenges in which the employees are forced to overcome.
good,"When I started my career at CVS, it was an exciting, rewarding career.  The company has changed their leadership philosophy in the last several years and lost their focus on the colleague."
good,"We have very high turnover in the department due to the lack of work - life balance.  I have worked an average 60 hour work week for most of the years I have worked at CVS Health and felt there is an insurmountable amount of work to still be completed.  I have enjoyed the challenge of the position, but the expectations in an ever changing environment are typically unattainable to many on our team which contributes to the high turnover.  I consider myself to be extremely successful, however, others on the team have not been and it has added more to my workload."
good,"Cashiers are expected to also stock, take passport photos, put merchandise back on shelves,  get photo orders and straighten shelves all while helping customers."
good,"Poor management, lack of ability of manager. Unable to establish boundaries with certain individuals. Was disrespected by employees. Store was disorganized and dirty."
good,"I worked at CVS for four years and was only treated like a human being under a single store manager who was actually good at what he did. Every other store manager I worked under had been promoted to their level of incompetence and struggled to see employees as anything other than warm bodies to occupy labor hours. Corporate routinely sided with angry and misguided customers, punishing employees for following arbitrary and poorly-written guidelines set by the company themselves. I was a happier person after I quit."
good,"Upper management is hard to deal with and expect too much for the hours they allow for labor.  Job itself is fun and rewarding when left alone.  Customers, for the most part, are a large part of the greatness."
good,I learned a lot of good customer service skills dealing with patients and insurance companies. I enjoyed helping the customers. We were often very busy and that helps to make the days go faster
good,If you are a single person with no kids just maybe you can tolerate not having a life outside of CVS. This company consumes entirely to much time and you aren't given enough payroll to complete all the task that are given with ridiculous due dates. You are micro managed a lot and if something isn't completed you are expected to work extra to get it done.
good,"The pharmacy is always fast paced. Also, you must be able to multi-task. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is keeping a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part is the return customers. They make the job worth doing. However, the pay does not reflect your years of experience or hard work."
good,"Easy to do job. The most stressful part is managers and customers, mostly customers. The customer is always right so managers will usually honor whatever a customer says in order to make a sale (You will become numb if you don't have the right type of managers to back you up). Some days there was nothing to do but stand and wait for customers. CVS is not the place for people who go by the book because corporate will force you to please customers  every need."
good,"Working in the front store of a CVS is not the best job but it is flexible with a school schedule which was what I was after, it is a typical retail environment."
good,"CVS was fast-paced, understaffed, and poorly managed. No room for advancement, low wages for the fields it employed. Work/life balance was okay, but hours were never guaranteed."
good,"The staff are fantastic and most customers are reasonable. Corporate will cut your hours at the most inconvenient time, making you rushed during flu season, before a holiday, etc."
good,My time at CVS Health as an intern was slow paced and relaxed but I still learned so much that goes into running a store such as a CVS. The pre-existing employees there made sure I felt comfortable and knew that that I could complete my assigned tasks.
good,"Typical day is 10-11 hours, 5 days a week, maybe 6 if there's a call-out and you're a union store. Working with one other person most times. "
good,I could not take an offer due to the store manager would not approve my transfer then said I'll start training you but that has yet to be seen. Certain policies have yet to be followed.
good,"Work in the pharmacy. Cut, cut, cut our hours. Top level management expects miracles with hardly any hours. Love our customers. Had some great managers, had some horrible ones."
good,"The interview process was pretty easy and quick at the time,but now it is a much longer process.  You will have to wait for the drug and background check to come back after you have been selected."
good,Some departments are better than others. Most supervisors are kind and nice. Some management is not as personable as they should be. Overall good company to work for.
good,"It could be better at my store. I love the people, but they’re way too laid back. Lazy, apathetic even. They’re nice people, but sometimes I’ll be scheduled with 4 or 5 of my male coworkers. There are sometimes 3 or more managers working with me. There isn’t a lot of company policy that is put into place, or followed through with. It’s kind of annoying, and recently I’ve only been getting 4-5 hours a week):"
good,A very good company to work for and you really can advance if you can get on full-time. The hours are never the same it varies from very low to low . Don't give enough hours to survive off. But overall a good company to work for.
good,have to decide if you want to make it a career or not because it is a thankless job the customers are right 90 percent of the time but the job is not difficult the people that work there make it hard
good,Before all CVS Pharmacies in Mobile cut the hours drastically this was a great place to work. The team was great and I looked forward to go to work. But after they cut hours it was no longer a fun place to work. They made it where the only people working were the managers and supervisors. They laid off many people (not me but just saying). They then expected management to still do everything else AND stay up front to welcome and ring up customers.
good,The work is okay management needs work so do the people you work with all they do is talk behind everyones back it isnt really a healthy but its good.
good,"Relaxed environment to work and interact with different people, from employees to customers. The work can be a little challenging and tedious, but that should be expected at nearly any job/career!"
good,"Layoffs like any big group, benefits have gone steadily down hill over the years and are increasingly expensive. Once you're in you have a better chance of getting something higher up or more interesting by transferring internally, which is also how you help make up your salary with current new hires with low yearly raises. Management depends on teams and pay can vary wildly between departments as well even in the same job grades."
good,"It was a high volume pharmacy. Duties are filling the prescriptions, counseling patients, recommending OTC medications, typing new prescriptions, inventory management."
good,"They say they are family friendly ,they are not if you work as a temp.Temp gets harder points if your out one day it's double points.Not at all fare for temps."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in and managing the register. Also, I had to do whatever else the mangers needed me to do. This included stocking shelves, looking for outdates, putting out sales signs, and general cleaning. For a first job, it wasn't horrible pay, when I first go there I got 9/hr and then later the bumped up the starting pay to 11/hr company-wide.  Overall it was pretty boring and most days I would have almost nothing to do but for a first job it wasn't horrible"
good,"Call center, people are nice, but the work and guidelines to follow are pretty rough.  If you like helping people, you'll be fine, if underpaid a bit."
good,"If you want to build a strong character. Build many social relationships, learning how to handle difficult situations that occur, and many more. I became more confident as a person. The customers are all different cultures. Coworkers were understanding. Flexible hours. They offer fulltime-partime. They offer the pharmacy technician license."
good,"I have worked for this company for 2 years now and recently they took away bonuses and also I did not receive a raise since the previous year, they have good benefits but they need to do more to show they actually care about their employees."
good,"warehouse work, store not busy enough for cashier. Main source of income is liquor sales.. Store needs repair. Enjoyed the customers going to the pharmacy"
good,"-  picking and packing orders for different cvs retail stores"
good,"Over worked and underpaid, no growth, company demands a lot and you feel stuck, like you cant get out. There aren't any good incentives to keep you motivated."
good,"Due to the constant testing, I did learn a lot while I was employed at CVS. I also learned that large, chain pharmacies are all about maximum profit so you will be understaffed and overworked basically all the time and you will never be ""full-time"", so you will never get benefits. Also, due to the ""large, chain"" environment, you will likely end up working to cover for absent or late employees rather often."
good,"cvs really cuts store help. as a manager, you spend alot to time on the cash register. you can be left on the front end for hours even when you have been assign to set a plan o gram or another function of which you will be held accountable for.  you get no help or support even when the manager has promised that the front end is covered.  it is hard to plan your day to get things done."
good,The profession of pharmacy has changed a lot in 10 years. We do more and more with less help. The job has gotten very stressful. I really am concerned for the future of pharmacy.
good,"The only negatives about this company are that the technology is old and the available hours do not allow for enough people to be scheduled at once. It is difficult to keep the lines down in a rush because of this."
good,corporate does not take the time to even research what is going on in the stores even on a quarterly basis ...........................................
good,I left cvs due to fellow workers and the commute. I was working at a store almost an hour away from my home. If the work environment would have been more friendly and less tense it could have been better but overall it wasn't a terrible experience.
good,"Management and clerks work together to help customers find products that they need or items meet their needs."
good,"Typical day is managing pharmacy operations, providing excellent costumer service, deescalating situations that arise. Management is present and monthly expectations must be met. Expectations are extremely high and your stress levels will rise. Workplace culture can be enjoyable but is stressful."
good,CVS has a lower pay scale than other employers.  The company does not expend a great deal of resources on retaining quality employees.  They do offer time off and discounts.
good,If you’re only looking to work a few days a week then cvs is the place. The job itself is pretty easy. They aren’t very flexible with hours and most employees aren’t happy with their schedules but it seems they try to accommodate everyone.
good,Management sucks as far as store managers Not good i feel the company is racist towards African Americans.............................................
good,"Everything as cvs is great and easy, I have no issues with the fact that I was able to place in the pharmacy program fairly quickly. But soon it became a hassle to get hours or finish online modules. Managment was hostile and uncomfortable."
good,"Its not a bad job, just the workers tend to make it feel like we are in high school with poses. feels like a hierarchy work place. Customers are the sweetest"
good,"Easy job that only requires basic customer service skills. The pay is very low, however, from what I've heard there's definitely worse jobs out there."
good,Challenging work place but all work experience is rewarding. Standing on one's feet is takes a toll physically; large flow of customers in and out of the pharmacy.
good,Very busy and can be very stressful..You work really hard and get no credit from management for all you do..they have you on a mixed up scedule..your whole life is nothing but CVS
good,"Expected to run the entire store alone. Very busy. If you're looking for a job where you won't have downtime, this is the one. The manager is present (in their office) usually. The entire time I worked here, I was alone in the store for the majority of the time. Kept me busy."
good,"daily routines include stocking, facing the store, counting down, making deposits, and assisting customers to find items they're looking for and suggesting other items they may need."
good,"Good coworkers, nice customers. Very physical job. Busy, fast paced. Management exspectations are unrealistic. Work is piled on while having to do regular operations at the same time with no help."
good,"Job had its ups and downs but our motto was teamwork. The manager was good at getting his colleagues ready for the next step. Honestly, our store was challenging."
good,"The minimum requirements for this role, are high school degree / GED and be of age, with some experience. "
good,It has become almost impossible to even have time to eat lunch or use the restroom! They are continually decreasing the tech hours even if you are doing 600+ Rx a day.
good,CVS focused so much on numbers and achieving a certain level that it became less enjoyable to come to work. The company's management in lower levels tried very hard to be empathetic but were being held to certain standards in made it hard for them to be humane.
good,Company needs to invest more hours into its stores both in the front store and the pharmacy. Even though hours have been cut consistently they expect store performance not to be effected.
good,Good to have experience. Then go to other place to grow and expand your knowledge. Job is stressful especially dealing with rude customers. No Growth.
good,"It was manageable. Personally couldn't deal with the management but others might be able to.Overall it was a good job. It had its good days and bad, some more than others."
good,a typical day is at register also doing money orders and Money Gram you also have to help with the photo gallery. we stocked the inventory and went through inventory date checks we faced all products up and down the aisles and vacuumed anddusted the store.
good,When I first started working there I was promised a lot of things. I haven’t gotten any of the things I was promised even when I had asked about them.
good,Drivethru and phones are infuriating. The workload is too heavy most days. Very few customers are nice and appreciate your work. Opioid patients are usually the worst.
good,"Can be a great place to work. However there is a clear diconnection between corporate and store fronts; lack of hours, support, etc. I gained a lot of experience working here to take elsewhere."
good,I started at CVS as a cashier worked my way to photo lab then got promoted to shift supervisor then took position as a pharmacy tech but pay wasn't that great so went elsewhere
good,CVS Health has a fantastic learning environment to keep each individual on their toes and full of information to learn each and every day. Everybody's opinion on CVS is their own for their own reasons.
good,It's a very male frat boy company. Don't expect too much if you're a woman except significantly lower pay than your male counterparts with equal or lesser experience.
good,"In the beginning and even now I enjoy working for CVS. The only downside are the hours. I could go from working 40 hours one week to 20 the next, and yes my manager is very well aware that I need as many hours as I can get. However, corporate keeps cutting hours more and more every week. So I wouldn’t expect consistent hours, even if you’re hired in as full time."
good,CVS will end up with no technicians soon i think .. they keep on cutting the tech hours even at the stores that are super busy .. i think the pharmacists will end up working alone without technicians soon!! i dont know how those people think
good,"You will get what you feel is a great chance to grow but little do you know it is a way to get free work. They will not pay you for being upskilled, the over all pay is not good at all. The vacation is the only thing that is really good. They have the most backwards rules every for a call center. I haven't been there 6m and I make MORE than someone who has been there 3+yrs. Who by the way has been upskilled 3 times now. It is crazy."
good,Although I am well compensated. I am not supported by management with my concerns about my work location and the volumes of prescriptions exceed those that can pro mote patient safety . More concerned about volume of prescriptions filled than employees needs.
good,"CVS is strictly focused on making the company more money. While they do have the best interest of the customer in mind, they have no regard for their employees. They are constantly cutting hours to save money, creating the most stressful environment for the people on the job. They expect the minimum number of people working, while managing to hit all their expected numbers. They have inflexible hours and never provide any type of bonuses except for holiday pay."
good,"Getting worse by the year!!  They keep cutting payroll but expect more, and more, and more....it's getting impossible, and I run one of the highest volume stores in the chain!!"
good,"CVS offers a lot of thorough training. Stress depends on coworkers and store volume. I worked at a high volume 24 hour store. However, we were sufficiently staffed for the most part and we had a great Supervising Pharmacist. "
good,"Overall CVS is a good place to grow and develop as a pharmacist. The biggest challenge is that a lot of the time workflow is such that a lot falls on the pharmacist on duty (verification, filling,consultations, pick up, prescriber calls, etc). So unless you have a really good lead tech (which most store do not have) or able to delegate work, most of the time the pressure falls on the pharmacist."
good,"Provide care and service to patients"
good,"Typical day is High paced volume, pick order via system driven guidelines. Full-time fulfillment trainer in place. Management is fully engaged with team."
good,my work day would start as logging in my computer and phone on time check my emails to get my schedule and patient name information to be prepared to call physician offices to provide refill requests on the behalf of patients. what i have learned were different terms and how to place calls through to the pharmacist to make changes on dosage and instructions that needed approval. the most challenging was trying to meet by calls per hour and time management while being on a call
good,"CVS Health was a good company to work for, however it was a very constant call center environment and was difficult to reach your supervisor or other teammates for questions.  The training was 5 weeks, however it taught you the basics and then when transitioning to the ""floor"", that's where you learn the most."
good,If you choose to work for them just be aware of how they treat employees and chat with people in the store you are to work at first. Employees are more then happy to give you insight if you ask.
good,"I loved the people that I worked with. They payed well, and it was fun. They just did not offer enough hours, there was no way I could pay my bills on 18 hours a week."
good,This job is all phone calling and data entry.  No patient contact in person.  Not a lot of autonomy or input appreciated.  Not a lot of direction or guidance from the start with workflows.
good,"Preform normal duties of technician, very well staffed, HR is very good at handling situations, security is okay. Pay is decent and you can expect a yearly pay increase"
good,"I worked with an amazing team. The environment was very hectic and there was never enough staff working to handle to workload. Often times, the pharmacy would be so busy that I would find myself skipping my breaks so that I could leave on time (or as close to on time as possible). The pay is not worth the stress."
good,"a typical day at work was stressful, very tight space for medications and every hour you were made to rotate locations. I learned to always stay ahead of daily tasks like stocking medications from returns and shipments. the workplace overall was very busy."
good,Working for CVS was a challenge after working for Target for almost 15 years. The focus was more on volume than service. I didn't feel like a part in the team.  Tow the line or get out.
good,"Being an operations manager is pretty easy if you have previous retail experience and great training opportunity if you don't. Its great if you want to start a career in management. You may have long hours and not the days you want off, but thats retail."
good,A typical day in CVS is very fast paced and busy 95% of the time. Customers will get rude with you and you have to try your best to help them. It is a great opportunity in learning medications and building customer service skills. It is always so busy you can not even take your 15min break.
good,"CVS is now focused on it's mission and instead forces workers to in essence sell products to customers. They will fill without permission, hound patients to pick up, and force the flu shot on customers. It is a tough work environment but paid well."
good,Not a bad place to work but you have to work on weekends to make up for any holidays you may have off. Supervisors are not consistent or fair with their supervision styles. Too much favoritism.
good,"I learned a lot over the years and was able to advance in my career at CVS. However, over the last few years I relocated to the DC metro area to help with a overall goal of improving the area and this is where a lot of negatives were exposed to me in the company."
good,Not enough time in the day for my workload. Work long hours as salaried all year round. The workload is not balanced among team players. Have add opportunities for advancement if I want a lateral move.
good,Cvs is ok to work at as long as you dont mind people talking behind your back and as long as you are there to do the job and go home dont expect to make many friends
good,"My workdays were very fast-paced. I appreciate this company giving me a chance because I was fresh out of Pharmacy Technician school when I began working there. I learned how to to cycle count in the pharmacy, I learned how to process the orders when the medication deliveries were made and I learned how to operate a cash register. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help the patients."
good,"I didn't feel like I could grow in my job here, it was very set in stone. The management was okay, the coworkers were okay, but I didn't feel very appreciated when I worked there."
good,"Working at CVS wasn't so bad , the manager was just all over the place didn't half way know what was going on half the time and was always off but didn't make sure the shift was covered for that day , it just was the worst experience . I couldn't wait to find me another job so I could get away from that unprofessional place."
good,"Everyone is replaceable in this company. You can give 110% and it's still not enough. Their mission sounds good but they don't practice what they preach. They say they promote a healthy work- life balance, but if you're not staying late or volunteering to work outside of businesses hours/on holidays, you're viewed as not being committed. The stress I felt while working for this company definitely did not ""help me on my path to better health."
good,Enough work to continue to keep you busy for the day but your workflow and output is dependent on having enough competent staff members.Decent benefits with 401 k and small stock
good,If you enjoy helping people and learning new skills this is the place for you. Teamwork is important and the ability to be flexible. Compassion and an eagerness to learn are key.
good,"It seems that once a lot of coworkers get comfortable within the workplace task completion seems to decrease. Although someone who has been there for years has a very lazy work ethic, management at best would speak with the person but take no action in order to change that kind of work ethic."
good,Had a culture that did not conform to company mandates. Didn't know if that was just the new millennial workplace that had past me buy or I was just out of touch. There were a lot of great people that I will miss.
good,"CVS was a part time job, that I was able to attend while going to high school. I would stock shelves and ring customers up. The work wasn't exciting, but it being one of my first job opportunities it did teach me a lot."
good,"There were no set rules and regulations on how to become a full-time employee. We were initially told, 90 days and we would be able to receive benefits and once we met that, we were told we have to work 13 months full time and then wait 90 days for the benefits."
good,"Working for CVS for over 6 years was a blast. "
good,I enjoyed working at CVS Health Great TEAM AND TEAMWORK!  my manager was great very accommodating. although it was a great place to work. it is a very cutthroat  environment and often wonder was my job secure
good,"When the workplace is properly staffed then it tends to be a good day. If we are understaffed, things can get very stressful and customers get irritated."
good,"It was a great pace to work, I just never got the hours I wanted too, and the management was poor. There was a lot of outside drama that was not needed in the workplace."
good,CVS was a good place to work for but the benefits and pay was not fair in my opinion otherwise it was a great place to work and would recommend this job to anyone.
good,CVS Pharmacy is about improving their metrics but not about improving their work environment. Pharmacists are burdened with many tasks and not enough technician or intern help to deal with it. Technician hours are arbitrarily changed weekly with no explanation as to why and no way to appeal for more hours. The entire pharmacy staff is burdened with increased job demands and not enough help to deal with those demands.
good,"The company was good to work for until ""metrics"" became the dominate driving force for everything. Hours were cut and new programs consistently added. Thus work conditions deteriorated to unsafe demands and expectations."
good,Fast past and very employee oriented. Management  listen to employees opinions and changes are made where it is profitable to the company. Love working for the company.
good,"The job is nice, but there is some poor management depending on the team and department. I am on the Novologix team and it can be overwhelming as we deal with a lot of health plans."
good,The job is touch as a pharmacy technician. Overall it is a good job with lots of room for advancement. The compensation is not high enough for what technicians do but what job is?
good,"the time that I worked for cvs I found that it was an easy going job, customer service is one of the most if not the most important thing about the job"
good,"Although received reams of paper of SOPs, the important information needed for daily operations were not fully expressed. Too many assumptions made by peers."
good,"It depends on your district, but in mine it was hard to get a raise. I worked there over three years and took on three different types of extra responsibilities including inventory management and training new hires and barely saw a raise. I also got all stars when I was reviewed every time and apparently that never happens."
good,"Worked part time while attending college. The job tends to be simple. Enjoyment of the job is highly dependent on who your co-workers, manager, and customers are. Pay was slightly above minimum wage. Solid job, I recommend for younger people looking for part time work"
good,"Management plays favorites. Great co-workers. The workload was stressful, especially during the fourth quarter. Work from home was offered, which was nice."
good,"No real bells or whistles about working at a CVS Pharmacy.  The experience is only as good as the Pharmacist manager and the script count of the store you work in.  If you are fortunate to have strong coworkers and good pharmacists they can be a fun place to work, but CVS has never been very competitive when paying pharmacy technicians.  They will continue to lose the best technicians to hospital pharmacies or independents/grocery stores where you can feel less overworked and more appreciated."
good,"overworked, too many management changes but having he ability to work remotely has made it bearable.  Have to fight to be promoted and hard work not always noticed."
good,"Showing up and perform your tasks. Management is cool at first, but then begin to command you to do no more, and certainly no less than what you are told. management will bark at you for not doing exactly what you were told (was probably just my store manager, who knows.)"
good,Busy and productive work days. Always learning something new and always assisting patients. Not much of down time. Always productive and getting things done.
good,The minimum pay is barely a living wage. The company does not allow enough hours to be used even at very high traffic locations. Only one pharmacist on weekends. Overall not meeting standards in comparison to other pharmacies
good,"No matter at what point of the day, the cashier will ALWAYS be the lone cashier.  "
good,I was hired as a pharmacy cashier and  quickly advanced to a pharmacy technician.  CVS/pharmacy had excellent on-the-job and classroom training when I was there.
good,CVS give you a fun and cool way to grow in the company. It give you daily and weekly challenges to help prepare you for your nest step in life. they also work with you.
good,Cvs gives little to no hours to stores. Most stores are understaffed and overworked. They do offer a lot of room to grow and develop a career. Good for a starter job.
good,"Heavy workload which was team orientated."
good,"High volume, fast paced stores. Structured goals. Very aggressive corporate culture focused on the bottom line. Performance based incentives-the more goals reached the greater the reward."
good,There is great satisfaction in helping the members.  You are assisting someone in getting their medications. You find joy in that even when the job's management is not enjoyable.
good,"Work environment was considerably higher stress, was more focused on metrics then actual patient care, did not feel safe in my license working at this company."
good,"Like every other corporate america company. Money comes first, employee health and saety second. Good benefits, bad treatment. Hard to advance in positions."
good,"Throughout the day you will cipher coupons and discuss weekly deals with customers while regulating flow of customers, cleaning, stocking, basically everything. When you start off you are expected to do everything and anything in a quick and efficient manner without much support."
good,"Depending on the day, CVS generally fills more prescriptions than it is prepared to fill. Hours are limited, so it is usually under-staffed, and the hiring process is loose, so even the majority of the staff are under-prepared. In general, if you know what you are doing, it advances your experience, because you are able to work a lot of management."
good,Too much is expected of the associates for little to no pay! It's a great job for anyone in HS trying to make some money. You can advance in the company if you want to be a part of the community for a long time.
good,the job used to be great and just seem things went down hill after we got moved in a different district and new mangement hours cut down of how many had per week and let a worker up front take schedule away from a pharmasit and do her way cut from the full time but not part time they keep there hours and some with 30 hours
good,"Just working here while I get get my degree in CS. My boss is great, but any management above him has no idea how a pharmacy operates. Complete disconnect."
good,"The company used to be a fun place to work, but upper management is getting far more into the numbers instead of taking care of the customers!! To me the customers should be number one and are far more important than anything. The company does not give us enough help to do our job correctly and to take care of the customers."
good,"under payed. every payday is the same, what can i afford, what can wait. wich bill has to be payed, and which bill can wait till next payday. hope my car dont break down, nothing saved to fix it."
good,"There were times it was a nice place to work.  For the most part it was a ""me"" culture.  No one wanted to really help you succeed.  The training didn't seem adequate."
good,"it was stressful and competitive, alot of favoritism and they rush you to do your job , tried to think of safety but they didnt let you at times ,i really loved my job as a stocker and should of stayed in that job cause it was less stressful and i did safety there the best cause you dont get pushed as hard"
good,"Got to learn about the workplace, how to fill. Timing when filling and when patients where waiting for their prescriptions. Learned patient and comprehension when having to deal with the patient's."
good,We are never really compensated for all of our hard work. We go there every day and bust our butts only for upper management to cut our hours as a whole.
good,I have enjoyed my years at CVS. My coworkers keep me coming to work. They are my family. CVS has taught my a lot. We have worked well together. Love my coworkers.
good,it's been a long time since I worked for CVS I really don't remember too much things besides the manager I didn't like and the hours were decent but they kept changing them and eventually I had to get a set schedule to let them know my availability.
good,"The pay to work ratio is not worth it. I made $9 an hour my starting year and had a large amount of responsibilities. I had to run the cash register, stock shelves, manage inventory, push inventory, answer phone lines, assist with the photo kiosks, and take passport photos. "
good,"I started working from home and the communications between supervisor and employee were horrible. I had to find out information through other coworkers. Also when a question arises, no one knows the answer and they just ""wing it"" per say, which is not a confident way to work."
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician was a rather easy job, but unfortunately at the time period we were short people. The job was rather fast pace and customers could be difficult to work with, but if you know how to provide good quality service and have patience it's not so bad!"
good,"I have worked at multiple stores, and all of them have a hostile environment. They do not work as a team and gossip constantly causing issues. They do not schedule enough staff per shift, making it impossible to complete required tasks."
good,"Looking at the overall experience it’s quick paced, friendly people, and gives good benefits.  Paid vacation after training and good management team. Can be stressful at times but lots of coaching"
good,"My job title was cashier and if you look on the CVS website and look at the job descrption keep in mind that you will be doing that and everything else under the sun. You will be taking invoices checking vendors in, running the photo center, ringing up customers, promoting the CVS card as well as coupons, and well as other things, you need to be a great multi tasker. I was making minium wage and with everything they had me doing I just didn't feel like I was getting paid what I was doing work for. Maybe if I had gotten a thank you at least every now and again I wouldn't be irritated about it but it is what it is."
good,"I loved my work at Accordant. But new management came in and health insurance was slashed. My husband's first fill of medications was going to cost $4000, and I had to look for another job. I miss my work there."
good,"Fast paced, must be willing to work hard, can be physically and mentally draining, a lot of pressure and stress, fair compensation and benefits. Not the best hours, especially in a 24 hour store"
good,Management needs some work and also so does HR team they never get back to the associates on time. They tend to give you lot of work but when it comes to advancement they don't consider.
good,"CVS offer good benefits, company promotes unlimited opportunities for all, but it depends on your luck. If you get good supervisor then you will be good. If not, it will be little difficult to work. Make sure your supervisors like you."
good,"You are graded by corporate on the silliest things when the more important thing is taking care of the patient in front of you is number 1. All calls must be made by a certain time so they must be made but you can’t ignore the patient in front of you. Which do you choose, what you’re graded on or the right thing to do? And you’re understaffed because you are underpaid and no one wants to work for low pay, so you must do it all by yourself. Low scores are not acceptable."
good,Staff at each store will determine your day or how things work for each store. Customers can be rude and aggressive when you can provide what they are asking for.
good,This job involved a lot of patient interaction.  It involve pharmacy tech work as well as cashier work. This is a great position for someone out of high school or currently in college.
good,"Customer Service,Stocking,Some Merchandising,Never enough Employees,Hardest part of the job,Unloading Truck. When I actually was able to Merchandise Creatively."
good,"Overworked daily, with long shifts and very little appreciation or help from other team members. Had late lunches or stayed over without even being asked to do so. Many if not all customers are rude and yell at you for things that are out of your control. Very little time for training but expected to know things in a day or two that usually take weeks/months to learn."
good,"Working at Coram Healthcare was fine when i first started. The manager at that time was great. In fact he recommended me for the job where he was working. Then came the new manager. We had 5 pharmacist, 4 pharmacy assistants, 4 pharmacy technicians, warehouse personnel ect.  One pharmacist had been their for over 20 years. Everyone left because of her stile of management."
good,No job stability. Needs to orient employees better. Management does not pass on reports or activities from shift to shift. Full time employment no longer available. Corporate wants employees to run and do multitasking jobs while on shift no excuse for not completing.
good,"Having had the opportunity to work with my CVS counterparts from retail to long term care as a Pharmacy Technician, I've been able to obtain more training and knowledge in this field. Personally, I've enjoyed my experience and most of all working along side great people.  The most challenging part of my job was making sure as a group we met our deadlines with providing prescriptions to our patients at their requested times.  Overall, my experience has been wonderful and would recommend people that may be interested working for CVS Health."
good,As a third party vendor for CVS under Alorica my schedule was flexible. Enjoyed helping people .Very educational. Able to use all aspects of customer service.
good,"CVS heath is a great company to work for but it depends on location. Management look down there nose at you and do not practice cvs culture. My dept is depressing. No fun, no interaction all business."
good,"There was little room for advancement in my role at CVS. I was cross trained in all areas of the pharmacy and front end, unlike most of the employees. The pay is terrible and noncompetitive."
good,"Great company to work for, many opportunities to excel throughout the company"
good,"Would mostly run register and greet customers"
good,"was there many years ago and I believe from my colleagues and friends it's even worse. I would go back if I had to to put food on the table and pay the mortgage. I think that should say it all. Not enough help. To many calls relative ti number of people to answer the calls, drive thru, both windows etc, The volume is ridiculous and they have cut the hours even more. There is not even pharmacist overlap anymore with pharmacists ringing up at the register half the time. Probably the most inefficient use of an expensive resource there is."
good,"You are responsible for billing up to 12 facilities. Which includes the knowledge of Medicare, Medicaid and Med D insurance. Great company with advancement but training needs a lot of work."
good,"Job was pretty good when i first started, been working with them for over a year now. Typical day at work up front is all about cashier work, stocking shelfs, doing damages and keep work station clean. Pharmacy you fill prescriptions, help customers, speak to doctor offices, figure out complications with insurance etc. Management is ok, I got screwed with hours because of communication. Few employees act like they are above their pay grade an try to make you do their job. BUT the pay is pretty good. The customers are pretty much regulars so its easy to get along with most of them and grow a bond."
good,"Typical day is set up for perpetual tasking for management. "
good,The work was extremely boring and monotonous. The facility was dark and dusty. The people were nice however very cut-throat in upper management. I do not recommend
good,"I enjoyed place of employment, however there was a never ending list of to do's. Not enough time to get everything needed done. Must be responsible and accountable, must be willing to finish other people's work."
good,"Licence Pharmacy Technician Georgia"
good,"With an ever growing patient base, CVS has failed to accommodate for its Technicians, as my pharmacist once said, ""Technicians are the backbone of this pharamcy."" The typical day starts of slow paced, but rapidly increases in things to do, people to manage, and not enough Technicians to help accomplish these tasks."
good,"educated members and potential members of the medicare prescription drug plan, and what plans they had to offer, enrolled them into the plan if they were interested"
good,not a bad company to work for but hours are never consistent. they make you work undesired hours. they are slightly stingy with pay and they have a tendency of overworking their employees
good,"CVS is by far the most stressful job that I have ever had.  Although it is very fast paced and you have to endure many different emotional patients, it will definitely help you learn and increase your skills as a pharmacy technician.  I would recommend working for CVS just for the learning experience but as far as pay and hours go I would look into a different company."
good,I have no comments about the company. No comment. They are flexible with schedules. I like that about the company. The management is great. I really don't have much to say about the company
good,I learned and done a variety of general office duties such as processing mail along with data entry and use of operating systems to verify member's health coverage with filing prescription claims.
good,CVS Specialty takes you through thorough training before you are welcomed onto the open floor. The lead of each team and the supervisor are welcoming and kind throughout the experience. There seems to be general irritation and drama on the floor. The company seems to make changes regularly without including detail as to how the changes are to be carried out. It is an easy job for the amount that you get paid and the opportunity for overtime is almost always available. I would say this is an average experience all things considered.
good,Fast paced work environment. Learned management skills. Helping patients with insurance problems/medication questions/OTC recommendations. Gratification from the job comes from helping these patients with day to day issues.
good,My manager and co workers made my time there pleasant. I really learned how to multitask. It was hard work but I had fun doing it. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,Working in retail pharmacy is always a somewhat stressful environment but most of the people I worked with were great. We never got scheduled breaks and would mostly just have to eat while working when I could sneak a bite or two. Pay is low average for a pharmacy tech.
good,In Illinois the pay is less than Indiana. I'm transferring from Illinois to Indiana and found out that they have a better pay. They also have many stores in Indianapolis and more job opportunities.
good,stressful yet rewarding work environment.  I learned a lot by working here and really enjoyed the people that I worked with.  You will learn a lot about health care and the pros/cons with health care.  You will also learn a lot about prescriptions.  Was definitely a good part-time job while in nursing school
good,"You get to meet new folks all the time in this field,  You have to be a self motivator and be able to work independently. Lots of independent work and fairly flexible with work hours"
good,"If you are just looking to make some money on the side and not a full time career. this is a good place, the pay is low, they do promote from inside but it takes awhile"
good,loved it except for manager of front store. just wasnt a very nice man at all just though about his self only. they had wounderful insurance and wounderful employees.
good,"Fast paced working environment where working independently is a must. Needed to be able to read prescriptions correctly to input and print out labels, fill the prescriptions for the customers. Needed to be able to contact the insurance companies if there was an issue as well as conversing with the patients/customers."
good,it is not your typical watch the clock retail.  There's always something to do and CVS puts all the emphasis on customer service.  I have developed a team first mentality and have built a culture where people want to work.
good,normal pharmacy operations and hasn't worked there in almost 6 yrs so I know things have changed and cannot speak to that enviroment anymore. fill medications and a lot of face to face customer service
good,"Each day poses new bureaucracy and red tape.  Management is layered so thickly so as to insulate the layer above without accountability of anything.  Innovations are met with reasons why things wont work rather than try something new.  Collaboration and teamwork is mostly unheard of.  Strong technical persons are often tasked with things that are beneath their capabilities.  For CVS it's all about the warm and fuzzy and seldom about the meat and potatoes of doing business with integrity, urgency and ethics."
good,"management wont do anything for people they dislike unless your one of their fews favorites that can sit in aux all day and not get looked at twice, the sups dont take phone calls so when you ask for assistance on a call they do not know how to assist you so it really fend for yourself and figure it on your own"
good,"Started off good the first two years I was there. The last year I was there it became stressful. New people made more money than the ones who've been working there, production was slow so management would send people home. Not a lot of advancement opportunities unless you were a managers favorite."
good,"I gained a lot of experience from working in the Pharmacy at CVS. However, at a certain point there is no room for growth, not enough positions to meet the needs of everyone."
good,"•	Assist with compounding of medications following company standards"
good,cvs is not the best place to work. they do not pay you as much as you deserve. they would rather work you to death than pay to have another person come in and help. would not recommend this job
good,There is no place for advancement or higher pay.  The management is incompetent and lacks structure. The hour can be long and tedious with no proper training and follow through from management when things do not go smoothly.
good,"I like the work and most of the people are reasonable and friendly.  The hard part is that departments are placed in contention with each other by design, because of the wide spread use of projects to implement change.  Time frames are very compressed and corners get cut."
good,"The training was very extensive, mostly about how to maneuver through the computer system. After training, you sat with an experienced Pharmacy Service Representative to shadow them for a few weeks, After that, you come in and go to your assigned cubical, plug in your headphones and start answering calls. This facility was for very specific pharmaceutical drugs, many which were inject-able, many were required to be refrigerated .  The workplace culture was way too quiet, and very micro managed.  Not everyone in a supervisory position was interested in being helpful . It was not an enjoyable environment. The hardest part was going to work. As a footnote, when Healthbridge closed, 4 of us were hired at CVS, ( not at the same time)  2 quit during the 2 week training, 1 quit within the 2 weeks after the training,  I lasted 4 months."
good,usually understaffed and stressful. Be prepared to work fast paced. Has to be willing to help people in a calm manner. Management was very helpful. CVS offers on the job training at different locations.
good,"The workplace morale was less than great. We had prearranged breaks and if your lunch time was too late, you weren't able to use the vendors. We had a strict dress code even though no customers saw us. Worling there is not for the faint at heart."
good,"A typical day of work consists of all the roles a pharmacy has for a technician. You type, fill prescriptions answer phones, call Doctors office for refills or insurance companies with billing issues, sell prescriptions, inventory our section and place orders, call list of customers for refill and other pharmacy related questions."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to communicate and help patient on a personal level.  It is a challenging job and would definitely required skills of multi-tasking.  The work day is pretty constant with phones calls to insurance companies, patients, and  clinics. The hardest part of the job is trying to do everything when you are alone and are needed at multiple places."
good,"Be prepared for long hours even if you tell them you can't work for that long; they don't consider your availability!"
good,"Fortune 7 company with worse management team, low salary and need to work overtime up to 80 hours without overtime payment and lots of red tapes. you need weekly approval from management to do your routine job role!"
good,7 Months plus and still no one to be hired. I feel overworked. management can care less in how I feel as long as the work get a done. management only cared about numbers rather than the person who's putting up the numbers.
good,CVS Phoenix is a brand new full service billing revenue site which condensed 5 other sites across the nation into this one building. Within a year of being year management and leadership changes monthly if not more often. Their is no structure to management and lack of internal advancement.
good,There was a lack of attention paid from management to employees. I requested coaching and did not receive it. Instead I was disciplined for errors I made.
good,"lots of hours, co workers were nice. Management could of been better. It was very tough work but we usually worked as a team. The managers could have been nicer to theyre employees."
good,"CVS pharmacy is a great job for high school or college students"
good,It's ok very fast paced constantly busy have to be a fast learner and have a lot of patience to deal with customers and coworkers due to high stress work environment
good,Can be fast paced with the focus on production and accuracy. You may be required to work additional hours and on your scheduled day off.  Work most holdiays.
good,"The workflow is very fast-paced. There are sudden stretches of rush hours where a herd of patients come in. During the ""down time"", you are filling prescriptions, calling for refills, and talking to patients over the phone."
good,This a great place to start out for the Technician not looking to begin in the retail environment. They provide basic pharmacy technician training and is a good stepping stone to larger opportunities.
good,"It was a job when I couldn't find another one, but I would not recommend working here. Seems like any other pharmacy would be better and pay better. Not so bad once I was promoted to lead tech, but that took a year and then I was already maxed out as far as advancement with the company."
good,Maybe its my location but its a little unorganized and lacks communication. My location has a lot of chaos and stealing by the customers so you have to watch and do  your job at the same time. Management tend to allow outside situations to determine how they react or treat their employees. Its hard as a 24hr store to get work done and ring all the customers up all night.
good,Cvs have me a good learning experience multi tasking and have a extremely quick mind set. It made me a better person to show what great customer service is about.
good,It’s and ok job for someone in High School or starting college but if you looking for a long term job then this is not the job for you unless you looking to move high up into the company cvs only cares about their customer they can careless about the employees
good,"Working at CVS is really stressful and fast paced. I love working there because the people I work with a great and my manager is awesome. However, the company itself is really hard to work with and are not great about advancement opportunities and pay raises."
good,The retail experience overall is stressful when it comes to pharmacy.  The individual must be headstrong and flexible.  However CVS practically runs a sweat shop and only certain stores are shown favoritism.  Communication from employees to upper management seems to go in one eat and out the other.  Unless you are a pharmacist or better this is not a place to build your career around.
good,"High pace environment which can get stressful. Always understaffed. Pay could be better. No real lunch break, and expected to do work when you are at home. Unplanned last minute early morning conference call."
good,"The management expected to work 12 - 16 hours per day, however the daily production mostly completed in 8 - 10 hours. The meeting are scheduled after hours that forces management members to stay longer hours what negatively impact the work - life balance. "
good,"I would come n and immediately begin work after after speaking to y co-workers. We were pretty much busy all day. Sometimes we got crazy customers but most of them were nice. It was a new environment for me but I liked it for the most part. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do the insurance or billing part of the job,"
good,it was a fast paced environment but the manager was definitely workable with. Very little hours and no room for growth within the company. Had a difficult experience with one of the pharmacist but even he was just trying to do his job
good,"- High demand environment "
good,"very busy work place with a lot of challenges"
good,It is extremely hard to find work-life balance.  They are very busy and don't want to hire when volume increases.  Staff are expected to work as many hours as are needed to get results.
good,"Accounts were assigned each day to work."
good,"Being a tech is rough work.  Trying to fill the dozens of prescriptions at any given time is the easy part.  The issue comes in when dealing with anyone who's prescription either wasn't covered by insurance, or was hardly covered."
good,"Management is afraid of the top bullies in the branch. Aside from that its an ok place to work as long as you don't get in the way of the clique. The management will be fine once they find ppl who are task driven and focused on the work at hand. Although I did not work with the clique, I've seen first hand the destruction they have brought on the pharmacist, sales and customer service reps first hand."
good,CVS is a good company to work for but I feel that the culture and age of some of the pharmacist within the company makes it difficult to maintain a professional work relationship. Lots of politics are involved in getting hours.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility of working from home or in the office.  Having kids and having them sometimes get sick, allows me to be home with them, but still work via my laptop."
good,"The job was easy, you just don't get many hours they cut back so and can not live off 28 a week. Managers was ok they get there hours but the employee don't."
good,"A typical day was what you'd expect at a Fortune Top 10 corporation: a fast paced, change intensive environment. CVS Health is a Prescription Benefit Manager, with a ""Who's Who"" list of corporations as clients. Subsequently, there were daily client interactions, and support activities, including managing the resolution status of routine to complex requests, and with a focus on client/customer service, working with both internal and external partners. Great learning environment. Great people. Not so great pay."
good,It was a fun place to work. They don't like it when you call out on behalf of the doctors or family emergencies. And yell at you all the time. Overall it's a horrible place to work.
good,"As a pharmacy tech there are a lot of responsibilities you are in charge with. CVS trained their employees at one central store where they explained the basics, but did not actually put you for on the job training for hands on experience; this would occur on your actual first day at your own store. Once in the pharmacy, there were so many things to do that the employees there did not have time to train others properly."
good,"Used to be a great place to work, aside from a manager who repeatedly under-appreciates his workers. Has recently gotten worse with upper level management reducing individual store budgets, forcing store to cut workers while maintaining and even increasing work load."
good,The company has changed to a culture of metrics and goals. There is an expectation that anything below target is unacceptable regardless of the circumstances that may be preventing you from making target.
good,Bittersweet experience. Grateful for the opportunity to work in such an environment as a newbie technician. However the stress and demands were no joke. It's not for the faint of heart.
good,"best thing about the company is the benefits. They are amazing! Depending on where you work, the hours are good. (call center) Management is not reliable nor are they helpful. Training was definitely not sufficient for the work we were performing."
good,"Working here was a great learning experience. I lived the entire perception lifecycle inputing, insurance verification, production, and customer checkout."
good,I rather not sure the negative and degrading situations within the store. But big time manager problem creating a high school like environment and very negative and hostile environment. There is no balance when it comes to your life and work. what has been told to you is that your job comes first and everything else is last attitude especially when it comes to family or other personal issues.
good,"When i first started working here it was fully staffed. One by one people started leaving and corporate never replaced them. They started cutting hours, lines and wait times started getting longer. It was fun in the beginning even though it was busy, being i worked in the 24hr store. At one point i worked several shifts where it was just 1 pharmacist and myself to work weekends!"
good,I would recommend CVS Minute Clinic to NPs that are looking to retire. Not for new grads who may want to use all of the information they learned in school.
good,"despite working in a fast pace environment that requires customer service skills and a good amount of on the job learning, when minimum wage in my state went up our wages didn't increase parallel to that. this has resulted in me working less than 50 cents above minimum wage for a rather advanced position. additionally, the focus on numbers puts stress on pharmacists and staff, resulting in a mix of customer satisfaction and customer annoyance."
good,"CVS is such a big company yet underpays their technicians. A lot of work but little pay, sometimes the customers can be tough and you have to remain calm"
good,"While working at CVS Health isn't rocket science, it sure is a lot more work than $9/hr can justify. It is much better than fast food I'll give it that, but the day to day tasks become mundane and repetitive after a while. Stock this, straighten that, ring up the customers, the days seem to blend together at this point. There's no real high points working here, while it is ""easy"" money, it's certainly not enough money to support a decent standard of living. Although if you're just looking for a second job where you don't want to work your way up the corporate ladder for 40 sum years, and you just need some extra money while doing minimal albeit similar work everyday, then CVS may be the place for you. Now if you're looking for an exciting career, where you have something different to do everyday, and things change on a daily basis, CVS Health is not that place. I personally have worked all shifts possible (mornings, midday, evenings, and primarily overnights), and it's almost all the same, with overnights being the most work (stocking shelves, putting away fairly heavy (10-30lbs) totes on truck night, cleaning the entire store, straightening shelves, and everything to make the store pretty for the morning all with one person), all at the same pay rate. Plus there's really no job security so if you complain, screw up, or ask too many questions they can give you the boot like that. But overall, I'd give it about an average on a scale of 1-banana."
good,"great co-workers"
good,"honestly working here sucked, customers, even management was RUDE! Because i was an intern they had me do all the work that they didnt want to do.!!!!"
good,"Did not have opportunity to meet upper management due to the main office being located out of state."
good,"Even though i thought this job was boring and unexciting, I do have to say that for my first job it was just ok. There was nothing special about it, the managers some what cared for everyone. But like I said it was a good first job I think I would kill myself if I kept working there."
good,Communication could be better. Supervisors don't let you know how you are doing in a timely manner. Overtime became excessive and required and was not told that 15 hours of OT would be required when hired.
good,"Out of the 3 CVS stores I've worked in, 1 has very unprofessional and the employees including the manager lacks proper training. The other 2 although they ran smoothly for the most part, the actual employees weren't the nicest. CVS doesn't seem to care as much to ensure you receive the proper training that you need to pass the exam, I've had to ask to be trained to ensure that I succeed here."
good,"would recommend working at cvs if you want to get trained with stressful environment as most if the work environment are like that now a days, few chances to grow, so recommend this for experience purpose."
good,Great work environment. Supervisors really care about workers. Customers are sometimes irritable but you have to remember that they are dealing with sickness. Very fast paced.
good,We would arrive to work and have a team meeting every morning. When meeting is done we will grab our load diagrams which gives us our numbers for the day. Then we would go to the doors assigned to us. We would clean up and then when the sorter starts to run we begin our loading process.
good,Everyone is friendly here and helpful. Great teamwork skills is a must and you must be super fast and multitask. Benefits are great too. the hardest part is dealing with customers.
good,The overall company is ok to work for it is the management that need more training with communicating with their employees.  They need to make sure they include Human Resources with changes there was a big disconnect when it came to promoting and providing increases.
good,"I worked here for an externship for a pharmacy tech program that I was enrolled in. It wasn't a bad experience, just not for me. Not sure what compensation is there, but the job culture was pretty relaxed and friendly."
good,It's an okay place to work. It's very unorganized. Not enough work coming into the warehouse. Most importantly management is very pushy when it comes to prouductivity.
good,"Good place to work.  Plenty of opportunity for advancement.  Pay was very competitive.  Benefits were good, but a little expensive.  Work life balance was good."
good,I have a job and it keeps a roof over my head I have bee there for 3 years and the changes since CVS bought them are going down hill. I am not sure about our future there.
good,"CVS/Pharmacy is a challenge in most of their pharmacies. If you can make it there you can make it anywhere. The pharmacies are extremely fast paced. The hardest part of the job is just keeping up with the work flow. My suggestion is to always keep yourself moving about and being trained at all the different stations such as pick-up, drop-off and production. If you don't, you will not get the all-around experience you need to move on to a different pharmacy, ie; Hospital pharmacy."
good,"Decent Job, yet the pay is not at all competitive. The most enjoyable part of this job is having an amazing staff to work with, in addition to providing quality customer service to others"
good,A typical day at CVS is just like every other working day. Great Co-workers and a decent working atmosphere. Management is great and they work with our schedule.
good,Is very busy work is enjoyable.I learned to be very caring for peoples situations. I manage my time very well. I enjoy my customers. I aim for excellence. The hardest part of the job is seeing the prices of the medication for people that have no insurance so I will go the extra mile and put the discount insurance that we offer if not I will take the time and explain to the customers to go online and find a coupon.
good,The pay was great. Typical work days were very busy but I did learn a lot of helpful things to advance my career in Pharmacy Technician!!!!! I learned a lot about the pharmacy business!!!1
good,Daily work includes a lot of physical stamina.  Bending and picking up 10 to 50 lbs.  Management does not always relay the pertinent information needed to perform my job.  The culture varies from store to store.  The hardest part is making the customer happy.  The most enjoyable part is having a customer say and call the helpline to report a good experience with you personally
good,"Absolutely adore the job, but when I say you run your butt off you really do. There is never a dull moment. Great field to work in. It has a large lack of organization, communication, and of management keeping their word to employees."
good,It is a very different environment for nursing to work and report to pharmacy. I am fortunate to have a pharmacy manager who supports me in my role as a Nurse Specialist. There is not 'typical' day. The work I do and the people I support can change the day in a moments notice which makes it challenging and allows me to use all my skills to manage and succeed
good,Turned out to be a data entry job where you have to stand all day.  Didn't get many breaks. Customers can be rude and we were constantly understaffed.  Not a bad place to work but not what i expected.
good,"As a company in general, providing a service to the huddled masses is a positive one. When it comes down to the treatment of the employees it's not something to be desired."
good,Its a great job for those who love to learn daily. The hardest part for many may be the pace because everything is fast paced In the pharmacy. The most important  aspect about the job that I enjoy is having a positive impact on each and every customer.
good,"My experience was that I loved the work and it can be very rewarding helping people, but CVS doesn't give management enough hours to have enough people working and so you're always behind schedule and people get nasty about waiting for their medication. I've had coworkers run to the bathroom crying far too many times."
good,"I was able to help many people, especially the elderly. my job was to assist customers with their pharmaceutical orders. very team oriented company, family friendly."
good,"Here we filled prescriptions, about 3,000 per week as one of the regions largest stores in terms of production.  It required team work and the ability to multitask."
good,"My first 20 years of employment with the company was amazing . The upper management made you feel important and were very thankful for your hard work . The last 3 years there have been a lot of management changes and it hasn't been the same . hard work goes very unappreciated, I feel like the company overall wants to weed out the full time employees who have dedicated many years to the company to bring in people off the street for less pay . And there really is no room for advancement."
good,"Hours are constantly being cut, No standard for discipline. Nice people to work with. It is hard to work for people who only care about the numbers. There is little sense of teamwork."
good,"I worked at several locations. Some had delightful coworkers, customers, and managers, while others were terrible and soul-sucking. It really depends on your exact location and clientele, so it'd be worth checking out or having some critical thinking in regards to the neighborhood when selecting locations. "
good,"Pay is a pro, but overall expectations and stress levels are cons.  Benefits are adequate, but expect better from a healthcare provider."
good,"If you're able to stand being regularly abused by customers for situations that you did not cause and do not have the power to fix, and then to be expected to smile through it and try ever-harder to meet ridiculous performance metrics that have nothing to do with actually making the customers happier, then this is the job for you!"
good,CVS is definitely an organization that promotes growth within the company and allows there employees to explore their options as to what the company has to offer.
good,I never knew nurses could be so rude. I thought there was some kind of personalities test you had to take top get a license... not show how they got theirs.
good,Fun place to work. Must be very resourceful and be able to locate binders that explain the process of certain job duties. They will give you a raise upon evaluation.
good,"Learned all the medications in the pharmacy, what they're used for, wrote in data for patients, collected scripts, called insurance offices and doctor offices"
good,the boss I had mazen was always so focused on the negative stuff . he has never thanked me or anyone else for the hard work we do. although cvs is a great company
good,"People here are not that happy and I finally know what it means when they say ""it's a dog eats world."" People here will do anything to get to the top, it was like high school all over again. There is nepotism and it was unprofessional at times."
good,"The pay was good, management was unprofessional.. Benefits was very expensive. Lots of favoritism with employee and management. In house job advancement was not offer they always hired someone for new positions. When this company was going out of business management kept denying this matter to employees who would inquirer due to rumors."
good,"Its usually always busy, hands on job. It is nice to help assist customers and make sure that they're taking care of. The more you work in the pharmacy the more you get to know and be familiar with drugs, doctors, and insurance companies. The hardest part of the job was keeping the inventory in stock, and making sure we had everything to fit customers needs."
good,"Maybe it's just my location, but the pharmacist manager does not care about your personal life or situation. A loved one had to go to the ER unexpectedly one morning and I forgot to call in. I got scolded and called ""inconsiderate"" even though I explained the situation. When a friend or family member is in the ER, there's so many things I'm thinking about and CVS is not up there. "
good,"Typical day, back to back phone calls, different problems each call. Hardest part of the job is actually not able to assist the members by anyway, or even breaking bad news. Management is very micromanage, not friendly, and intimidating."
good,"with this job it opened up my eyes to other possibilities. I recommend especially to those who aren't sure about becoming a pharmacist, its a great way to understand what will be asked from you."
good,This job is very much a team job so you have to be able to work with people of all paths. Being a polite multitasker is key for this kind of work. Just smile and you'll breeze through.
good,"Loved what I did but not who I worked for. Management was only concerned about himself. I was more than qualified for a promotion, but a male was selected over me."
good,Responsibilities are endless. Most management team members are great and work well together. Overall a decent place to work.
good,"Typical day would be making sure the aisles are clear of debris before we open the doors to the public and delegating tasks to the cashier and I do opening routines such as register drawers, price changes, paper work, filling more product on the shelves and most important, helping our customers. Hardest part of the job is being a punching bag for customers already mad before walking in our store and wanting to take it out on someone, anyone. Have to put up with harsh moments. Also hard when a member of management calls in sick and you have to stay an extra four hours to six hours to cover there shift since we are not given a lot of hours for our store. Most enjoyable part of the day is talking with our regular customers who you see almost on a daily basis."
good,"CVS Pharmacy has very good benefits for their employees. However, retail is not always a pleasant environment. The staff and managers I worked with were amazing. The district managers were not so accommodating and did not value their employees."
good,"I spent about 10 years with the company as well as many of my family members and friends having multiple years there. It is an entry level job with no experience required. I learned everything about pharmacy based on what i learned while at the store. As a lead technician a lot of responsibility is placed on you even if you have no control over some of the aspects. Not the greatest pay and higher up management act as though they are above you. The company changed a lot throughout the years that i was there. I left because the company was going in a direction that i did not care for, moving towards production yet cutting hours instead of the best customer service you could give."
good,"Depending on location, it can be very busy. You will learn how to do everything, and it is very fast-paced. The company itself isn't very employee-focused. Benefits aren't great, and hours especially holiday hours are being changed to longer opening hours. Pharmacists here work very hard, and rarely have breaks. It is also very hard to find great long-staying technicians as well. Their pay rate isn't high."
good,"A typical day at work involves being able to multi-task quickly yet efficiently while providing excellent customer service. Very many patients come in upset over unresolved prior authorizations or insurance discrepancies, so be prepared to handle these patients with the best set of customer service skills regardless of any negative demeanor they may possess towards you. You will be very busy and slammed while trying to do multiple things accurately at once, so be prepared to handle all of the stress and pressure."
good,this is a great place to go when you are unsure what you are doing with yourself. its also great for those with minimum education or those in school bettering themselves
good,Working in the PA Admin department has been challenging for the last 3 years.  We have experienced 3 different directors in 3 years.  Advancement opportunities for management is limited.  Difficult to maintain work life balance with the demanding operational needs. Enjoyed working with employees who are easy to get along with and built long lasting relationships.
good,"My time working at CVS/Pharmacy i always gained a close relationship with the people who filled their prescriptions at the location i was working at. the managers only cared about their numbers and i understand, but where i work, i like to know my patients."
good,Working at CVS was a good start foundation as a new technician. The store I worked at did about 600 scripts per day. Their training was very helpful and I did learn a lot. But their policies aren't great.
good,Company is run too much as a retail pharmacy since CVS took over. Very limited growth once in the company and pay is below average compared to similar markets.
good,"Working for CVS Caremark as a medical biller was rewarding because I learned another skill set, which was how to bill pharmaceutical medication. I nhad a good working relationship with the staff, they were like family, eager to help and patient. The hardest part was learning their billing system. The most enjoyable part was the staff."
good,"working for CVS was no different then actually visiting a cvs. "
good,My company of employment building is over a million square ft with several departments. It take a huge workforce to keep it operational.my department is instrumental in keeping all the wheels turning at this facility. There is not much down time at this facility. I enjoy my job because it is laid back with no pressure. However I do not think I am being paid enough for my skills and qualifications.
good,"Once a new pharmacist was put in, the pharmacy had changed. Nothing is going smooth like it was, our DM put it one of his friends that isn't doing a good job. Many customers complaining about management and us co workers very upset and pushed to the limit. Very good at discrimination as I am 3 months pregnant and was forced to take leave or fired due to serious complications."
good,They hire to many young adults that do not take there job seriously. Some management place there work load on you as you have your own assignments to complete.
good,Great pay and benefits. Work load is high considering the amount of help given. Typical work day can be very stressful with the many tasks required by management.
good,"A typical day of work requires filling prescription, followed by helping patients ring-up their personal purchases as well as medicine. I have learned proper time management skills along with proper communication skills to complete goals appointed by the Pharmacist on duty. The hardest aspect of the work is the daily rushes of patients during our flu season, some times our staff is short on scheduled workers and this can cause a lack of prescription production due to the demand of prescription on the shift. I enjoy helping patients when they come into the pharmacy and want to drop off their prescription. this give me a sense of knowing each patient personally."
good,"pay could be better, but day is typically busy and goes by quickly. You learn a lot that can help you gain future positions and grow professionally."
good,"I began as a call center rep and was promoted to the resource planning team, then promoted to a second level resource coordinator before obtaining the supervisor position at CVS. It is a good place to work if you want the opportunity to advance within the company and free classes to advance your education and job knowledge. I learned so much at CVS and I am able to use those skills and experience in other career options."
good,"CVS Health is an okay place to work, not the best. Co-workers are okay but everywhere you go is not perfect. The most enjoyable part of my job is my patients. They are great!"
good,"It's a great neighborhood, the employees there are really nice. The only down side is the snobs that live there. They do not know how to spread out hours in the store."
good,"This job doesn't have any benefits really, no health care coverage, no union, no 401k or retirement plans. Friendly staff, friendly management in most locations."
good,"Cvs is a fun place to work. You are working with people in the community, and helping the people of the community. "
good,"Great job  acquired while in college. Very fast paced, must be able to multitask and be able to understand the work environment fast."
good,"This job was an okay job, it was a new sight when I bean so things were scattered. bad  management, too young of a crowd working there. job not a career"
good,I have learned processing of prescriptions and the hardest part will be not being able to fulfill the patients due to bad communication with mural parties. Example: insurance companies
good,"CVS Health is a very large company and your experience with the company will depend on your location.  If you work for the PBM Caremark, you will be working with multiple clients,if you work in retail your experience will be on a different level."
good,"I was guaranteed full time with benefits and never received it. After complaining to their ethics line after a year, I finally received a call from someone who seemed like they cared, to try and resolve the issue but the damage was already done"
good,The work load was overloaded. The most unpleasant part of the job was how the old employees treated the new ones. Technician roles were dictated amongst the technicians them selves and distributed very unevenly.
good,"This job is nothing special, especially if you already have management experience. CVS isn't tailored for the younger generations, but is trying to attract them through internships and fancy iPad apps, which aren't the best anyways. It's a decent stepping stone job for something better."
good,I learned quite a bit about the Medicare system and auditing. I also learned how to compose efficient problem solving work instructions.The most enjoyable part of the job was being there for my customers.
good,"Working at CVS Health is very regular. Just get working done go on brake and get back to work pretty much, Not very fun. Everybody was nice but employees use to work on their own according to what the manager assigned to do. Overall it was a nice work experience"
good,The co-workers were the most enjoyable part of this job. The computer system is not user friendly and difficult to work with.  Communication is something that can be improved upon.
good,I enjoyed working at Omnicare my day consisted of mainly data entry work. Advancement and growth opportunity was minimal. My coworkers were very nice!
good,"good facility but low compensation and benefit."
good,"Company has great ideas and ideals, but they are poorly implemented and executed. They do not recognize innovative individuals"
good,"Excellent team work training."
good,"A decent place to work if you have no obligations such as family, school and or dependents.There is room for advancement that compensates for the lack there of in other areas. Management dose well to engage with other departments attempting to boost moral. overall if you have given Caremark 5 plus years you will have more room for leniency oppose to someone with less time worked."
good,"Seems to be a lot of overhaul being done within the company. CEOs are changing, people are suing but facilities are being added. It's weird but they have work if you need it."
good,CVS is growing and doing really well as a corporation. The are several departments that's great to work for. They should seek to improve the department of training and management.
good,Everyone was to serious all about work. I would rather be around a group of not o up tight kind of people all type of age group.
good,I love helping people and making them feel better. I get along just fine with all of my co workers and would miss them terribly
good,Cant really get much done with all the constraints set by EA and the paperwork. Only about 30% of my time is spent actually developing.
good,"Consistency is something that barely exists. Management tries to make improvements, but seem to be complacent with mediocrity both from all employees and themselves. I know I do not want to do this job, or work in this environment the rest of my life. Technicians are criticized most often than praised for the jobs they do. Things would be so much worse if the hard working & dedicated employees that do work here walked away which is what this location deserves."
good,"Its very fast paced, a lot of demand, hard work, hard work, hard work, changes from one day to the other, a lot of over the shoulder looking"
good,"Learn how to complete planograms. Gave customers excellent customer service. Knowledge of the store policy, and the products. Must know the HIPPA policy and the importance of enforcing required actions. Organization of the store,labeling,and proper storing ."
good,I learned how to become a better manager by taking on a bigger role at each store I worked at. Most of the employees are laid back and easy going.
good,"It's understandable how CVS has grown to be the size it is considering their demand for time and perfection from their colleagues."
good,I was usually alone in the photo center in the mornings and went back and forth from photo center to front counters. Seemed like it was hard to keep people employed.
good,"I enjoy working directly with the customers, providing pharmaceutical care, however, we have a limited time frame to provide all the necessary information to the patient. "
good,If you don't have a good team to work with you won't have much fun at work. I enjoy this job strictly because of the chemistry me and my team have developed.
good,"Good starting position for a career, great benefits, and job security. The management is not involved in employee communication and the work is front loaded and must be done in a certain time frame."
good,"The pharmacy I worked at was busy 24/7.  It was a 24 hour store.  On a typical day I would arrive in the morning and file prescriptions, and make phone calls to Dr. offices about medication refills.  When I was not doing that I would put up the medications on the shelves.  Meanwhile I was to attend customers in the store and in drive thru. At times another co-worker would work up front and I would be helping the pharmacist count pills and label bottles to be dispensed.  The hardest part of this job had to be working as a team to accomplish our varied tasks. We had a good team, but we had to adjust routinely to different leadership styles of different pharmacists.  Each one seemed to have a different way of running things."
good,"loved the challenging work but upper management people made it a difficult place to work for"
good,This a place to start if you are looking to break into the pharmaceutical field. It will show you what high volume retail is all about.
good,i have enjoyed working for this company. it has given me opportunities to advance and better my career. i also was available for me to transfer when my husband had to change duty stations
good,There were good times and not so good times...most recently no so good.  Culture is all about the company...no programs for employee growth.
good,"If you love retail, CVS Health is for you. Interacting and helping customers, coaching and developing employees, stocking, budgeting, scheduling , running a typical retail store including pharmacy."
good,"CVS pays well vs. the market"
good,"over all good place,but under paid,never know how long you will be working that day,under staffed in the department,,2nd shift workers good,some break downs hard,people that work on the floor are good people"
good,next patient. aways is the bank@ job but had a good team@the branch. We were helping people and manufacturer had been oart of team at times.
good,"A typical day at CVS was busy we always had something to do, i learned different programs and i learned how top work with different people in different states."
good,"Working retail pharmacy was a lot like working in a restaurant but you had to be the hostess, cook, waitress and restaurant manager. When it came down to it, yes, you do have the customers that make you wonder why is it even worth it but then you have the few that treat you like their family. Just like any job, there are hiccups with miscommunication, but you get over it and solve the problem. CVS as a whole is a good company to work for but being such a national company, employee consideration has fallen by the wayside. In my years of being with the company, my compassion and patience has blossomed. I have learned from my customers that it could always be worse and not to take life for granted. Mind you, not all customers had a smile on their face but you learn to spread the kindness. Being a tech for 4 years retail gave me a lot of insight regarding drug companies and medication in itself, especially compared to ten years ago."
good,"One of the reasons why I love my job is because of my co-workers. They are all great. I've learned a lot about pharmacy and truly love the job. Dealing with patients is both the best and worst part of the job. Being a pharmacy technician is not only dealing with customer service & counting pills, but it is also an understanding of laws, regulations, and pharmaceuticals. You don't just count pills in this job, which is a wide misconception. This job is stressful. But, if you have the right team, you can make it work."
good,"very stressful at times, but love what i do as a pharmacy technician help customers dealing with insurance Dr calls, as well as input of data entry, patient refills, filling prescriptions. My co worker are great we work together as a team without teamwork the retail pharmacy can get crazy but they are such a pleasure to work with."
good,This job is typical. The manager enjoyed belittling the employees beneath his pay grade. I loved my coworkers. They were helpful and encouraging.
good,Odd schedules and change frequently. Can be stressful due to requirements and call volume. Management definitely has a favoritism issue.
good,"Typical day at work you receive calls and handle them accordingly. Each plan has their out set of rules that you need to follow certain procedures differently than other. Some days you will experience heavy call volume so you will talk non-stop, and the people here are cool for the most part."
good,Good hours for carers but some disadvantages and rude owner. I think it could be a much better company with a few improvements! Clients are shaggy and pathetic.
good,"Overall, working at CVS was just a job and never meant to be a career. However, it did get my foot in the door into the pharmacy world. Retail pharmacy can be extremely stressful at times dealing with inpatient customers (most of whom are sick and needing medicine) but it can also be extremely rewarding when you feel the satisfaction of truly helping someone. The particular store I worked at had a somewhat laid back environment but was also hostile at times due to some of the co-workers (so obviously not ALL of the CVS's will be that way). The work volume also fluctuates from being extremely busy to being extremely slow. There weren't really opportunities to advance within the company because there aren't too many positions available without going to a corporate location."
good,"While I really enjoyed my co-workers and the professional relationships that I developed while at CVS, the expectations were not always reasonable.  A number of my coworkers have left the company recently because they felt that the quality of life would be better at a different company."
good,"CVS is a great company , but sadly doesn't provide security for professional growth.  Is good for students part timers because the company doesn't provide full time opportunity for Certified Pharmacy Technicians"
good,"Long 14 hour shifts required. Great amount of pressure in keeping positive numbers for performance measures."
good,"This job was a lot of fun, I learned a lot about various products, However, do to no fault of the management team, the job is also very stressful. Continuous running around from the moment you walk in the door. Not uncommon to stay several hours late."
good,My time at CVS Health was an experience i will never forget i have learned a great deal about the values of hardwork. The management at CVS was often times very easy to deal with i never felt out of place and they were always open for communication. I feel that i was lucky to have some of the best co workers they were all friendly and hardworking and i consider some of  them to be very good friends. The hardest part of the job would be at times having to perform multiple tasks at once the company is greatly understaffed and that can bring a great amount of difficulty to the job. Working with a great staff was something that made some of the stress of the job much more manageable and what i learned from my coworkers i will never forget.
good,"Was rushed through training but expected to know how to use all the resources.  Not good on time off, not family friendly, mandatory overtime during January and February with certain amount of hours you have to work on Mondays because it's the busiest. The pay and benefits are okay and some of the other employees are very nice. I don't think I would recommend this place to any of my friends."
good,"•	Responsible for the Biogen account handling benefits investigations and prior authorizations "
good,"All about the numbers Everyone is very stressed and have to hide it and keep all your numbers high to comply with their new contracts. Mandatory over time. Training does not provide practical applications."
good,"I worked with a great crew and we became a family but there is a huge disconnect between corporate and employees.  It take too long for anyone to get hired (average 2 months) so we had no help when we needed it the most.  I moved out of state and could not transfer to a full time position so I could not get a conventional mortgage, making me pay more and no guarantee of a job.  HR didn't seem to know what they were doing when I needed items for mortgage.  Needless to say, I am no longer working for them due to this incompetence and their lack of loyalty to an employee who has been there over 3 years and had great customer service ratings.  When you are missing 2 or more employees and you are in a very busy pharmacy, you end up missing deadlines and because of this, the pharmacy will get rated poorly and NOT qualify for another employee.  This only makes valued employees and the customers angry.  The other issue is the bonuses the big bosses get for saving money rather than customer service and productivity.  The benefits were ok but I had an emergency and now the ins doesn't want to pay for it stating it is not an emergent issue.  I would have more than likely died as a result of not having the surgery.  All in all, the staff at the store and pharmacy level is great and really wants to give their all but upper management has no idea what is really needed to get the job done or don't care."
good,Not enough time in the day to complete the assigned tasks. Under staffed on a daily basis. Often working alone during peak business hours.
good,"The only issue I had is I was laid off one day, overall CVS was a good place to work. I was given the opportunity to advance and I did."
good,"CVS has a fantastic training program for pharmacy technicians.  Starting out with no previous pharmacy experience, I was provided with mountains of literature and course work to help me become comfortable and confident in the working environment.  They continually provide online company courses to keep you current on practice laws and regulations within the company.  "
good,Corporate has cut hours and added to the workload creating an environment that is no longer enjoyable or realistic at times. At the store level I love my PIC and coworkers
good,it is a very busywork practive. i had a supportive team with hard working people.I've learned many skills and practices .
good,"Good:"
good,greatest job ever. Company very customer/employee oriented.  Love the hustle. Couldnt ask for a better place to work. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,Very tough company to work for. The salary was also way too low. The benefits were also sub par. I would not recommend anyone work here
good,"pharmacy department was busy, with inadequate equipment "
good,a place where I gained a lot of experience and made me successful in my job role now and in roles to come I would recommend on entry level basis.
good,"There is a great work life balance here as you have the option to work from home a couple days a week.  This makes life and work more enjoyable (which is the most enjoyable part).  The atmosphere is very laid-back, however there are a lot of politics (as with any big corporation).  The most difficult part of the job are the client facings meetings since some of my clients are difficult."
good,It is a great workplace if you are looking for temporary work because the management sucks. The benefits are great if you are a full time employee.
good,"Come into work, listen to my voicemail, make sure all the patient that need their medication that day gets there medication as soon as possible without problems, make sure the medications pays under either the prescription plan or the medical plan, continue with the patients that were assigned to me, get on the queue and take calls, help other patients who aren't assigned to me, run claims through insurance, run compounds in a system called CE2000, call medical plans to see if medications are covered, call and find out benefits for the patient and schedule patients medications once benefits been verified. The most enjoyable part of my day is fertility patients getting their medication once they need them. The hardest part of my job is letting a patient know that they have no coverage under their insurance and will have to pay out of pocket for their medications. Sometimes patients don't have enough money to pay for medications."
good,"management will schedule around your schedule, little room for advancement and raises, job seekers will learn how to sack and maintain store cleanliness"
good,"basic IT work environment where majority of our time were trouble shooting over the phone with technicians. List of our provided supports ranges from software to actual hardware problem, were u have to be able to adjust to each situation and identify the issues at hand."
good,I accepted a full time position on the knowledge that my job would benefit my patients. instead the work piled up so much that when I asked for help none was given. I am in the position now where I don't even know who is my supervisor. no communication and no support. the impact it's causing my patients I need to be in place where I can postively benefit people and help them.
good,Some training issues are what is lacking at this job and does not seem to be getting better anytime soon. Heavy favoritism by management who are friends with fellow employees.
good,very high paced enviroment with little to no help. no stable hours can go from 40+ hours a week to 16. Some great coworkers others not so much. You can easily get laid off as easily as you get hired.
good,"•	Professionally handles a high volume of complex inbound calls"
good,"This job is very fast pace especially during welcome season. Customer service is very demanding and it takes a special kind of person to work in this field. CVS Health is a great company and they really work with you if you ever need anything. Management is great they treat you like family at my site. My co-workers were great as, well the people that i have met. The center i worked in have very kind people. I now work from home and that is  one of the opportunities CVS Health offers. There are some hardships that come with this job such as the call volume it gets very busy and there are a lot of hard problems to solve but that is what customer service is  all about. But what I enjoy the most is working from home, it's a great opportunity."
good,"Coram was great company to start with. If you are looking for fast money and long-term career with employment, Coram is Ideal; however if you are looking to make career with advancements, Coram is not the company for you."
good,This is a good company to work for when you are a student. For three years I've been handing my bosses a new school schedule that they've worked well with every time. The amount of hours you receive are based on your availability.
good,"Fair wages, save work environment. However due to restructure and elimination of jobs created more job functions for the few still needed to perform those functions. Thus creating more stress and more errors to meet a growing need. Motto is chase excellence and catch perfection. I agree with that. I Have learned many things and improving processes is my goal. My first goal is to provide a service and processing narcotic orders and get them out the door. Data entry, managing time, quantity and quality. Maintain the Core values of Compassion, Integrity, Service, and Excellence.  Its important to acknowledge staff and encourage their dedicated service. They make the team successful. Team work is how to get the job down. The hardest part is a company that downsizes and eliminated position to create just one making it very stressful and affecting the quality, quantity, and happiness of the employee."
good,CVS Caremark is a good company for employees to further customer service experience. Training for position is required and provided for the most part.
good,I worked for this company for almost 3 years and it took that long to understand that there was a low ceiling in this environment and that it was a job and not a career.
good,"Your schedule changes each week and you are supposed to be given it two weeks in advance. Most managers are willing to work around all scheduling needs (some exclusions such as holidays). There is usually no more than two people on the sales floor at one time, depending on the store volume, including yourself. At any given time you could have a customer requiring your help on the sales floor, a line forming at the front counter, a call for change in the pharmacy (which is separate from the retail portion of the store), and have a customer or fellow employee calling on the phone line for various reasons. It is important to have the ability to multitask, prioritize, and keep a calm demeanor as needed while still keeping the high standards of customer service that Corporate demands. "
good,Management was awful. Co-workers were not pleasant. Only good thing about CVS was that they paid more than my current job at Walgreens.
good,"A typical work day would consist of Doctors orders on prescriptions drugs, billing health insurances, filling presciptions, customer services, managing work task duties such as; ordering out of stock inventory, keeping track of expired medications,filing prescriptions records, data entry, and much more."
good,Not conducive to sales staff. I would research any company before working for it.  CVS acquired the infusion business and do not know how to manage it.
good,Good entry level jobs for people starting off in their career.  Heavy emphasis on entry - the jobs here are not for everyone as they are stressful at times.
good,"happy client, multiple jobs to accomplish counting, filling prescriptions, putting away stock, filing, ordering. i really enjoyed my work and i wanted to make this a career"
good,CVS runs a skeleton crew 24/7. They never have enough workers to efficiently help customers or take breaks. They also don't offer benefits to part time employees.
good,"The work is very physical however it is not too difficult. The coworkers are all friendly and willing to give you advice if needed. The benefits for full-time employees are good: 401k, stock options, paid time off, sick leave, etc. Most supervisors are able to accommodate your schedule for work-life balance."
good,Its an okay place to work a typical day can be from 8hrs to 12 hrs depending on the volume. Management varies and most of them are former workers themselves.
good,"I learned a lot in my tenure with CVS Pharmacy but after gaining the skills and completing my degree, I do not feel CVS leaves me with many advancement opportunities. I learned a lot about management skills and keeping employees on task and in compliance with all the all the different monthly and yearly requirements of a pharmacy technician. I was also tasked with developing a weekly schedule for all of the employees, myself included and notifying those employees of their weekly schedules because many of the employees worked on a bi-weekly or once a month in order to remain on CVS payroll. The most difficult part of this job in my opinion would have to be customer service because you deal with such a wide variety of individuals in a pharmacy, many of whom are sick and not at their best, so at times tension can rise high if things are not completed promptly. This was one of the main things I was assigned to work with was the customer service in the store and dealing with customer complaints. I feel over the course of my time with CVS that I learned many viable skills in customer relations."
good,Fast paced job with good benefits. Flexible with scheduling good team work friendly environment caring people good opportunity to grow with the company
good,Work life balance was great.  We were in a growing pain mode so it was tough to do this you know what I mean. So not really sure what else to say
good,"cvs pharmacy was a great place to work, if you like direct patient contact. the biggest let down is that their is little to no room to grow or advance within the company"
good,"Fun staff, decent hours, understaffed. I don't understand how a company who makes most of its money from the pharmacy has most of their pharmacies understaffed."
good,At cvs we are a pretty busy store so must days I'm at the cash register helping customers or typing in prescriptions in the computer. I love my co-workers we all work very well as a team and they make everything easier. The hardest part is that we don't always have the hours to sufficient help to get all the work done which causes us the get very behind in filling and typing prescriptions which then causes our customer service scores to go down.
good,"Love the research and work we did to benefit the clients membership, learned a lot about the Medicare program. However the corporate CVS office is slowly moving all job processes to contracted companies therefore closing various local Med D departments."
good,Good company with many opportunities for advancement. Coworkers and management are supportive. The best part of the job is the opportunity to partner with clients to deliver the best possible solutions and improve overall patients outcomes.
good,"Great pay, long hours. Kind of excessive. Overall a good job but I was very unhappy.Money was nice. twenty words twenty words twenty words"
good,"I love the whole aspect of my job as a pharmacist. I love helping the patients and working with the physician's to make sure they are on the best therapy medically and financially. I also enjoy counseling them and researching those oddball difficult questions patients throw at me. On the contrary, I do not feel the priorities of the company are headed in the right direction other than banning smoking products. I want to take time with my patients and help improve their QOL; however, all the paperwork that's expected takes SO much time away from satisfying my patients' needs. Each day that passes I hope corporate will finally realize this and start to make some positive changes."
good,Fast paced mail order pharmacy. Good management and team.  Job is very repetitive and requires you to be on your feet during the whole shift.
good,I worked at a contact call center for advance pcs/ caremark. Advance pcs was a pharmaceutical call center. My responsibilities consist of taking a high volume of incoming calls. Customers would call in with questions about the prescription drugs wether or not they had rx refills left and if they qualified for mail order rx refills.
good,You need to take time to invest in your team in order to get great results. Sometimes that takes months...sometimes years. The work is drudging itself...but having a great team behind you makes the difference.
good,Assisting with proactives to get them faxed out to the medical doctor's offices and then enter prescription into the systems to be approved by a registered pharmacist. Then proceed with checking in with benefits verification team to see if the clients' insurance is approved or not.
good,"A typical day includes juggling multiple tasks at once. As a pharmacy technician, you are required to greet customers, locate and provide them with their filled prescriptions, as well as fill those prescriptions. To fill a prescription, one must first locate the drug's bottle, scan it into the system to verify it, pour and count the required amount, label the new bottle, and pass it onto the pharmacist for verification. At times when a conflict arises with the doctor or insurance company, you are required to call and find a solution. You are constantly on your feet and moving, which is beneficial as time goes by quickly. It can be challenging at times to balance filling scripts with providing customer service, but in the end it is rewarding."
good,"A day in the life: Processing, preparation, and production of prescriptions. Overall cleanliness maintenance. Adjudication of insurance claims and resolution of denials. Filing of prescription hardcopies according to state and federal regulations (HIPAA). Ensuring drugs are in keeping with good manufacturing practice, and have not passed expiration dates before being dispensed."
good,There are very few company's nowadays where you have the opportunity to continue to grow until retirement age. Being a force in the PBM industry you can definitely count on job security with this company.
good,"I come in log into my computer, see what needs to be done as far as processing claims or faxing out audits. I have learned a lot about the PBM business as well as Audits and Pharmacies. Some co-workers are warming and welcoming. But it is mostly like a high school environment with all the clicks and gossip. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry pharmacies and trying to explain the guidelines to them and that you are in fact trying to help them.Most enjoyable is when things run smoothly and no complaints from pharmacies."
good,The overall job atmosphere is really o.k. the management is really great to work with and will work with you to achieve your goals. Hours are flexible
good,"retail customer service. direct focus are the customers . keeping the store well maintained and stock level low, and shrink levels down"
good,"A typical day at work at CVS involves running a cash register the majority of the time and helping people find certain products. You put up a lot of sale signs and take them down every week. The job is tedious many times. You learn to deal with people who use a lot coupons and this teaches you a lot of patience. There are typically two or three other crew members and depending on how busy your store is, it can be hard to get to everyone is a timely manner. Co-workers are generally nice and you get to know them well. The hardest part of the job is trying to put of signs and complete transactions at the same time. This is very frustrating sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the time you get to spend with your coworkers."
good,"Company is making great strides in promoting health and wellness.  The adage people don't leave a company, they leave people is applicable to this company.  They promote pharmacists to DM's and they have no retail or management experience and cause real headaches for the true retail managers trying to make a go of it in this company."
good,"Overall the days were long and there was usually a lot of work to be done. There was always something to be done, definitely never a dull day."
good,When i worked for CVS the management wasnt so good. The reason i say that is because nothing was ever done correctly in that store. All the managers did was sit in the break room most of the day unless it was a problem on the floor
good,"A typical day at the pharmacy involves interacting with patients, insurances and doctors. There are plenty of new experiences and ways to learn to be found every single day working here. There is never a dull moment in the pharmacy, and there is always more work that can be done. Constantly trying to meet deadlines (several every hour) can be a cause of stress among colleagues, but keeps things in order and makes the day pass faster. "
good,Lots of people tend to come at the same time so the register is always busy and around 400 to 500 scripts being filled at my store a day too.
good,"High Volume Environment"
good,No support from DM. Felt like all alone on an island.  Only feedback was negative.  Company rollouts were not well communicated.  Technology was WAY behind the times.
good,This was a very structured workplace with little room for creativity.  I enjoyed counseling patients and solving problems.  The company kept cutting technician staff which made the job harder.  Technicians were thrown into workplace without much training.  Pharmacists had to work very long hours with no breaks.  Management made all decisions and really did not listen to employee input.
good,"filled prescriptions, data entered prescriptions, answered 10-line phone system, assisted customers with whatever was needed"
good,"Some Supervisors there do not like helping you at all.When I was in training,Supervisor I had was on her phone texting while I had my hand raised up for 5mins.When she got to me,she didn't clearly answer my question.She said she will just send the information and steps by email later on.I didn't receive it,later the next day.Thats when I ran into the question with a patient.I got my supervisor to help me,instead of showing me the steps.She did it on her own to help the patient.After work,I received the news the I was laid off.That supervisor does not demonstrate good traits of a leader."
good,"I've worked in quite a few CVS's and in each one, New management with no idea of what they are doing, with too much to prove. Many managers that do nothing and expect alot. Became too stressful for me."
good,"While interning at CVS, I was able to see how a typical pharmacy technician would work. The first month was very educational and helpful but as time went on, the technicians and pharmacists had no more use for me and I eventually became the ""go get this"" girl."
good,"Very easy work, dealing with management is horrible! Customers would harass me and the store manager would do nothing. I felt very unsafe.  The harassment was so bad i now suffer from depression."
good,"Lead a team of eight members to provide prescrition solutions, assessed client need in atimely manner provided mutual solutions to satisfaction"
good,"A typical day at CVS is fast paced and full of rewarding challenges.  After a long day of work, I really do feel accomplished.  I've learned everything I know because of my Pharmacy Manager.  I believe she's help me be the Pharmacy Technician I am today.  I'm confident with working in the Pharmacy and I've become a great problem solver.  The hardest part of the job is the hour cuts.  Our hours were cut more than ever and it's the busiest time of the year."
good,i did my externship there it was a fun place to work it was small people got along good it was very enjoyable staff very nice to work with the store i work for was fast pace like it
good,"with minimal staff they expect you to kill yourself for low pay, break down multiple pallets alone and when an injury happens they get mad and argue if it really happened at cvs.  training is horrible, got trained by everyone besides the manager and then manager gets mad at you for doing things different or wrong"
good,Working at CVS Caremark was a great experience for me. I developed new skills and experiences in many different ways. Management is great and my co-workers were very team oriented
good,Omnicare offers good benefits and great vacation and sick time. There down fall is letting the wrong people make decisions. They advance based on who you know and not the work you do. If your not good friends with the right people then your going nowhere.
good,"A typical day at CVS Pharmacy would be, clocking on one of the registers and then helping the line of people. Once you caught a break then you are able to put on a your smock, and then, for me I would just print labels, pull drugs, fill prescriptions, and put drugs away. I would be answering the phones that rang non stop, and also help with the line of people, either at the drive-thru or in store. I have learned how to be very productive at doing multiple tasks at the same time. For an example, I would be on the phone helping someone, while at the same time I would be counting pills. This job keeps you on your toes all day long. Very"
good,"Convenient and not a bad place to work  Been here for nearly 3 years and yet, hours are being cut-but the Company STILL plans to open up more stores!"
good,"A typical day would include answering phones, filling prescriptions, and assisting customers. I learned a lot about different medications, health conditions, and a more in depth look at how these diseases can effect people. I work with a great team that encourages team work and always keep things interesting! It can be difficult from time to time trying to multitask 5 or 6 things at a time but the relationships you form with the patients are worth it!"
good,"Day at work depends on how busy the store is. Usually it's busy when we received a lot of boxes, have a handful of photo orders to process and customer service returns and exchanges. I would say everyday I learn something new just by encountering with different people. Learning is a continuous process which I prefer to be able to be better. The on-going change in our management keeps us more busy when they change things in the store and want things in different way. My co-workers are trustworthy and friendly, that's the other reason why I stay in this job. They are reliable and helpful with professional level. I would say the hardest part of my job is when there's too much work that needs to be done in a way where there's no enough coverage. Usually the store have enough cashier and clerk to ring and help customers but now as a team we have to help them and sometimes we can't finish our boxes that needs to be put away. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know I finished all the work that needs to be done, accomplishing the photo orders on time and assisted customers on what they needed in the store, helped them with what they're looking for."
good,"great co-workers, safe environment"
good,understaffed and overworked only care about making money not the customers or employees
good,I loved the people that I work with. great work flow concept but they would not hire enough people to have enough staff to fill in a timely manner. We had to wait till all the work was done so we would be scheduled till 12am but be there till 230am.
good,"I enjoyed my time at CVS Health, while I was there.  I did my job well despite the challenges.  I made good friendships.  I learned a lot in my time there and I learned that I had a lot to teach others as well."
good,"A typical day at work were always busy, and physically demanding. Perfected English, customer service, to manage inventory, to manage pharmacy tasks. Management was very flexible, but needed to learn how to handle pharmacy better. The hardest part of the job, was to manage pharmacy tasks with little help, as well physical demand in high volume environment. The most enjoyable part to learn how to manage all tasks in pharmacy typing, inventory, customer service, flow of the pharmacy, and personal gratification from customers."
good,"I enjoyed this job, however due to the lack of pay and opportunity I left my position as pharmacy tech. My coworkers are friendly, the salary is horrible. Must be able to multitask well."
good,Good place to work with low compensation and not enough advancement opportunities.
good,"In the pharmacy you're busy from the time you get to work in the morning until you leave. It use to be a pretty fun place to work even though it was lacking in pay; however, now the company seems to be more concerned with doing things to inconvenient the customer. They also like to give away gift cards if employees don't ask customers certain questions and the customer catches then the employee gets in trouble and written up."
good,"Responsible for providing concise patient and prescription information in accordance with HIPAA requirements via various sources. The position maintains and supports the integrity of the Prescription Records to ensure HIPAA compliance when providing Protected Health Information. Also supports Compliance and Persistency Programs"
good,"CVS Is a good company but shift bids aren't good when they don't take in to consideration that people do have children and can't work any time requested. They say job performance and call stats are accounted for in the final choices but they aren't it's a set up for a set back. The job it self is awesome, love the work....but the hours are horrible."
good,"As a CVS store manager a typical day consist of taking care of the front store and pharmacy customers, then the staff would start to completing the daily operations of the store, whether unloading/stocking warehouse shipments, re-merchandising regular/seasonal sections, changing out prices, processing vendor invoices."
good,"By too much customer service, what I mean is some customers felt as if they were ""shoving cvs down their throats""...constant phone calls, 5 minute intro when answering the phones, cvs cards, and surveys..."
good,The employees were great. Some of the management team wasn't so great.  The last one I had before I left kept changing the procedures of my job I kept getting confused.
good,"Everyday was a different day at the pharmacy. You were always on your toes. There was always something to do. You were challenged every day at work which was a great thing. It was never boring. We were a big family at the pharmacy. We weren't just ""co-workers."" We all got along just great."
good,Alot of younger first time workers and the laid back atmosphere almost overules the level of professionalism amongst co workers.. However a solid manag
good,"A lot of the pharmacy work is mental work and requires an employee to demonstrate responsibility and time management skills. I've learned how to effectively work on a team, communicate to co-workers and customers, and manage daily tasks. I have the best co-workers. I could not have worked in a better pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is the fact that it can be stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with people from different areas since our store is so close to a college town."
good,"This company would be great, but there is a disconnect between the District Management and the store management.  They are open 24 hours with no contingency plans for adverse weather conditions.  I was totally mislead by joining this organization as a store manager trainee.  They didn't have enough training hours to get me trained which led to a slower transition to a store manager position.  Five months and still had not been trained on payroll.  Need a more educated store management force.  Employees really deserve to at least have a break after working at least four hours, not seven."
good,Working with my co-workers I have no problem with. It's the environment and the people I interact with.
good,I enjoyed the work environment and staff. We had a great working relationship in spite of the disconnect with the district manager who was later reassigned.
good,"work over 40 per week with one day off and have to fight for a 3 day ""vacation"""
good,I have learned a lot about medications as well as interactions between medications and allergies.  Entering in orders all day to maintain and exceed daily productivity standards set forth for the department.  I work very well with my co-workers helping them out with issues and fixing problems that may arise.  Majority of my co-workers will come to me to solve a problem or look into an issue to ensure quality and thouroughness.
good,"I loved working there, it was my first job. The problem was I did majority of.the.work. There was no help from my coworkers. I stayed busy so time went by quick."
good,"The store is pretty busy, but the working hours are limited each week. This creates work overload and crazy evening."
good,"A typical day at CVS is, you clock in, be the cashier, but also have to do a range of tasks from stocking to passport photos. I've discovered how difficult working retail is, but I've learned how to be much more patient and how to be able to work with the public. Management has changed a few times. My current Manager tries to work with me as best as she can but obstacles such as a low limit on hours have created a challenge. We try to work around these obstacles as best we can. My co-workers are great. I look forward to coming into work to interact with them. The most difficult part of the job is that it's retail which means I have to deal with everything that comes in working retail. I am at the mercy of the public and have to be able to take verbal abuse without retaliating. My co-workers make up for that in their ability to get me to laugh."
good,"Managing 5-6 technicians throughout the day while verifying 350+ rxs/day.  Great staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the patients and leading them to better health.  The hardest part of the job is being too busy at times to grow the business, which I desire to do."
good,"The pharmacy is always busy, but that makes the day go by faster.  I have learned alot there in the last 2 months and have alot more to learn.  "
good,I come into work pull up all programs and make calls on account that are 30 days past due and get insurance information if we have none on file. I also explain medicare D and Medicaid programs from various states to the customers and make sure all billing has been done on the account
good,"Working here is great because of my interaction with customers; however, management is not all that great."
good,A typical day at CVS Caremark was fly by the seat of your pants.  No direction from supervisor.  I lerned how to be self movative and get as must work done as I could on a daily basis.  Management was ok if she needed something from you otherwise no where to be found.  Some of my co-workers where very helpful but the ones I needed help from were not.  Hardest part of the job was learning things on my own with no direction.  The Customers is what I loved about the job most.
good,"Typical day at CVS started out right away. I just had to dive in because I scheduled myself to work at the busy time when most of the work needed to get done. Retail pharmacy was challenging especially since that is where most people go to fill there prescriptions due to insurances requiring people to go there to get the lowest possible copay. "
good,"It's very demanding, and never being able to plan or know what my schedule was did not work."
good,"CVS at the corporate level is very detached and uncaring about their personnel.  They do not adequately or competitively compensate their pharmacy technicians, nor do they seem to do so for similar front store positions that do the majority of customer service interactions.  This is compounded with extremely high stress levels since you will likely be overworked due to not having enough help.  As a result, their turnover rate for employees is very high.  The only saving grace for the company is its culture, and the employees you will work with on a daily basis."
good,stressful and understaffed constantly.  learned about retail pharmacy workflow.  hardest part was dealing with all the constant stress and insurance processing issues.  most enjoyable was talking with the pharmacist and learning about counseling patients
good,"Each day was pretty much the same as a cashier. People came in you bring them to the aisle, ring their goods, and possibly return any items that customers didn't want. After the day is over employees faced the items in aisles, manager gives a bag check and then everyone goes home. I learned and experienced some time in retail. How to price items, complete truck orders, and put up sale items. Management was alright definitely could have been better by backing up the employees more often. My co-workers were young and got the job done. The hardest part of the job was truck night and placing items on the shelves for purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers on the floor."
good,"A typical day at work was answering the phones and assisting pharmacies and people with issues with the prescription benefits issues"
good,I have always maintained high standards of my work and those who work with me and have exercise good judgement and decision making skills
good,"Ive learned alot from working at cvs caremark. I loved working with my  coworkers. CVS caremark is a great place to work, i enjoyed my job and even other job functions there. They allowed me to learn whatever i wanted to learn."
good,"It was a fun job but not a safe environment. When I worked, it was just my manager and I and of course the 3-4 pharmacist (way in the back), but my manager would either be in the back restock room or in the office. So when I was slapped by a customer (I caught her stealing) I had to phone for my manager over the intercom, asking for help. There really needs to be two or more cashiers up front at ALL times. If I was seriously injured, I probably wouldn't have been found for a long time. Again, its a fun place to work but it very unsafe for one person to have to watch other the front by herself."
good,I learned to further develope my Communication and Leadership Skills
good,Typical day included many upset customers and management who seemed to not care about their needs.
good,CVS ia a leader in retail pharmacy. The best part was the interaction with the customers.
good,"My first job while in college, working at CVS was a great place for me to learn about the medical field, but there were not as many opportunities for me to advance as I had hoped. I had worked there for 3 years, and never had the opportunity to be promoted, nor did any of my co-workers earn a new position while I was there. As a result, this affected their company moral. Although I learned a great deal of pharmaceutical knowledge, I remained a cashier, and was never able to put my skills into practice. The hardest part of my job was balancing the retail of store items with the distribution of prescriptions to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting guests with special needs."
good,"Love the team I work with, everyone gets along and has a team spirit. Senior leaders are all welcoming and for the most part, want to help in your growth and development"
good,"Ok company to work for...Wasn't a very fun atmosphere though and you get little recognition for the hard work you put in. In the end, I just wasn't happy with sitting at a desk all day doing order entry."
good,"A typical work day is pretty steady. All employees are aware of their tasks and we all jump in where needed. I have learned conflict resolution, multi tasking, and how to remain organized in high paced environments. My co-workers are very knowledgeable of their job, so it makes the work flow easier at times. This company micromanages and forces us to do unnecessary tasks in unreasonable time frames. Raises are very small, and their not on time."
good,"life experience, multi-tasking, fast pace, team work, problem solving and trouble-shooting"
good,"CVS is a well organized, stable and hands-on place to work. A typical day at work is being upfront greeting guests, working the cash  register and helping any customers that need assistance."
good,There is alot of employee turnover which makes it harder to schedule and constantly training new employees is tiresome. The pay is low and not near the national average for certified techs.  I do enjoy working with the current staff and of course i like being employed
good,My typical day at work was very peaceful. I learned that customers come first. My co-workers and management team was awesome to work for.There really wasn't anything hard about his job. The most enjoyable thing about this job is customer satisfaction.
good,"A typical day at CVS included coming in and working the register, or drop off or production. You never knew what to expect with the customers when they came in or called. Had to verify everybody's story with their profile, and/or doctor."
good,"Friendly coworkers, a little unorganized and just"
good,"CVS  Caremark as a whole is a wonderful company to work for.  But working under the direct leadership of this particular immediate supervisor is challenging. In my opinion, he does not exemplify the goals or missions that CVS Caremark is boldly attempting to achieve. He tend to be extremely petty, superficial and disrespectful. With the right leaders overlooking the day-to-operations at the store the level, CVS Caremark could be an extraordinary pharmaceutical corporation in the very near future but as long as they have camouflaged hypocritical bigots working for them, CVS Caremark is going to have a long way to go and a hard time getting there. It is a certainty he isn't the only one who is working under their umbrella."
good,"This job is very fast paced and customer oriented. A typical day includes entering patient information, filling prescriptions, stocking and checking inventory, and checking out patients."
good,I leaned all the necessary things I need to know to perform my job
good,CVS/Pharmacy is a good company to work for if you are just starting out in a pharmacy technician.
good,"Although it is a medical field, CVS is definitely a retail job, sometimes it can be rewarding when you are able to help someone during a time of sickness but you also have to deal with people yelling at you on a fairly regular basis."
good,Working in the pharmacy there is no breaks.  Had to eat and work. Not enough workers for one shift.
good,"Answering member calls, but was not told dept was under sanction my Medicare."
good,"A Typical work day was filling of prescriptions, Order and restocking product etc. I learned a lot at Omnicare about filling and working in an inpatient pharmacy. My Immediate Supervisor was moody to say the least and very difficult to work for everyday. My Co-Workers were very good at what they did and great to work with but, they were always uneasy and on guard working with such a supervisor making the workplace sometimes very hard to be in. The hardest part of the job was finding ways to get around the supervisor to get your work done. The best part of the job was knowing that you are helping people who can not help them selves and getting out of there alive everyday in one piece."
good,"Unfortunately, my entire history with CVS has ended on a somewhat somber and sad note.  Although I enjoyed much success with CVS and worked in several different positions allowing me the opportunity to learn many aspects of the company including being sent to Hawai'i for three months for employee training, the end eventually came due to the mentality that exists among big Corporate America.  At store level things are the most challenging of all; working without breaks, working at intense speeds and doing so year after year with increased budget cuts, yes each and every year.  The expectations became grossly out of scale to the compensation."
good,I work in the IV Department as a Pharmacy Technicain. I work under the supervision of 3 fantastic pharmacists.
good,"Daily I assisted customers with questions and filling/refilling of prescriptions, ordering stock and helping the Pharmacist with whatever they needed."
good,They worked us like robots. Some  nights we would be there until 2:00 a.m. filling orders. We did not have enough employees to do all the orders that we had for all the nursing homes patients.
good,"a typical day includes typing in prescriptions, counting pills, and helping customers. I have learned to deal with people efficiently and politely. management at the store level is fine, my co-workers are good people although several are new so they are still learning. the hardest part of the job is when we get lots of customers in at the same time, making it hard to help everyone in a timely manner. the most enjoyable part of the job is when i correctly remember a customers name before they have to tell me."
good,"The pharmacy is a very fast pace, busy, diverse work environment. Customer service skills are a must."
good,shipping and receiving merchandise in charged of counting numbers of merchandise received. very friendly place to work
good,"customer service, calls for refills for a mail order pharmacy"
good,A lot of on the job training was required. Though I learned a lot about medical insurance and specific medicines. The management was difficult to work with as I was learning as I worked. My co-workers were very helpful and reliable if I needed help. The learning curve was difficult but also enjoyable. I gained a lot of knowledge at the same time I gained experience.
good,"CVS/Pharmacy is cool, but sometimes a little too laid back. I am trying to advance to a better job, but if u want a laid back job that can be a little frustrating at times this is the job for you."
good,"good work enviroment, boss allows for family first if need to take off early or day off due to illness. "
good,Its a good place to work. The work load isn't too stressful and you can still manage your personal life with your professional life.
good,"Por ser uma empresa de prestação de serviço e por atuar nos ramos da citricultura e sucroalcooleira, tem que se enquadrar nas regras das contratantes e os funcionários não entendem, e era onde eu entrava conscientizando quanto a importância de seguir as normas. O bom era que no final as contratantes vinha elogiar o trabalho desenvolvido e feito."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy would be doing multiple activities at once: waiting on customers, answering phones, filling prescriptions, entering information on patients and rx's, inventory control. I learned  how a pharmacy runs and about medications and their uses. The management in the pharmacy is great. CVS management however could use improvement. We are underpaid and often understaffed. Most of my co-workers are highly intelligent and great to work with. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the drug uses and generic names. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is production where you fill the prescriptions and interacting with customers."
good,"At first I really liked working here, it was my first full time job as a certified pharmacy technician, and the money was pretty decent.I must say however, after hearing other co-workers talk, I realized that we were actually being over worked and under paid.I soon learned that you were expected to work until the last run was out (which we were scheduled until 8pm) and there were many times in which I worked these evenings and didn't get out until 11pm.Also, the Lead Technician for the department was horrible.I always tried to work above and beyond expectations,and I must say I learned how to do inventory in no time at all.Our Lead Tech, however, did not know how to do this and had been in the position of Lead over 10 years. The Scheduling was always a nightmare,and half the time our department head would forget what you were schedule to work because she would change it so many times."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of inventory of all items in the pharmacy. It is a fast paced job. I learned how to read a prescription how to enter it in the computer, and count the medicine. I learned about the medications what they are used for."
good,the women that work there are very catty.  If you werenr part of the click then you got nothing in the form of recognition
good,Can't say much for this employer. They give you a helf decent amount of money to do a job. that's about it.
good,"-fill anywhere from 500-750rx per day in an 24 hour."
good,"Good company to work for. I worked with a great team who supported each other through everything. However, the company did lack Work-Life balance. "
good,"In a typical day at work I stock, work a cash draw and assist customers on the sales floor. I've learned several things while working there that i didn't have access to learning at my previous jobs. Management at my location could and probably should be better. Some of my co-workers are a joy to work with while others aren't really team players. The hardest part of my job is that i feel i am way more excited and motivated to work than some of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is that i get to deal with people face to face. I get to help them if they have issues and i connect with them on a higher level than them just being a customer."
good,"The help desk is a well-paying position, but the group is severely lacking in morale and direction."
good,"Typical pharmacy work environment.  Learned a lot about customer service, organization, and teamwork. Co-workers was a delight. Hardest part was exceeding goals. The most enjoyable was working for a company that doubled in growth."
good,It could be worse. I guess it would depend on the area in which you work.
good,"Depends on the site. Direct management is great, while regional managers dictate what they can do."
good,"While the services provided by Omnicare are important to the provision of care for long term care patients nationwide the company has suffered from a lack of focus on employee culture, a failure to provide advancement opportunities or develop employee skills and abilities. The work is challenging and there is a lack of understanding between those performing the work and their mangers and employees are generally considered replaceable regardless of their value."
good,* Stress induce environment
good,Had a great opportunity to have the freedom to set displays draw in customers and inform them on skin care.
good,"The customers are the ones who make the work place very great. We have alot of customers coming to our location, more cashiers are in need for our locations."
good,The company had a great benefit plan. I learned how to reset password and create users for the terminals. I also learned to troubleshoot the printers and copiers. I also had to replace telephones and wires. I had to provide customer service to the other employees. The others I worked with were all team players and looked out for one another. The most enjoyable part of the job was to make others happy after troubleshooting their computer or terminal.
good,very demanding company that is changeing and dont take care of there employees
good,i didnt like working here because they took away hours mad do more work in less time
good,"There was so much to do in so little time. No necessary materials for the job, slight chance for advancement."
good,i ran the register and cooked and unloaded stock off the truck.
good,"As a subsidiary of CVS, there was far more emphasis on retail business as opposed to pharmacy/patient care. My co-workers were nice people, although I know they were not thrilled with working there.We all had the feeling of being a statistic as opposed to being a person. The hardest part of the job was the pressure to meet quotas, which increased steadily, even though the personnel remained constant, sometimes being reduced. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with patients. Note I use the word 'patients' instead of 'customers'."
good,"A typical day at work for CVS caremark was very fast paced, the phone calls were back to back so i typically answered between 80-150 calls daily. Ive learned alot about medicare part D which is medication coverage. the hardest part about my job was seeing alot of people leave that I had gotten close with."
good,"A typical day at work includes verifying presciptions, counseling patients, consulting and advising other healthcare professionals, making OTC recommendations and triaging patients with questions, insurance adjudication and prior authorizations, scheduling, technician training, compounding of prescriptions, and many more activities/duties."
good,"Very good standards, good customer service, and a fun product to serve. Much like other fast food concepts, except the food was different and the way it was handled was different."
good,this hospital having good environment but the giving me less salary as i deserve thats why i want to leave this job
good,"My job is very fast paced and busy which I enjoy. I also enjoy working with customers and my co-workers. A typical day at CVS is putting prescriptions in the computer, answering phones, filling prescriptions, waiting on customers and insurance billing."
good,"While working for Omnicare, I have found that it is great for building group communication skills. The pharmacy is broken down into several departments, and the communication between each department is vital to the company's success."
good,This is a very fast paced environment with alot of responsibility. I learned about insurance from the inside. Management was instable in that they changed management quickly. Coworkers were nice and friendly.
good,We use 7 different systems that could be brought down to Two systems. We have different passwords for all those systems. The system we use for information is hard to work. You can never find what you are looking for. The supervisor there offer very little help. When they do offer help it is the wrong information and it leaves the customer on hold to get the right infomation. The ost enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. I have learned how to enbrace my skills and to do things on my own without help from others.
good,It's a very busy .There is a lot you can learn from the company because they have a lot of different department.There is always overtime available.
good,flexible schedule... start off pay is not that great. no benefits for part time employees. no room to advance.
good,"i enjoy working especially my co-workers, the most enjoyable part of my job is providing good customer service especially when they have problem with insurance paying for their medication. you go an extra miles calling insurance and doctor to get the medication ready for the patient. after they patient will go home with their medication happy."
good,"Be aware of ""nit-picking"" managers that try to manage by fear. Company merged four years ago and there still remains a power struggle."
good,"I've had the pleasure of working at Caremark for Six years. It's been good overall, but not really what i believe to make as a life long career. co-workers really make it an enjoyable place to work."
good,"when i get to work i start in production and fill prescriptions and either wait on customer at pick window from drive thru and at counter, i will go to drop off and type in all new prescriptions from customer, doctors, faxes, and at anytime during the day i make calls to customers or doctors or insurance companies to solve any problems that may arise."
good,"All about customer serivice but I have met some of my closets friends from here. You have tons of interacton with customers, some are difficult and some are very grateful."
good,not enough staffing at times at 2 out of 3 locations that I worked.
good,"Worked autonomously and had varied duties from collecting on revenue billed to insurance companies (usually high dollar claims) and patients, organizing patient files, requesting and verifying appropriate documentation, authorizations, contract pricing and billing completed. Proudest moments were my ability to jump into the job with very minimal training and collect on long-time outstanding claims. Most notable that I achieved was a claim for a patient that I collected from an insurance company totalling over $500,000. Unfortunately, Coram was in a Bankruptcy when I was hired on and they did not come out of it at the expected time. Large percentage of workforce laid-off and location later closed."
good,"Working at a retail pharmacy is usually quite demanding in general, and CVS was no exception. This is a very high stress environment, and the workload is usually intense. The good news is that if can handle it, you can aquire or improve upon some very useful skills working there. Examples would be better multitasking, providing good customer service to individuals under a high stress load. Attention to detail is absolutely critical, regardless of how you happen to be feeling that day, and it helped improve mine tremendously."
good,"Difficult position and extremely stressful, but I absorbed a lot of information and education on pharmaceutical companies, medications, and built great relationships with patients."
good,Typical work day : Monday thru friday 5am to 3 pm Mandatory.
good,"Assisted with customer service, stocking merchandise, and operating cash register. Built promotions displays for weekly sales and seasonal sales."
good,Great work experience. Something new to learn everyday. Long tiring night hours.
good,"A typical day at work, walk in and get attacked by customers. All day is gimme gimme gimme. There are a few thank yous but mostly its give the customers what they want no matter how unreasonable.I learned how to read perscriptions and to type directins using the sig codes quickly. I learned how to get things done in a timely manner. My main pharmacist doesn't always appreciate what i do but others do so that is nice.The hardest part of my job is that my co workers sometimes think they know how to do my job better than I do.The best part of my job are the rare thank yous"
good,"Fast paced days, there is always something new to learn, the management team is very helpful and knowledgeable, co-workers are available to assist when needed. The hardest part of my job is the difference between name brand and generic drugs. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new and using the learning tools to do my job better."
good,Poor staffing and hours allotted for workload. Not properly staffed to manage the amount of prescriptions filled each day.
good,"I did not enjoy working here. There were always people quitting, so you never really got to know your co-workers. It was also very clique-y. I started working there 3 months after the store opened and worked there for almost a year and never felt welcomed. My co-workers would go out together, but they would never invite the people that didn't start when the store opened."
good,Not a clear path for pharmacy technicians to move up in the company.
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a great company to work for, the only possible issue is what store you work at. Work usually goes by fast and is very exciting meeting customers and being able to help them out is the best part. Especially working in photo customers take their pictures very seriously."
good,Alot of change of management. Most employees became discouraged as all promotions were replaced by hires from outside the firm.108
good,Great in training in Medicare Part D. Consatant training on new information regarding the clients. Following HIPPA guidelines was a must.
good,Every morning we input the prescriptions into the system so labels can be printed and ready for other techs to fill medications. Constantly busy but can deal with pressure. Company was losing money and people were being laid off. I stayed only to finish school and then left to work for another company.
good,People around will keep you motivated.
good,"It is easy to upgrade your skills, but advancement opportunities are never offered to any employees and not discussed when asked of them. The system is incredible and easy. Its the best one I worked with."
good,"Must be able to multitask and able to answer inquiries, do a lot of customer service, and daily demands and routine of the job, both physical and technical aspects of the job."
good,It is a great place to initiate your work experience. Employees are considered in the various changes being made in the company.
good,Productive work place that offers a large amount of resources to learn from .
good,"this is a retail job, nevertheless your main action plan is cuustomer service"
good,"positive enviroment, great people"
good,"If your just starting out working its okay because the pay isn't all that great and with the way the economy is , you'll be lucky if it paid one bill."
good,It was fun working at CVS Caremark. I had enjoyed for the most part.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are looking for advancement however at times it does not have good management or work/life balance. CVS/Caremark is very big on their values, ethics etc. however there has been multiple instances that management does not show those values or ethics as an example for employees."
good,"overall good company to work for the only thing is, so many employees work there and they wouldn't rotate the weekends for everyone but other departments of the company does...it is very unfair that some employees get every weekend off and some like me don't get any."
good,"Working here will keep u busy at all times, there is always something to do which is good because it makes the time go by so fast. Work at a steady pace and make sure to greet the customers and always have a friendly attitude, even if they do not. Customer satisfaction is key in this business!"
good,Cvs is a Ok Place to work the pay was awful starting out with no chance of advancing
good,"Although continued efforts are to keep employees engaged and involved, Caremark suffers from departmental ""Silo's"" that inherently spawn pockets of non-cooperation. Unfortunatley this dilutes the continued efforts to maintain the culture of unity."
good,I liked working at the pharmacy. The hours worked great for a working mom and it was good to gain knowledge in understanding how a pharmacy works and also to gain drug knowledge.
good,"I liked working for CVS/Pharmacy as far as it being a good place to train and apply skills and knowledge as a technician.Honestly,I liked everything about CVS except for one thing: compensation is not balanced in relation to performance and responsibilities.In short,they do not pay very well."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace environment i did not like switching around as much because they required a timely manner for production and some people are just better at one thing than others so sometimes we would fall behind and get in trouble by the district for not meeting quota when it was store policy to rotate
good,"It is a nice job, but I feel that for everything they want done they need to give the stores more hours. There is a lot to be done and not enough time to do it, but it is a friendly atmosphere and customer orientated."
good,"* Be able to help out customers with their questions or concerns. "
good,There was points where I was working very little hours like 9 one week and the next was like 38. I needed more steady hours for being a mom to two toddlers. I never knew if I was working lots of hours or very little hours.
good,Every day is busy. Before more help now not enough help.It was a good company to work. But now it is hard to work. They expect more from employs with out giving more help. Besides   every store is different.Depending on the location the quality is different.
good,Deal with angry customers...holiday hours...nights and weekends...call offs...very stressful...a lot of turnover...not room to move up anywhere in company
good,"A typical day at this pharmacy was filling prescriptions, answering phones, and attending customers at the register. I learned you had to be  on top of your game in order to finish all assigned duties before the shift is over. Workplace culture is very stressful, at this time management was always watching our productivity and trying to get us to meet more than the expected target. The only issue with this is we were understaffed and could not complete tasks before the end of the shift. Discounts on all CVS products were the only exciting part of this job."
good,"stressful job, to much information to retain in a short period time and the management team is all for themselves, coworkers are friendly to many unanswered questions in regards to training not enough for the information"
good,"On a typical day, pharmacy techs collaborate with pharmacists to ensure customers receive quality care and meet all health and safety standards and protocols. Specificjob duties include sorting pills, creating labels, reviewing medication side effects, greeting customers, and ringing up purchases."
good,"Could be stressful at times; however, the job can be satisfying in helping patients getting their needs. Another good aspect of this job is it makes the best out of yourself in terms of work ethics."
good,I don't have anything to say about working here. It is hectic and you are always on your feet. This job was definitely not a long term for me because I knew I didn't want to be in the pharmaceutical realm.
good,The job was good the hours were not to bad the environment wasn't to bad they offered health benefits and offered a way to advance thru the company great benefits
good,"I love being a pharmacy tech, but the company has a lot of issues. I won’t go into all of them, but they do not treat their employees the way they should be treated"
good,"Extremely rewarding career path.  High volume and a strong attention to detail is required to be proficient in this field.  Addtionally, excellent communication skills."
good,"Not really a good job if you’re working part time, it’s a pretty easy job sometimes they put you to work in the pharmacy which is good to be cross trained."
good,I worked at CVS for almost 2 years and I really enjoyed working with others as a team. Unfortunately I had to resign from my position because I was not able to get enough hours.
good,I worked in the pharmacy.  It’s very fast paced.  Not a lot of room for advancement. The amount of work you do is a lot compared to the pay. You have to keep up with all your licenses but the company helps get you on a CE website.
good,"i was hired as an Accounts Receivable Specialist, my hiring class had about 30 people in it and when i left we had only a handful of people that stayed.  Management was constantly choosing favorites, pressing unrealistic expectations, and did not care about the happiness of the employees.  Finally, before i left i reported one of the managers who was exhibiting this bias behavior to the ethical line, whom eventually got fired.  The pay is fair and extremely good for Arizona, but the morale of the employees and management is extremely low leading to a hostile work environment that makes you not want to go to work even if the pay and benefits are great."
good,I worked there from 2011-2014 and it was a nice place to work when I was out of college an trying to find a job in my field that I have a degree in. It was ok.
good,The pharmacy is a sink or swim environment. There are never enough people working so you must be able to multitask and do everything while you are doing something else.
good,"Opportunity to explore all facets of retail business including team building, merchandising, human resource while promoting quality customer service.."
good,CVS is a glorified gas station convenience store with a pharmacy. Working there is not difficult but moneygram is stressful. Management was very inclusive.
good,Pharmarcist (lol idk how to spell it but you get it) are always nice and ready to help you grow. It was a good job overall with school and has better pay than most low wage jobs.
good,But when hired they do not tell you that you can't leave until it's called by area manager so you could work 8 hrs or 12 hr you never knew until you got to work
good,"CVS is a solid company. They are 100% customer oriented and posses great programs that help you in you day to day business. "
good,"The benefits are only for full timers. Great benefits thought which includes vision, dental , doctor visits and 401k match. I wish they included at least part of the benefits to part timers."
good,It was a very competitive job because we would get customer service ratings so everyone would be on their toes with giving there best smiles and service’s .
good,Aetna was acquired by CVS Health which brought a change in strategic direction and some upheaval to day-to-day activities.  The overall mission is good but the integration of the two companies is ongoing.
good,"it was very fun, different and at times chaotic."
good,"A typical day at work consists of dispensing medications, working at drop-off, counseling patients and checking out patients at the register. I learned a lot from my pharmacist and I was able to shadow my pharmacist when she was checking medications."
good,"CVS is a good job if you're in high school not looking to make much money. Very easy place to work, great company vision for all members of the family"
good,"Many opportunities to grow within the company. I only left due to becoming ill for an extended period of time, and the commute was also over 2 hours from my home."
good,"Good pay for social workers. Good benefits. Poor management. The company believes in ""you say jump, we say how high"" in regards to keeping their clients happy. Employee moral was low."
good,"Was a good place to work for. Worked"
good,"CVS was a good place to work,meeting new people everyday was nice and most of my co-workers were nice.The work was not hard and the money was pretty good for a manager."
good,Improvements need made for AR training specific. I enjoyed the people I worked with at CVS. The company is going through transition period. I would work for them again.
good,A typical day at CVS involves creating / updating the MS Project schedule with the team using WebX to share my screen so everyone accountable can see the plan as I share my desktop. We also review any outstanding risks & Issues and assign team members to own resolution to each one that is identified. The hardest part of the job is getting resources to complete their tasks on schedule as they are often assigned to other project tasks and they have too many number one priorities.
good,"I really enjoyed working at CVS, I haven't worked in the pharmacy in a while so it felt good to be doing what I love to do. Helping customers and learning different things everyday. This was my first time working in a retail pharmacy and it was cool."
good,working at CVS as a part time job is beneficial for those who are in college and need flexible working schedule. getting along with those who work with you and the pharmacist makes the job easier
good,"Staff pharmacist gossiped about all employees with other employees, she played loud horrible music and sang along as if she were in the shower. She refused to stop singing even after several customer complaints. Both pharmacists played favorites."
good,"typical work day involves answering inquirers about mail orders, placing and checking the status of mail orders along with any questions members have regarding their insurance coverage, I learned how to communicate with members from different parts of the world. The workplace culture was somewhat relaxed and fairly casual. The hardest part of the job is being expected to perform in other areas on demand without proper training and getting penalized for errors. The most enjoyable part was helping the members with their requests and concerns."
good,Be ready to work hard and fast and expect a lot of changes hiring people takes forever and store support is slow if you want answers ask your fellow managers it may be faster
good,"Typed new prescription in the computer, filled prescription, answered phones, sent faxes to doctor's office for prior authorization, updated customer insurance information along with address in the computer. I also ring up the purchased prescription and pull returns to stock prescriptions that have been in the waiting bin for over 2 weeks and reversed the charge to insurance."
good,"CVSHEALTH once cared about the patients, but it's about the numbers, now! There times I deal with parents and there infants needing medication for cancer, growth hormones and if the acct is not in New patient enrollment, then give the parent that information and move on to the next call. When I hear a parent cry for there child's medicine my heart break; tell me how can I ignore that parent. CVS concern is the number of calls taken that day.main"
good,I felt that I did a lot but didn't get paid enough. I really tried to do actual technician duties but I was mostly thrown to run the register and drive thru. I'm a team player and have excellent customer service skills. I work without being told what do. I'm bilingual in Spanish. I also would travel to other stores if they needed help.
good,"All technicians are friendly and the pharmacists are even better. My favorite crew is the night staff, they are full of energy. Everyone helps when needed and pull together to get a task done. The current manager is very understanding and works with your schedule to make sure everyone is happy. Weekends can get hectic, but the pharmacist make them fun. There are not designated break times, but they have to be asked for accordingly."
good,It was a good atmosphere. Can get stressful and a lot sometimes but in general it is a good place to work with some flexibility. It is a team oriented work place.
good,"very fast paced, you need to pick up skills quickly. many daily tasks for work flow as well as weekly tasks. need great costumer service skills and compassion."
good,"A place to grow and have a career, if you are a team player or team maker, this is a place to work,  if you enjoy in performing and doing your best and like helping customers, CVS is the place"
good,it's a good place for young college students who need a flexible schedule. Pay isn't enough to support oneself unless you are a manager of a store or higher.
good,"The most important thing is customer service & comfortable footwear. Be organized & friendly. Great dental and vision insurance, health not so much. Pay attention to the monthly LP Quiz."
good,The dept. I work with was had a very supportive supervisor & our team was one of the most productive.  We enjoyed working together and sharing our knowledge with each other. When CVS bought Coram the treatment of the employees dropped.  CVS had little or no respect for it's employees and that is why several of us left.
good,I had a big commute so my assessment is not as accurate. I worked alot of hours. Most of there pharmacies are very busy. Expect to work weekends regardless of your position ranking.
good,"This company has a fun environment and prizes diversity.  Staff oftentimes can be very supportive and resourceful."
good,As a student I needed a job that had flexible work hours. CVS worked with my school schedule and payed well for a college student. The only thing is the hours fluctuated. Sometimes they would cut hours randomly.
good,Closing the store will have you leaving an hour past the time the store closes (if you close with the wrong manager). Always something to do around the store: no standing around at the front. Fairly easy tasks. An 8 hour work day at CVS will be one of the longest 8 hours of your life.
good,"a frustrating place to work, difficult to get the entire work team on the same page, understaffed often, hours get reduced during the non tourists months (winter)."
good,Great energy and friendly staff. Always willing to teach us new things and very patient with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating relationships with new friendly faces.
good,"As a pharmacy tech, I would fill prescriptions, assist patients with medications, order medications, etc. It was always busy, every day, but we got the workload handled and completed in a timely manner. I enjoyed being able to see my friends who I worked with each day. It was all-in-all a great experience."
good,very customer oriented environment.  There is always something to do to remain busy throughout your scheduled day.  Management is welcoming and available to teach and listen when needed.
good,"Retail pharmacy is the same everywhere now. CVS is a money-making machine. I admire many of their business practices. Not selling tobacco? That was an awesome choice for a health-focused company. CVS strives to make the customer experience as delightful as possible, and that comes at a cost. The culture at CVS is entirely at the expense of its employees. Our pharmacy became a revolving door of employees, and that's a common practice in retail pharmacy now. They pay relatively competitively, and management can create flexible scheduling options upon request, but honestly, there is not any company that can protect its employees from the perils of retail pharmacy anymore. I was incredibly lucky that I had a fantastic manager. The permanent fixtures of my team were really great. But when we closed the gates at the end of each day, we appeared to have escaped Alcatraz. CVS isn't a terrible company to work for. If you thoroughly enjoy retail pharmacy, I recommend it."
good,"Long Term Care setting is low stress, but limited opportunities for advancement. Similar to a call-center setting where there are no patients coming in. Primary customer are the nurses/med aides at nursing homes."
good,"I didn’t like working at cvs. It was awful, the management always took the customers side instead of the employees. It was very frustrating working there."
good,My group was the first to try an online live course in how to do this job. It was a mess. When we were talking to people live we had almost no help. When you go to a faculity and their most senior person has 3 years. That should be a red flag.
good,"There is a good work energy with stable management however the workload & small amount of time, available work hours and staff bring it down. Lots of work with not enough workers or hours for the staff on hand means something is usually compromised."
good,i enjoyed my stay the people where friendly everyone was helpful i was sad when the shut down the office and moved to Texas with hope i look forward to working for you again
good,"Not enough hours for techs. The company is set on saving as much as they can, however everyone who works behind the pharmacy knows that we need more help than ever before with gaining a majority of Rite Aid customers."
good,"I think the Job was okay, staff was nice but I couldn't get over the method of picking orders, going back and forth on either side of the aisle especially at a quick pace, it can lead to mistakes. 25 yrs. as a truck driver, I've seen plenty of different ways in picking inventory. If they had it where I could just pick orders on one side of the aisle first and return back to the starting point doing the opposite side I would be there today ...easily achieving that 95% rate. The job is 50/50 it will appeal to some better than others."
good,Working at CVS was a great experience it allowed me the knowledge and skills i needed to perform my job well. The store manager was a great role model.
good,Cvs was a great place to work . You can do so much there . If you want to move up that’s great or if you want to change that’s great too . Great family place to work
good,really over worked. kept right at the max allowable for part time never enough staff and the pay was horrible. truly not a great place to work. they care about the money not the person.
good,I wish they would pay you according to the work you do compared to the teammates that get paid the same as you and get no work done. And I would upgrade the technology to effectively do our jobs.
good,From what I remember it was ok to work there as my first job not a lot of room for advancement but a lot leeway while working there the people were great and the benefits were good
good,"Entering the pharmacy and start by going to the computer and printing all prescriptions needed to be filled for that day. Assist with answering the telephone for patient questions and concerns,calling insurance offices for  billing questions and doctor office questions and concerns reguarding prescriptions. I assisted in mixing liquid suspension and also keep store inventory. I had a job of entering prescriptions into the database, print out the label once finished, go and find the medication needed and pour out on a counting tray. Count the adequate amount needed to fill that prescription, place that medication in the appropriate medication vial with the label neatly placed on bottle, place in basket in order by the time printed on the patient information sheet for the pharmacist to do the final check. Assist in final transactions and keeping the store clean. Somewhat stressful at time because of patients wanting to get medications filled early or insurance not paying for medication. I love the job. I love to help people"
good,Position is entry level. Rare opportunities of growth with in the position. Stay for a while to network and move out ! The team was great however the direction was unclear. Because of the many acquisitions goals changed constantly and re-orgs were inevitable.
good,CVS Health was a great place to work. The schedule was flexible and there were always problems to solve. I learned how to direct a team and more about management. The work keeps you on your toes.
good,I get along great with all the employees and the customers but corporate has made it hard to keep your job and stressful to work here. The company has been going though restructureing has made everything harder.
good,They always seemed to mess up my payroll. When i left the company I tried to pay them back for the overages and they kept loosing the checks i sent them and threatened to take me to court randomly. Though I had cashier checks and tracking numbers.
good,Mostly a pleasant place to work however it can get stressful at times. It really depends on how your coworkers are as long as they are nice the work is manageable.
good,"It’s what you make it. Corporate does seem to try and get you to do more and more every year with less help. Overall, the company is flexible with schedules and has some great benefits. Just depends on your immediate supervisor as to what your experience will be"
good,"Micromanagement, no opportunities for professional growth. Mandatory for overtime. Promotions and bonuses receiving relatives and people who were hired for "" special projects"". Not a bad place for people with no experience in the pharmacy, because of not bad salary in comparison with other pharmacies."
good,"Working at CVS is challenging at times, but rewarding too. This is a good company to work for if you like to be challenged and have pressures of time management and multi-tasking."
good,"Its a local neighborhood company who can help new pharmacy interns put their time in to complete their education careers and start them up once complete, other wise good high school begging job and retail training."
good,"Just like Walgreen, don't expect easy workload. If you're determined to be someone significant in your future, work hard and never get discourage then you will succeed."
good,"Cvs Health wants store managers to work for free non stop in minimal hours stores it’s just you and you pray your have at least one good shift manager, there’s not much support . If you give and inch they will run a mile with you and take advantage."
good,"Busy pharmacy with many patients, did prescription entry, filling and labeling.  Direct contact with patients and their insurance issues, and questions."
good,everyone helped each other and looked out for each other. everyone was always friendly and no one ever had to ask for help if they where struggling. it was overall a great environment to work in.
good,"Let me just say this I absolutely love the WFH part of my job however, this job is very stressful! the members are extremely rude and there are always calls that are harder due to inadequate training on certain topics. I also don't like the fact that u are stuck with your schedule once u finish training there is no flexibility on that. If there were part time positions available this would be the best job ever."
good,Very fast paced but typical retail scenario.  CVS has really great benefits and pretty good work schedules.  Decent management job too.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,They work you to death. They don’t really care for their employees. They add more work to a work day and take away hours. Employees don’t get a lunch break on most days.
good,"Difficult hours, demanding job, low flexibility. Eleven years of experience and difficult to get any seniority. Seems like they do not care much about the employees."
good,The job was pretty easy and repetitive. Pay was decent. The only reason I left was because of the manger. She was a cool person but she didn’t keep her word often.
good,When I started it was a great job. It was fast paced and a little stressful but you would recognized for the hard work and effort you put in. I started to receive more responsibility eventually but then my old Manager got promoted and the whole store culture changed. The new manager started firing good employees that had worked with the company for years. Loss prevention is not taken seriously in the company .
good,CVS Health understaffs it's locations and expects good results. This results in overworked and less than enthusiastic staff. The pay is low compared to other similar businesses.
good,"Most of the supervisor request metric, however most of the  can not  work a case in the time  we get requested to complete them. Request of  Mandatory Overtime is tracked if  unable to make it, need to reschedule  a make up time."
good,"Get ready to multitask and run around for your entire shift and always be short on staff. The staff is great, but more employees need to be hired, or on at one time. The job can be rewarding at times, but with little compensation and customers who do not care at all for the employees."
good,"I worked at this job for 5 years. There was not much room for promotion after you became a shift lead. I worked in the front of the store and in the pharmacy. For me, this was one of those companies that will take advantage of hard workers."
good,"Not the place to work if you're a smoker.  Does not make accommodations for smokers.  You have to walk off campus which is 5min walk to and 5 min back, a total of 10mins walk time of a 15min break. Doesn't leave much time to actually smoke a full cigarette or bathroom time or to get a snack."
good,"All in all, its a decent place to work but it wasn't for me. I graduated from college and could not see myself staying at CVS. I wanted more for me and that's all."
good,CVS was fun to work at at times but the managers could make or break your experience there. Things were often done in less than ideal ways and most managers are stuck in their ways to notice better ways to do things.
good,There is no advancement and full-time opportunities are non-existent.  The family atmosphere went away after a short time with the company. I left the first time I got a full-time offer.
good,"Day to day: "
good,This position is quite a simple one and was extraordinarily intellectually boring. There is nothing managerial about the position. I would say the position is appropriate for a kid in high school or early on in college.
good,over work you and refuse to hire extra technicians and they keep you to this stupid budgeted hours and follow it to a t or every one us unhappy and you have to do 4 peoples jobs at once
good,"I really have nothing to say. CVS has lots of room for advancement major company to work for supervisors can some time be picky about their team. Their disciplining is made up as they go, my opinion"
good,CVS is not a bad company if you are looking for a first job out of high school and want to get a promotion to a shift manager or already have an educational background for the pharmacy.  If you are a cashier you are always alone in the front while the manager is busy elsewhere.  If you are a parent without help for your kids and need special hours this job will not accommodate your needs willingly without cutting your hours first
good,Not enough hours. Expect to much from employees with no hours. No flexibility. Not allowed to voice opinion. Keep cutting hours. Hours hours hours hours
good,It was interesting working with multiple different types of people every day.  Days were very busy which I enjoyed because I wanted the days to go fast.
good,"Cvs is a ok company to work for. You can move up pretty quick but part time workers do not receive benefits. Also there is usually just one worker so you have to stock, make price changes, etc while helping customers and checking the customers out"
good,"developed skills necessary to become a successful pharmacist - patient counseling, drug knowledge, communication with MDs and insurance companies"
good,"Friendly and relaxed environment. The people there are hard working and knowledgeable employees. The time that I was there, I was contracting so I'm not sure about the benefits."
good,"CVS is a typical work place, You will always be on your fee helping the customers with filling their prescriptions. All replace the medicine and keep everything in order."
good,I enjoyed working for Cvs my first 4 years. They are flexible with hours for me when we have the help because I needed that while being a mom to 2 children.
good,The company is very outgoing. To work within is a little stressful because they don’t take care of you. It’s a nice job to have throughout college to support your needs. To move up in the company means devoting yourself to the company and it being able to have a life.
good,"Very rewarding to finish the day, since they can be long. Management does a good job keeping the pharmacy running. The hardest part of the job is juggling all of the tasks you have to do while helping customers at the same time."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a member of the management team and a sales associate. The workload capacity exceeds the manpower which becomes very challenging to accomplish tasks in a timely manner. Management members are designated an area of concentration, however, are required to interact with the entire store overall including the pharmacy area."
good,The district manager made my last month experience sad for me😢 it made the previous 12 years there feel like what I did for the company was useless. The pay was bad.
good,District manager and above have little or no idea about the way the store runs. They expect impossible things to be done without providing adequate resources and as a result morale is at a low level
good,Coworkers and staff is great. However the company handles everybody and the workload horribly. Not enough staff ever for a shift. No security while stores are consistently robbed. No real benefits to amount for the lack of care the company has for employees.
good,With all the new hires CVS HEALTH forgets intend to they old hires all new hires get pay more when the old hires stuff with no bonus no raise meanwhile they took over ATNEA so why we can't get a raise RIDICULOUS!!!!
good,If your looking for part time job this would be the place. Unless you like to work with medication for proscriptions then go into working in the pharmacy. Working at cvs can be stressful sometimes relaxed depends on location.
good,"• Calculate dosages, dispense medications, prepare prescription labels and fill prescriptions for approval by pharmacist"
good,"It nice place to work at you learn a lot there, and enjoy helping the patients.  It is a good stepping stone within the corporate world.Great place to learn about things."
good,When you arrive you already have asks laid and planned out for you to accomplish. While you are doing that you must assist customers and and fix items that looks disorganized while stocking the store and utilizing the register for purchase transactions
good,"Loved working here, but things have recently been coming to light and in big ways. Hard work and dedication isn't appreciated here. You can cover every open shift, travel to every other store that needs help but it doesn't get anywhere. The minute your car breaks and you can't cover one of those shifts all of a sudden you are frowned upon. One minor slip up, forget about a reputation or respect."
good,"I love working at CVS because my coworkers are amazing. They're all friendly with a great sense of humor and an excellent work ethic. I don't know if this is specific to my location or across all CVS pharmacies but I feel blessed with the co-associates I have. They make dealing with difficult patients a bit easier. Speaking of, one of the most challenging parts about working at CVS pharmacy are the patients. 60% of them are nice while the other 40 are impatient, angry or just plain rude. This and the fact that CVS doesn't compensate you well enough. They can definitely afford to pay us more, especially because their pharmacies are the backbone of revenue and we deal with so much on a daily basis."
good,"Don't expect a full pharmacy tech experience. Most of your time will be spent ringing up customers, and answering disgruntled people as to why they have to pay a 1.00 copay for a 3 month prescription. If you want more pharmacy technician work, and less customer service, avoid a pharmacy with a drive-thru."
good,"A typical day in retail pharmacy is assisting customers with billing, refills, new prescriptions, and various issues the customers may inquire about. I actually like being a pharmacy technician, but I do not like the short staffing/hours the company allot to the pharmacy manager. I believe better staffing equals better customer service, which in turn leads to better reviews and more profit."
good,"Review I love training as a pharmacy tech. I love working with the people. I learned how to key scripts data entry filling prescriptions. This was the 1st pharmacy for the pharmacist.  I got hired by the store mgr and he made me full time. I believe she didn't like the fact she didn't get to pick her own full timer. All of them were young so they had a lot incommon."
good,Worked retail and helped customers manage their prescription status. The shifts are busy depending on the store but also hardworking whenever it gets super busy.
good,"Depending on where you work and the people you work with makes CVS life either enjoyable or pure torture. If you have co-workers who care about their job, willing to put in good work, be on time, and great people, then the job is amazing. Of course the opposite is true, same with any job to be honest. The hours are usually pretty flexible and, depending on management, they can help work around your school or second job hours."
good,Worked long enough here so have no comments to give regarding this company. The short term stay was great and I enjoyed my time working there. Ok on the pay scale
good,"Working here was amazing only because I loved the people I worked with. My boss was super kind and genuinely cared about his job and employees. As for the CVS Company itself it does have a lot to work on. Unfortunately, they did not seem to care much for the employees especially those who work so hard. Most people would work more than their required shifts because most stores are 24 hours. I would say many of my co workers were overworked with little compensation."
good,Pay not so good if non-pharmaceutical experience or training.Fast paced with really good benefits and corporate support. Very organized and customer friendly.
good,It's an okay place to work. I believe it all depends on the people you work with and the environment they create. Any job can be great or be stressful.
good,They like to utilize upper management without proper training.  They need to hold them more accountable instead of the Store Managers.  Everyone in Upper Management seems to have never worked in a store level position.
good,"It pays the few Bill's I have, but on my 5th manager in less than 2 years, says it all, needs to improve communication with employees better, should of explored other opportunities"
good,I learned a lot about the insurance and pharmacy field. Management overall is decent. Most enjoyable part about working at this company would be helping others and educating the members on their plans and medication making a big difference in their understanding.
good,My experience with CVS Pharmacy was not the best. I can agree that coworkers were the most helpful at training you for the job. The only thing I can complain sometimes was the lack of employees for a 24hr store. There can be better management.
good,Company has potential. They should take time to listen to employee outputs for better services and ratings. Registers require to much time from the patience and it’s because cvs is ants to ask questions that should have already been updated in the system
good,"When CVS came in things changed. Management got to be a pain, quotas changed without notice and the atmosphere became tense. The work was easy but no way to advance in the company or move around"
good,The hours & the staffing schedule is terrible. I mean terrible. There’s almost always only 1 Tech & 1 pharmacist on the busiest days during the week. Sometimes it’s stressful & almost nothing gets done
good,I enjoyed working there I just think that they need to hire more employees so there is enough help to do a sufficent job and everybody is taking care of and stays safe
good,good place to work and grow. Pharmacists and employees empower each other. Learn a lot about pharmaceutical companies and their products. hours flexible
good,It was good job. No enough hours. Customer Service was good. Got along with some staff not all. Manager was terrible. Everything was good. Pay was okay.
good,"Morning and night shift."
good,Great company just not of a lot of chances to move up. The are a ton of store location across the company making it easy for anyone to get a job across the us.
good,"Overall my time was short, but I truly had very few complaints. Work was consistent and not overly stressful. Good customer service was the biggest concern."
good,"This is a good first call center job, but if you have a hard time keeping still, this might not be the best place for you. Calls come in back to back, so fast moving and if that is not your cup of tea don't apply."
good,I had the pleasure of having some of the best management behind me however the work environment was very stressful on a daily basis. I worked for a specific escalation team that had specific projects and queues to maintain but the call center was always understaffed which made us have to fill in and meet the needs of the business. This made it extremely hard and overwhelming to maintain our work which in then  does not satisfy the customers and  requires a lot of extra hours. Having an overworked team is bad for morale and leaves tensions high and  a bigger opportunity for error.
good,"if you are store manager be prepared to put in 50+ hours every week.  you are pretty much doing everything from office work to cleaning bathrooms, because cvs keeps cutting hours so you are unable to schedule people."
good,Good learning experience. Well around help savings. Very easy to follow the flow and customer service. Meeting and learning new people. And enjoying making and seeing smiles
good,"I worked at CVS Pharmacy since approximately 5 months. I love working because I meet new customers daily, and make new friends. I enjoy the environment in the Pharmacy when there is low work-load; and, the best part of working in Pharmacy is when majority of employees are working together to finish pending works. I love helping customers and getting positive feedback for myself,"
good,"Very fast paced and hard work. They put too much on your pay which is not worth it with the pay, Not enough hours allowed to do all the work and open every holiday ."
good,The people you work with are great but CVS does not pay well and take care of you at all. It is a fast moving job. Don't plan on getting any breaks and when you do get a break (like for lunch) plan on working off the clock.
good,"Loved working at CVS, it was pretty easy, relaxed and flexible. It would get stressful during the busy rushes with couponers, but overall one of the easiest jobs I've had. Downside is management only cares about how the store looks and the numbers, he didn't solve any other problems that employees had. Also, CVS looks at their employees as potential thieves instead of it's customers."
good,"The environment is multicultural and friendly, team work is a custom, everyone is always willing to help.  Management make it easy by providing distraction to help make the day goes smoothly."
good,"Working at cvs there was a lot of multitasking involved. Greeting customers, showing customers where items were located in store, waiting on customers at the register. Answering phone calls, putting merchandise away that were returned or customers did not want to purchase."
good,"Not a bad place for part-time work. Every day is pretty straightforward; after clocking in, you sign onto a register and count the money. If the amount of money in the register is correct then you can start ringing people up, if not, you call a shift supervisor and they fix it."
good,"Very fast pace company with limited training before one is ""let go"" to do their duties. The benefits are amazing. There is a lot of favoritism. When there is an issue among employees the management tends to turn their heads."
good,"Overall a 3 but  they do provide solid benefits, vacation and holiday pay.  Work hours are consistant and not overwhelming.  Solid company overall as a whole."
good,I wish they would give more hours per week and I wouldn’t like more pharmacy experience but other than that I liked the company and would go back if I could
good,"Lots of standing and organizing, but with a very small crew, there is little time for chatting and the chances of being robbed are quite high.The night shift was pretty cool."
good,"There is restructuring that has affected management & compensation. This restructuring may be of benefit in other areas of the country. Presently I am working in Austin & the limitations of pay makes it difficult to find qualified people who work. Presently I have not received the time needed for training to move into the Pharmacy area of the store."
good,"okay place to work, gets bills paid. if you are just looking for a job, it may or may not be the place for you. depending on your area, depends on the pay you will recieve."
good,"The Company does not value employees like they say and team members does not work together because the team deals with their ego, who's  better then the next instead of lifting each other up. The raises are not that great unless you are favored."
good,"A typical day at work involves filling prescriptions while using proper verification steps to deliver the right drug to the right patient without any contraindications. Pharmacist supervises technicians to ensure efficient work flow, being compliant with state and federal laws, and providing the best possible patient care. Best part of the job is getting to know your staff and working as team to reach a common goal."
good,"Not much opportunity for career growth, however, it is a simple job with simple tasks that anyone can do. The pay is fine and so are the hours. A more engaging and extensive training period would be nice, just to avoid any future mistakes. I found myself learning a lot through trial and error since there wasn't much training at all; I just ""ghosted"" a co-worker on the first day and quickly got the hang of it. Regardless, it was a job that I would regard as just being ""okay"". Nothing more, nothing less."
good,CVS Health is a great job for 18-25 if you really want a fast working pace job than that’s the job for you! With paid overtime 1.5x is wondering & raises every 6months!
good,"You are the first thrown under the bus. No back up from manager. Store manager been at cvs for years, but makes it clear he does not care anymore. Suspended ""pend investigaton"" was never called for status. Working a new Job and 8mo. Later, still have not received phone call or communication  When applied for unemployment, management lied to Unemployment about how I left. Spineless with no backing"
good,"While initially the company seemed to start off in the right direction, I found that the hours were too unstable to continue as an employee. The management was nice enough but the incentive to move up the ladder was taken away with no pay raises for receiving certifications."
good,I worked at a CVS near a hospital so it is possible the customers were getting bad news and then came in to take it out on the staff. Understaffed for how busy it is. Often it was me and my manager. /my manager would do her job in the office and I was expected to do sidework like stock shelves while assisting customers and also be the cashier.
good,"Was great at first, but many changes to management led me to pursue a new choice of career. My opinions weren't very valued and the constant changes in leadership led to many clashes in ideals and practices."
good,Meeting people wish there where more people working there in my race helping the customers greeting the customers making them leave satisfied with a smile
good,"CVS is a fun workplace that after a certain time, You start to become drained and that's a feeling that you will only start to have when you go to work (CVS). Co-workers are the only thing that may keep you working there, other than that you'll just leave after maybe 3-6 months, I had a great experience with my assistant manager but my general manager was stern but didn't mean harm but I was a person that couldn't understand stern all the time, So that's something you'll have to learn real quick."
good,"Unfair call flow, the better and faster you were the more calls you received. So you would have back to back calls and coworkers that were slower and less sufficient would get less calls. Doesn’t make sense to do more work then someone else and get paid the same amount or less. Scheduling is strict, you are more than 10 mins late it’s a half occurrence, and more than 30 it’s an occurrence. Hard to get days off approved, you’re almost forced to call in. If you have kids that get sick and you need to stay home, this is not a family friendly company to work for."
good,When I started here it was ok. I started to notice people don't talk to you or invite you to do any gatherings in this pharmacy. The management there are good.
good,"family orientated, great job if you like overtime and repetitive actions throughout the day."
good,"Working is retail is tough and I was never a fan of working at CVS. Luckily the one i worked at was slow, but there wasn't much motivation to work harder and it never seemed like the type of company where you could advance and make a great career from it."
good,"Working in retail for CVS Pharmacy was challenging, yet I rose to the challenge. The demand in Pharmacy was extremely high and oftentimes we were under scheduled which made the job a little more stressful."
good,"Overall as a company they lack the insight to view the daily activities of staff. Staff is under intense time frames and expectations, however the staff isn't always properly trained. The amount of work is NOT conductive with the amount of hours scheduled. The schedule constantly fluctuates."
good,"very nice  staff whos willing to help train and teach trainees what to do , very comfortable  and not that stressful. reason it was temporary because I was doing work for the work program  when I was 15 years old"
good,"A typical day at work would require half the day to be taking calls with customers such as doctors offices, pharmacies, or patients. And the other half of the day would be on the computer working on Prior Authorizations from different states. I learned a lot about insurance claims and satisfying the customer. The management team at CVS was alright for the most part, understanding personal accommodations and working to better assist your work schedule. The workplace had a lot of diversity and culture involved so everyone was treated the same. The hardest part of the job would be customer satisfactory and getting them to understand the guidelines. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the work schedule it worked perfectly for me."
good,"Typical retail environment. Limited advancement opportunities without relocating or commuting long distances. Some customers are entitled and fussy but the friendly ""regulars"" make the job tolerable."
good,"I worked there for couple of months, the supervisor was very nice and flexible, it was a very busy pharmacy, they hired too much people but did not offer us enough working hours to survive."
good,"Pharmacy was very fast paced, I never recieved proper training from pharmacist or help from other techs, there was simply never time to get the help or attention needed to get better at this job or to even know the basics to being a pharmacy tech. The staff themselves were awesome people. great pay, never enough hours in pharmacy."
good,"Each store depends on the manager. Some managers value there employees some don't. Most difficult thing with CVS is dealing with the public. We have many people who have worked here for over 20 years and they handed out good raises. It pays well for the work that gets done, but there is no longer room to advance within the company and it is hard to get 40 hours a week at smaller stores forget about it."
good,Lots of opportunity at this company but some of the local leadership is weak in the Monroeville office.  There's a typical Pittsburgh atmosphere and a feeling of being second class to colleagues in Rhode Island (HQ) and other key sites.  Finance leaders here lack big picture thinking and often lack strategic focus in comparison to others within the organization.  There is a pervasive hourly mentality in the building.
good,Overall not a bad place. Stressful at times. Work place was not the friendliest. Worked a daily time schedule off a work queue. Needed to finish all work at the end of the day. Needed at least a 98% on all monthly reviews.
good,"Although we have some amazing customers that shop with us, at times issues with coupons can affect the day.  Because hours are low within the company, there is less time available to have one on one with management to learn pertinent skills in order to perform your job correctly.  At times you have management verbally disrespecting staff, but overall it is a ok place to work."
good,"This company offers excellent pay with great raises, but poor management can be make for a bad time. My manager, for example, always has and negative attitude and has ran off good employees being this way."
good,"I like my team a lot, just wish I could relocate closer to home. Have been traveling one hour each way for 5 years and have not been able to move closer"
good,a typical day at work was long and seldom fully staffed.the hardest part of job not enough staff for the work load. the most enjoyable part of the job was the support I received from my co-workers.
good,The company has a solid work ethic and infrastructure however management is not reliable to assist fresh employees in adjusting to the company. Would recommend only to experienced programmers coming in to work a full-time position.
good,Productive place to work. Great co-workers. Job requires great attention to detail and commitment to completing tasks. Opportunity to hep customers receive orders.
good,this is a tough environment  customers hold the pharmacy responsible for every thing.  I have learned a lot and it helped me to achieve my national certification. No two stores are alike .
good,"It's your typical retail job, quality of work is highly dependent on your staff's effort to do their job well and the clientele type your shopper's are."
good,"Went through about 150 referrals every day, very diverse, the hardest part of the job was sitting for 8.5 hours, the best part of the job was being able to personalize your own space."
good,overall great starting point in career. but looking to expand skills and experience . I would like to mention that if you are interested in working here that you will need to have a great work ethic and great customer service experience.
good,"CVS Health is a great place to work. You will get pushed beyond your limits, but the skills and knowledge that you will gain from this place cannot be reciprocated anywhere else. Teamwork is very key when working for this company, and will make life 10 times easier and better"
good,"its a constant learning experience not only in the field but with customers overall great company to work it, the only bad - raises are not that great and there are no employee bonuses or incentives"
good,"Soon as I would start my shift the manager would brief me on how the day went , hand me the keys and give me priorities of the day before I began my regular manager routine . My regular routine consisted of counting the safe, drawers , putting workers in the right position to have a successful day and online manager work. I learned to be a complete manager because soon as I would start my shift I would become the manager based off of the actual manager leaving whenever I showed up. The workplace culture was cut throat , no matter how nice and helpful I was people always disliked me, I had a reputation for being too strict although I personally felt I was too nice. The most difficult part about being a manager at CVS was attempting to please everyone from customers , co workers ,vendors ect , I always wanted to take on all of the stress because I knew I could take it."
good,Great and dedicated people to work with. Able to telecommute. Good pay structure. Challenging work environment. Authority and responsibility to make changes.
good,"Typically the customers would only keep me busy 50% of the time, but I had a lot of side work that would allow me to have things to do when a customer didn't need me. My coworkers were helpful and funny as well."
good,Fast Paced environment with a lot of things to learn in a very short period of time. Management is always cutting hours making it harder to work efficiently with less staff
good,Many changes that are putting more and more tasks on pharmacists that are taking time away from having the time to appropriately verify prescriptions and counsel patients. Very focused on metrics and numbers.
good,I learned a lot during my time at CVS that I still use until this day. As my first real job out of high school it was a good learning experience as to how to perform and compose yourself under stressful situations.
good,Good compensation and benefits packages are offered to pharmacists here however the staffing models utilized lead to long wait times for patients/customers. Pharmacists and technicians become the target for all frustrations with no support from the upper management.
good,"It was a great work place to be a part of.  We were all close, drama free and made sure we took care of our clients as well as the nursing staff. Awesome"
good,"CVS Health is a youth oriented organization. Professionals over fifty fear for their jobs. Middle age professionals are intimidated and made to feel uncomfortable and fearful, even tho they perform."
good,This job got boring very quickly because the amount of business being done each day was very minimal. Even on the busiest days there was not a whole lot going on and was too slow paced for me
good,"Learning and growing into a position that I can excel and advance in is the overall goal"
good,Unless you are full time you will get little to no hours. They were a great place to work for but as time went on it got worse. Not the people you worked with. The company itself.
good,Its a okay company; nothing to special they will train you and will work you you agreed schedule but not much room for growth; poor leadership but clean store
good,"Tuff job to keep do to the Rigorous Work  environment. Hard to meet job standards, do change of rules at any moment. You will work rain,  sleet, snow and if sick. The job fleet like a big high school. The summer times it extremely hot inside and in the winter it extremely cold. You get two 20min Brakes and be sure to bring your own food because the cafeteria is expensive. And the food is recycled through the week. One day you will eat one thing then later on that week you will eat the leftovers."
good,Would not allow me to transfer to a nearby store even though it was very hard for me to commute to work every day. I tried very hard to get transferred but had to leave at the end when no one would help.
good,a typical day at work was very productive and although busy very well organized. what i learn while working has been how to work in a tram environment and as well as time management skills. management was always very attentive to the needs and concerns of each and every employee. the workplace culture was a team that work well and supported each other in all daily tasks. hardest part of the job was to always want to help and so as much as could with in the 8-10 hour shifts. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and accomplishing personal and professional goals while growing with the company.
good,"Engaged leadership.  Engaged with the hourly Associates.  People know what is going on.  Transparent, you don't have to guess at anything.  Leadership listens."
good,"CVS is okay to work for. Granted, they do not staff properly, create a high stress environment, and harass their customers with multiple phone calls weekly."
good,"Nice clean environment. co-workers were very nice. Can get busy, but everyone works together to jump in when the going gets rough. Love the team spirit most of all."
good,My CVS location is under new hire and the store is starting to shape in place. I definitely am seeing good outcomes with customers and helping them our best customer service.
good,This job was great learning experience and stepping stone for me. the training was very specific but very valuable. The team i worked with was great. they enriched the experience for me.
good,"CVS was my first job and I stayed there off and on for about 6 years total, with a couple breaks for school semesters. It definitely didn’t pay a livable wage and when minimum wage went up, I never received compensation for experience or tenure, which was constantly frustrating. There were frequent issues with staffing, so corners were cut and work done poorly. A manager once told me that I needed to stop doing things to the best of my ability because I was wasting time fixing shelves that had been stocked incorrectly. At the time, CVS still sold tobacco and I do think it is an excellent choice that they no longer carry these products."
good,Very busy and not enough teammates to fulfil daily expectations. Management did not schedule accordingly which resulted in individual teammates struggling during work hours.
good,The typical day at work was very busy. You will hardly get time for break. It was a very well learning experience as well. The most enjoyable part was learning new things everyday.
good,Was call center experience sometimes good sometimes not so good but I enjoyed my time there. Training was short n sweet and taught what was needed to know to perform my duties.
good,The technicians always help each other to get customers checked out in a timely manner. Recieved deliveries everyday for no delays for the customer to recieve their medications.
good,The time I was there it was not a bad place to work at all.  Reasonable hours and consistent schedule. would recommend for a first time job for a teenager
good,"It was a great place to work and helped me start my career. I would recommend this company as a good first job, but not as a job for a life long career."
good,"Management leaves much to be desired. Often time it seems those in management are only wiling to ""groom"" subordinates to a point. That point being where they may outshine those in current positions."
good,"fill prescriptions"
good,Cvs is a good employer but it is flowed in several way. The work load is unbalanced and unfair to hard working employees. Managers are rude and disrespectful unless you are a favorite employee.  Overall people would stay longer if treated fairly
good,I wouldn't go back due to the fact you never know how many hours a day you are working until half way through your shift.  good people just lack of communication when you first start training with how the hours work.
good,"He should have been let go for lack of understanding each employee's goals and experiences. Otherwise, other departments were great to work in. Needs better technologies options to move forward."
good,"Come to work log on to your computer an begin answering calls from patients, Solving all aspects of medical issues as far as mediation and recommendation is concerned."
good,I was put in a department that I did not apply for. I applied for phrmacy tech nd instead I got put doing bathroom cleaning and stock merchandise. The customer offten have some kind of disagreement with 2 or more employees
good,"This position is very demanding and full of many tasks. Everyday you’ll have many projects and such to accomplish while leading a team. And also be ready for a lot of customer engagement during those times because you will be the go to for the location for everyone, you generally will be working solo with one cashier and your pharmacy."
good,Started working in retail straight out of high school till i finished college. Great experience in working in a fast paced environment. Great to sharpen your people skills and dealing with customers of all kinds.
good,Invest in Employees who want to move up; minimal training; professional discontent; Discounts are probably the best perk offered here if you do the work to find the coupons as well.
good,If you love working in a call center environment with medicine and health I would recommend CVS. They also have a large selection of different departments to move up too.
good,Target certain coworkers on the job lack the responsibility for providing quality care for customers managers do the schedule and cut your hours always an issue with paychecks take away from your pay always a problem
good,"Enjoyed being a pharmacy technician.  Management more obsessed with ""numbers"" rather than one on one patient care.  The patients were the best part of working there and the satisfaction from helping them was awesome."
good,"it is retail pharmacy, i've only worked here at cvs part time so not much to say about it. if you have a good store then you will enjoy yourself. it all depends on where you work"
good,"It was a solid job. The workplace was always hectic. I have built a good relationship with my co-workers and the employees. "
good,You need to have a lot of patience in order to work here. Rude customers and a lot of older people come here. They expect to be treated extremely great. Or they will get very angry.
good,Even though they train in all the areas of the pharmacy.  I had the opportunity to work at the drive through or the pick up.  Not a friendly place of work at that particular location.
good,I learned alot here and it helped me grow and become more familiar with things that I wasnt before it gave me motivation and interest in following a career in retail
good,Great job if you like costomer service. At CVS their drive is costomer assistance and maintaining a clean store. if you like either of these then working at CVS would be a great job for you.
good,"CVS is a great company to work but the management system is very poor, because they don't have the best routine to know how the employs are working. If an employe never seen by the clothe boss at least ones  in a year and leave the employ and give the responsibility to the lead there is a gap that hurts the company and the employee."
good,"They grade you on everything, if you have one bad survey or bad ""grade"" you get a ""talk"" , they dont have enough hours. they over worked you and you have millions of things to do and its only u and another tech with pharmacist most of the time. stressed most of the day and to top it off. the max pay for a tech is 19$. thats nothing for all the work you do. You have PCQ, RTS, FIlling, Filing, TYping (u get less then 8 minutes before it gets red while your helping the phone and the line) putting away the orders every day and working on out of stocks , and thats all before 1230pm and many other things"
good,Job is easy overall. Hours aren't great and they are constantly cutting hours due to over revenue loss. Management varies on what store you are at. Some are great and some are terrible. District Manager is awful and gets no respect from managers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Omnicare / CVS. We worked as a team and was able to meet our daily deadline. My staff respected each other and was always there for each other. We were like a family. I always enjoyed helping my nursing home Nurses, Doctors and Director of Nurses because it made there life easier in assisting the patient and families in resolving there issues."
good,"the overnight staff was great, customer flow was good. Just the store manager had his issues with us. Granted getting let go wasn't fair for me but it was what it was."
good,"I liked the fact that there was always something to do. If you had a question about a medication, the pharmacist or co-worker were there to help you.."
good,Very Similar to All Chain Pharmacies. I didn't get many hours since they had a budget to follow. No training was given and staff was always shorthanded.
good,I love working at CVS. It is a fast paced job.  The benefits are good.  They offer work from home.  They also have unlimited over time so you can make your pay check what you want it to be.
good,"While i loved the team I worked with directly, I felt the company's demands were not reasonable with the amount of support  (people/time) given, leading to a high stress environment."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching my teams to be detailed oriented, helping them create the documentation and process tools to minimize project risk, increase knowledge base and encourage them ask the right questions at meetings. This approach made my teams strong, in control , better able to manage expectations and they felt valued and engaged as a result. I was able to see the team become strong and them grow personally and professionally in a positive manner as a result."
good,"I wish there were more things that they offered to the pharmacists as well as technicians.  It was a great company environment since it was previously another company, but after CVS bought it, I didn't think it offered a whole lot."
good,"Working at the CVS location was very fast pace with and extreme large retail pharmacy clients daily."
good,"Support the Pharmacy Manager in leading and directing the "
good,"I have daily tasks to complete, while managing multiple meetings and completing the tasks requested from those meetings.  Very loud work area, hard to think. Work a lot from home, at night, to complete work that I am not able to finish throughout the day.  Have multiple communications from Senior Leadership in different directions for the same task."
good,"I took the job because it was the only job offer I had. Micro management. Classroom training was intense. If you failed a particular test, you were given the opportunity to retest.... (lots of classmates were retaking tests)  Not enough training and they knew it. They show a video at the end of training trying to convince you that the feelings you have regarding job knowledge are “excitement “ and not nervous/worry or fear. You learn by the mistakes you make.....now that I think about it...., it’ has an ordinary call Center mentality😖"
good,"for the most part it's just plain ole retail work, my co workers were cool. organizing stuff in the back wasn't too hard to do, stocking shelves was easy enough."
good,Working at cvs was stressful there were not enough employees in the pharmacy so many days we were hours behind on filling prescriptions. The people I worked with were all nice people and we all remain friends.
good,It was my first and only time. I wouldn't do it again.  To be let go because my pick time wasn't at 100% but was 96% was ridiculous. It could be good for some but it wasn't for me.
good,The ability to help My clients to ensure their members can obtain their medication. When I would receive urgent calls that A client has A member having issues at a local pharmacy and you have the ability to educate  the client  and the member
good,"Meeting customers and trying to create good customer service, making sure that customers I met were happy to have met me, meeting their needs . I must make sure that my staffs were well trained to be good customer pleasers."
good,"In a typical day, a pharmacy technician completes a variety of duties within the pharmacy. A major part of this is customer service oriented. Some customers can be pretty unkind, especially about insurance issues that you have no control over."
good,"Busy day most days. If retail stores were staffed better, things would go much more smoothly and patient care would be must better. Company should allow pharmacies to staff stores better."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but others did not.  I think all big companies have issues.  The benefits started to become not so great.  promoting  opportunity was based on who you knew and how popular you were, but that was in specific departments."
good,Fun place to work once you learn the store & the merchandise. Just wish my schedule could have accommodated my secondary job. So that I could have continued working both jobs.
good,"It's good if you like to stay busy and handle people. In the area I used to be in work was great because of great customers. Now where I'm at I hate going to work because customers are rude, mean and treat you like dirt."
good,I don't remember much but I think it was great company I was only there temporary and moved on after the assignment was over. Started working for another company
good,"Cool place to work always meeting new people. Very fast pace, only thing is this job is really for someone who doesn't really want to move around in then company ."
good,"Very good place to start to gain experience into the general pharmacy aspect of overall healthcare and help develop a sense of wellness and health through a health-driven environment,."
good,"Not a bad place, works with you when it comes to sceduling. Alot of training over the computer, wants everyone trained accordingly to what there position is."
good,"CVS Caremark was a call center. You worked in a cubicle with a headset and filled mail order prescriptions all day. You received a lot of calls and they want you to stay within a certain time limit. I had a lot of patients that were mad at CVS for the services they provided, but i was the one on the phone. Had to do a lot of calming & reassuring patients. I was good at it."
good,"CVS Health is a large corporate entity with lots of stakeholders. The potential to be a truly purpose-driven org is exciting for those who work hard to place purpose at the center of their day-to-day activities. "
good,Great company to work for if you're looking for relocation opportunities. Day to day work is repetitive. Must be flexible to work varied hours and days.
good,People are great.  Tendency to hire from outside left loyalty as a problem.  Large company mentality which led to too much red tape to get things done.
good,I enjoyed doing order entry for Omnicare. I did not like the hours. this job would be great for individuals that don't mind working long hours from mid evening until midnight 0
good,"Doable but stressful at times depending on location. Can get very busy during season. Hours are steady but can also vary. Great company to work for if you are in school, great employee discount. workplace culture is really depending who you work with and how people carry their energy."
good,"Being a Pharmacy Technician is a very demanding job and one in which you are held to a certain level of responsibility. The problems with CVS has always been lack of staff which puts a huge strain on everyone there including patients. Patients should not have to suffer due to the inability of proper staffing by CVS. The technicians are overworked and underpaid."
good,"CVS was a fun place to work, It is more like family here. Everyone works together to complete store orders. Warehouse meetings gave the employees the opportunity to relax and bond with coworkers."
good,"Overall my time at CVS Health can be considered good."
good,"It was a typical box store pharmacy.  I was enamored with many of my fellow employees, and I believe they enjoyed my company at the store level.  CVS like most box store chains is governed by regulations."
good,"CVS is a busy store and most of the time as pharmacist, I didn't have time to talk to patient to give them the most education they should get. All we do as business model , not professional model"
good,"Super busy all of the time and is a total work out once you get out. Manager is very understanding about my school situation however, the cut of hours have been crucial to the team and our ability to finish completely everyday."
good,Able to work Drivers deliver product but are also responsible for a positive customer experience. Our drivers are an essential piece of the efficiently Part- or full-time position May require delivering products Experience in bakery Products and related areas preferred. / Primarily involves Night and AM shifts.
good,"Retail pharmacy is stressful. That's a given. For very high volume stores,there needs to be more trained technician help. This is what is missing. This company is great in many things, but in those stores where volume is high, patient care is going to begin to suffer if profit continues to be pushed while continuing to cut hours."
good,The time I was with CVS pharmacy was a great learning experience due to the amount of customer interface that I experienced with them. As this Job was face to face everyday with all sorts of people good and bad.
good,"good place to get training and license for career set up for life. not a good place to stay. lack of care for hourly employees, but flexible schedule."
good,Sometimes the bigger picture needs to be looked at on an employee to employee basis. The loyalty of an employee should be taken into account when an issue arises that is out of the employee's control.
good,"Counting pills, doing inventory, answering phone calls.  Customer service was a priorty as it is at most places.  Inputing the prescription  was done and then checkedby pharmacist before leaving the store."
good,"Different stores in different places have vastly different employee experiences. Generally management pushes for understaffed pharmacies, with fewer techs and more work for pharmacists. A dangerous recipe for burnout."
good,"When I had a Pharmacist In Charge who cared Work life was great! She ensured the lead Pharmacy Technician didn’t taint the schedule around her life and it was done fairly. After she left things went down hill we had a new PIC who is selfish. They throw prescriptions at you, I worked every holiday since I didn’t have children ( apparently not having kids means I don’t deserve a life) . My hours were tainted and I worked almost every weekend even though it’s supposed to be a rotation. If you have a good team you’ll do great , if not take the experience and leave."
good,Fun place to work. Great healthcare career opportunities with the most amazing customers.(sometimes) Extremely fast paced so its easy for new trainees fall behind.
good,Workload requires pharmacists to work hours weekly over their scheduled shift at no additional compensation.  You never know if your store will be open on a holiday.  The culture  wants you to believe they are customer/health focused but they really want teams to be well oiled machines cranking out as much as possible.
good,No matter where you work if you work in a pharmacy 9/10 times there will be chaos in one way or another. The way we do retail pharmacies these days is not sustainable. Worked in many pharmacies over the past 5 years and it's definitely doable but it can be very stressful.
good,CVS was the firs place I ever applied for and it was my first experience with retail which was great but the environment was very dull and it felt like everyone there just wanted to complete their hours and leave immediately
good,"Very busy/ fat paced. You have to be able to multitask and have excellent consumer service. Teamwork is essential, having a good team makes the day go by easier and faster."
good,"Depending on your area, it can be a great experience or not so much. If you have professional ambitions, real opportunities for growth can be difficult."
good,"CVS was a fine job, I would be doing a disservice to the culture that corporate was trying to create other wise. going into it I had high hopes, the training was fun and engaging, the mission statement was excellent and it seemed the work culture was over all positive.  "
good,"Started my first job at CVS years ago. It's a good place to get introduced into retail, customer service, and/or retail if you are interested in that field."
good,"The position gave me a very low pay, making it, so there was very little reason for me to stay at the job. CVS has a wonderful work environment however I am looking for more financial growth."
good,this time in my life was a learning period. not realizing it was training me for life. management team was great. Typical day can  or could be stressful. that was with any job.
good,"must have a positive attitude"
good,"Good group of people that have gone through a lot of changes over the years, growing from a small hole in the wall operation to a giant facility. This is referring specifically to the mail order location in Lenexa, KS."
good,"Overall, the job is pretty laid back. However, mangager is always in a bad mood and takes it out on others for no reason. He's never approachable and once every 2 weeks, when he tries to be friendly because he took his bipolar medication, you cant trust it so it's wise to keep your distance because the conversation could still go south at any moment. There's no advancement. They overwork you, ask you to more and more than the average person, then continue to promote leads that are already promoted. There's no appreciation nor compensation for all they want you to do, outside of just coming to work and doing what we're supposed to do."
good,"Typical work day is starting your day, customer service, production which is filling prescriptions, working the drive thru, being at drop off which is data entry to input the customer's script, do cycle counts, modules that might be do, pick up for customers who are picking up their scripts, etc."
good,CVS Caremark is a decent place to work.  I do think they should pay more for what the employees do.  It can be stressful and challenging and I think the benefits should be better.
good,"learned time management "
good,"IF you are going into the field of pharmacy then cvs is a ok company to work for but you are better off elsewhere if you are a technician. Cutting of hours, lack of help, and poor upper management are hurting the company on the front lines.90 day scripts and constant calls to make sure we move as much medication as possible seems to be the norm now. Calling someone 4 times in one week is harassment in my book."
good,"CVS is a great company, but the bottom line is how many prescriptions are filled at each location.  I feel sorry for the pharmacists who are responsible for the bottom line.  It seemed as if the more you did, the more they wanted."
good,Working for the company will depend on how well the front store and pharmacy manager operate. Upper management can be hard to contact sometimes when information is needed.
good,After omnicare was acquired by CVS there were several rounds of pharmacy closings and layoffs. Less focus on individualized needs of customers and more on standardization leading to loss of business - which would then directly reflect on the account manager who had no control over corporate policies and rollouts. Increased micromanaging and higher quotas as the integration of CVS continues while ignoring needs of the customers and account management team's concerns
good,"There is always work to do. Making sure customer service is number one. Caring for the customers shopping experience in"
good,"It could be fast-paced and busy which can can be suitable for productivity."
good,Great starter job. You can move up quickly and plenty of training opportunities. Great employee benefits. And you get employee discounts. Good pay and great people
good,"when I work for caremark they didn't treat me right.that's reason why "
good,"CVS is a very fast paced pharmacy, and it is a good starting point for a new technician to gain experience.  The hardest part of the job is learning the billing procedures for each insurance because they change quite often; however, once you get the hang of it and become a pro, you will be a very valuable asset to your pharmacy team."
good,"This is a very fast pace job. I enjoyed working their, but it was hard dealing with a stressed out Pharmacist. I did not receive much training, but I jump in an learned as much as I could from other employees."
good,"very stressful to work at, has to be able to manage phone calls, resolve customer complaints, catch up with company metrics, and regular pharmacy operation supervision at the same time, while delivering outstanding customer service."
good,"good place to work . little old fashioned technologies."
good,"I was always kept busy, either with restocking or working on planograms. I enjoyed getting to know the regulars and helping customers. My main issue was we had so much backstock in most of our catagories, we had way more than we needed and not enoough space"
good,The store I started with was very flexible with hours and accommodated for their employees shifting schedules (many were students going to college) where as the second store I worked at had a very hard time keeping to the schedule I provided that worked with my classes.
good,working for Caremark while attending school gave me the hands on experience that I needed to better understand what I was learning in school & allowing me the opportunity to apply it to my day to day work; thus boosting my confidence & solidifying my knowledge of my chosen degree.
good,"see summary.  "
good,"This is your typical coorparaite company and they don't care about their employees and their well beings, they just care about the big business and money."
good,"1.) Great feeling of family among co-workers."
good,"Very organized training program"
good,Working in a pharmacy can be very stressful at times because it does get a little crazy. There are days when we never received a lunch break. The good thing I liked was the training provided to become a pharmacy tech.
good,As a store manager you are in charge of the success and failures of the people and location.  If you execute the basics and display the company's values everyday chances are you will have a profitable store and engaged employees.
good,"typical day at work was working with other employees, customer assistance, cleaning etc). I learned better teamwork skills. Liked working with co workers."
good,Little support for labor.  Trying to keep the labor figure as low as possible.  Supposed to be about customer service but its about labor costs.  I was there a long time ago
good,"Fun workplace but not the best . Management could be better, but team is real friendly and care. Avery day is very busy . Sometimes working overtime on Saturday."
good,"Customer focused service"
good,Need to be more family oriented  and try to help employees strike a good wotk/ life balance so as to become more efficient  and productive.  It will be a win for the comoany
good,"Need more employees to take stress off current employees.  Not enough time to service current customers, having to have customers leave prescriptions in order to fill next day."
good,Been away  13 years removed from company. Typical corporate mentality. Maintain low labor costs while providing good customer service.  Changing management teams and priorities
good,I have worked at many CVS locations and I find the overall experience was great. The only downside I can think of is CVS cutting back hours for all employees.
good,it ' s a good experience to work at CVS . i met a lot of people and made a new relations .CVS is a company have a good managers and good team . this company offer training for their employment in order to improve their skills .
good,Very fast paced environment. Although usually understaffed prescriptions filled.  Worst part of job would be the backlog of refill requests and needing to contact the customers physician for new scripts and working with irate customers
good,I would punch in and I would check in with the manager on duty and find out where they needed me to work. I would go right to that work station and start working If a customer came through the drive thru I would need to go help them and then go back to what I was doing. If a Customer came up to the register's I would need to stop what I was doing and go help them. I would also help by putting  the prescriptions away. CVS was a very busy place to work and it was hard for me to stay there due to people coming in sick all the time.
good,"Classic retail pharmacy work environment...everything you heard is pretty accurate. The most important part is being on the front lines with your fellow coworkers trying to get through the day, the worst part...well you already know this."
good,They are very concerned about protecting and supporting their staff. They provide an excellent benefit package including 5% 401K matching and the company puts free money into a Health Savings account for you to use for you medical deductible.
good,"Typical day at work was filling prescriptions by counting meds and inputting new rxs, billing, customer service, and insurance verification"
good,I started my career at CVS pharmacy working with some really wonderful pharmacist who would challenge me on a daily basis. I learned a lot working in retail and i appreciated all the opportunities they gave me as a starting technician.
good,"Many meetings"
good,I started my career with this company.  It is very fast paced.  The benefits and pay grade have gotten better since I left.  I wish they had better advancement opportunities
good,Retail pharmacy is just not for me. The company was ok but the turnover rate was insanely high. It is not competitive salary wise and most employees are overworked to the extreme.
good,"Fast paced, everyone does their job well.  Pharmacist was very helpful.  The hardest part of the day was when only 2 techs were working and our que was full and the phones were ringing off the hook and you had a line of customers waiting for their medication.  The best part of the day was knowing you helped a customer feel better after handing them their prescriptions."
good,"CVS has good (but not great) benefits, is highly organized, and is an overall nice place to work.  However, it is highly micro-managed and does not give its employees much, if any, autonomy."
good,"I was responsible for 125 location in Nassau and Suffolk Long Island."
good,nothing really bad to say about the enviorment.  I was offered room for advancement.  however there was some cattiness amongst peers but if you steered clear of the trouble then the enviorment was tolerable
good,The atmosphere depends on the store. Get to know other employees before committing to the store. The pharmacy differs from the front store in great strides.
good,This was a warehouse position. Very fast paced. I enjoyed the people and the position most of the time. It was hot in the summer and cold in the winter.
good,This center started off enjoyable then after about 1.5 years it turn more into business focused other than customer focused. CVS is competitive with wage with annual merit raises and quarterly bonuses
good,I liked the job. I started as a cashier and became a supervisor witithin a year. I was pregnant during my time there and my managers and supervisors really considered my child's well-being. I am proud to have worked for this company. The benefits are bomb!
good,"Didn’t last too long, seasonal position is always the worst because you have to end up leaving and then when you have no other experience it’s harder to find a new job.."
good,"It is customer based job. I have to be fast, focusing and multitasking at the same time. I have to make phone calls, to speak with patients and insurance companies."
good,"The flow of the store will help anyone willing to go into the pharmaceutical field to learn a lot about drugs functions, name brand and generic, also dealing with insurance companies."
good,the opportunity to grow and be part of Cvs.  Work as a team and get customers ready to pick up their medication and start heading home without having them to return to pharmacy
good,"Being a pharmacist for cvs can take over your entire life if you let it.   They try to get as much as they can out of each employee.   There is always more and more to do in the course of the day.  In addition to  filling prescriptions,  dealing with insurance companies, dealing with your staff,  being on the phone and helping customers you must leave the pharmacy space to give vaccinations.   There is no down time at all.    Some of the benefits are great and some not so great.   The medical insurance was terrible but the rest of it was fine. I've had so many different managers over the course of my 28 years it "
good,"guidelines are provided to drive pt care but the NP works independently without an MA or CNA. NP is responsible for registering pt, verifying insurance, pt assessment, vitals and collection of payments at the end of the visit."
good,I learned to be a team leader with more than 5 people in charge. I’ve learned to be puntual (on time) to work every day and to work on weekends or holidays
good,"CVS cares more about the scores and metrics than they do about the ethics and customer service aspect of the job. Also, as a technician, I never received recognition and any raises or anything went straight to the Pharmacist even if I did all the work. I was not happy my last 2 years of working"
good,"there was never a sense of belonging there. I was an intern, but no one seemed to know what i should be doing. my schedule was completely random and at their convenience. however the pharmacist herself was lovely to work with when our schedules coincided with each other."
good,"The job itself is something not bad, just a lot to get use to. The management however needs work.  They do not listen to their workers they just seem to brush off the problems."
good,"You can expect to be staffed at a bare minimum at all times. You will learn how to multitask as it won't be an option. It is a typical retail working environment with high stress and the only solution from upper management is to ""get it done"""
good,"I would not recommend CVS Health as an ideal place to work where your career dreams are fulfilled. The only reason I stayed there as long as I did was the offered benefits, and the fact that I started with them while I was in school."
good,its a very relaxed job it tends to get very slow at times but its always something to do. The management depending who your dealing with is pretty fair .
good,Back then they paid little to nothing to work don't know if that changed now but this was the first job to take while on summer break. It's not bad but you do more work than what you are paid for if you're not working behind the Pharmacy walls or in management your not making good money to live off of.
good,"You need to work to exhaustion.  The hours keep getting cut so now you are always short 1 person.  When you have yourself and 2 techs on a busy Monday and a line forms then someone comes into drive through you need to be prepared for all production to stop for an extended period of time.  The 2 registers are going along with the drive through for bursts that can last up to 1/2 hour.  The phone then starts ringing and line forms at drop off.  Why can't you get my prescription done in 3 minutes?  Well because I have two people behind you.  A line forming at drive through because I'm not over there and 3 pharmacy calls that have been waiting for 10 minutes.  As the chorus ""3 pharmacy calls"" chimes once more as if sent from heaven.   Oh and a family of 4 wants flu shots.  There goes the possibility of taking even 3 minutes to inhale a sandwich while getting interrupted 3 times in that 3 minutes. One more person to help and these rushes of doom wouldn't ruin our workflow for an hour or more.  I can't imagine how some of the pharmacists get through their day... Oh I know most of them don't care, that's how."
good,"I wish there was better training of pharmacy interns. Often the pharmacy was too busy so my preceptor didn't have time to teach me. However, awesome people work at CVS."
good,"It was nice to work there. Customers are sometimes rude, but that didn't change my performance. Over there people learn a lot about the medication process, and how to deal with insurances before haning any drugs to the patients."
good,"Face paced, limited staff, constant demands to meet the numbers. unwillingness to help when needed. Company used to be a great place to work, lately it has changed."
good,"typical work day included prescription processing, prescrition verification, patient counseling, vaccinations, correcting insurance claims, inventory control, C2 ordering, patient education (most enjoyable part of the job), pharmacist and technician scheduling"
good,"lots of standing on your feet, repetitious, multi-tasking, employees are friendly, reassigning work as needed, meet goals for the day, trying to make rate,"
good,"At CVS, you are worked hard for little money. Granted depending on the team you are with, your work can be easy or manageable. But, most of the time corporate would severely cut hours, and expect 8hrs of work to be done in a few hours."
good,"It is important to be fast paced and not slack off. People might come in with emergencies so you must respond fast. Very fast-paced, but friendly coworkers."
good,This was a mail order pharmacy. I like to job but the pay was not great. I had to speak with doctor offices and set up Mail orders to customer who receive medicine for different illnesses
good,I would start off by logging into my computer.  After logging I would get ready to take calls.  They were some of the most difficult calls I had to to take in my entire life.  I would feel for some of the people that I would have to talk to because they were bad off.
good,"CVS pharmacy is a large chain pharmacy which exceeds more than 1000 pharmacies in the country. It provides retail, long term care, and specialty pharmacy services."
good,FUN but stressful. They cut hours a lot so the stores are busy with not a lot of workers. the people you work with will determine if you like the job or not
good,It's good experience but a stepping stone in your career.  You gain a vast amount of knowledge but are lucky if you get a 25 cent raise each year.  Rarely do patients take any responsibility regarding their medication.  I don't understand why they can't call their OWN doctor for a new prescription or how they completely run out and then find out they don't have any refills left and are upset with you.  CVS does not appreciate you.  They just give you more responsibility and less of a raise and they wonder why they have high turnover.
good,The management was recently changed and they did not have the required background needed to understand how to run the specific business. They were confused and often asked for basic people to help with things that only management knew.
good,"Stressful environment, Short-staffed, Overworked, Pharmacy is always behind due to being short handed. No work/life balance. Management was not helpful with things."
good,I work in all areas of CVS Warehouse they are a decent company to work for they give you ample sick time and vacation once you earned it pay is decent able to move up and advanced inside of facility
good,I can only speak about the store at which  I worked.   The customers were quite often difficult and demanding.  I experienced a lot of stress working there.
good,"Cvs expects a lot from their employees but does not compensate well for a job well done and meeting their expectations. Standards are high at cvs, but the pay doesn’t equal out for the work you put in."
good,Plenty of training to prepare you for the job.  The only downside is that hours are hard to come by and that it is hard to find the money in the budget despite them hiring new people.
good,"The over all culture is lacking. Company tries to make things more exciting but everything is pretty dull. With a 30 minute lunch, you do not have anytime to regroup from being on the computer all day at a desk."
good,Very helpful and worth the training. I enjoyed every minute of the training. I was given high attention and the upmost respect. I didn't get paid because it was training but still enjoyed the time there.
good,I like who i work with. The work is good. But corporate meddles too much in basic day to day functions in an Orwellian fashion. And they continue to cut hours while raising expectations. This leads to unnecessary stress on the team just to save the company having to pay an extra person per shift.
good,Working here wasn't a bad experience at all. The only reason I quit was because it was too far from home for the hours they were wanting me to work. The job is fast pace and rewarding.
good,"CVS makes a great first job, but after a very short while the work gets  repetitive, although I will say there is always something new to learn when the opportunity is given."
good,"The job is great but hectic and chaotic but well worth it in the long run."
good,they just dont give reviews when promised and the schedule isnt for me anymore. i moved on to a sales position. im happy where i am now just looking to relocate
good,"did data entry alot of times work would run out had to wait for other departments to process their work to have data to enter, management was very easy going"
good,"Address urgent emails."
good,I like the company it's self. They hours are not suitable for me to have a good home life when my husband works normal hours. The benefits seem to be good. I do not use them but they seem decent. Good learning point.
good,Typical work day is busy. Not enough employees so pharmacist sometimes have to support technicians' role. What I learned from working with CVS is time management help make life easier. Work culture at CVS is fair. Employees respect pharmacists most of the time. Company objectives are clearly given to us on a daily basis through emails and conference calls. Hardest part of the job is having to work with someone else that is not motivated. Not enough coaching were done to improve the workplace process and procedures..management part. Most enjoyable part of my day at CVS is the customers and friends at work.
good,"•	Adding Obligation Notes on the CARS System"
good,"this place was just ok to work ad get paid. not great work and style. Don't miss it, glad to be ouf there. not sure that happened to every one there. but i'm out"
good,for the criterion for the first time in years and I have to see how much I wanna was the first time in my last year of the world I trade my own life for my life
good,"Unfortunately I loved my coworkers that i worked with, but management did not mange very well. I felt for the job title we should have been trained way better that what they told us"
good,The staff was very knowledgeable and management were on the ball with regards to customer service and their employees. My coworkers were excellent and together we worked as a team.
good,"Typical day consists of multiple meetings."
good,CVS provides a good working environment and benefits.  They need to provide more opportunities for advancement for technicians to move into other areas and promotion.
good,"Cvs is an okay place to work."
good,"I absolutely loved working at CVS/Pharmacy, the customers and flow was awesome. The customers remembered our name just as we remembered theirs. I got a yearly raise and toward my first year I became shift supervisor, which I was hesitant at first, but after being in that position for a couple months I started to enjoy being a boss position as a leader. Towards my two year, I decided to put my two weeks in due to working two jobs and making the decision to choose one and for personal reasons. The store I was in runs a tight ship, but some things needed to change and I couldn't stand with certain things that were happening. I am sadden that I had to make such a hard decision, but I am so much happier now."
good,On the go from the time you clock into work till the time you leave. Helping customers get in and out with satisfactory/exceptional wait times. Friendly customers service delivered to make each customer feel welcome. Interacting with insurance companies and doctors offices to resolve issue. Inventory management for incoming and outgoing products. Restocking various items from store supplies needed daily to weekly/daily new shipments of medications .
good,"overall a good job , just wished I had more hours. the work was tolerable. facing the store and checking shelf dates while checking customers out. Most enjoyable part was getting recognized for the hard work you do ."
good,"learned a lot of life lessons "
good,"I was excited about going to work every day, work with such loving and caring coworkers!! helped each other if needed also recognized good points when they were done right!!"
good,"it was a nice place to work, little advancement, training was good. hired for other locations, management was good. the customers were freindly, moved around a lot"
good,"I enjoy working at CVS, however they never seem to give their employees the resources to get the job done. Awkward computer systems that slow us down. Lack of enough employees to fully satisfy the customers. Management only seems to care about moving up instead of focusing on their primary goal which is the store they are in. That being said, I enjoy interacting with customers, helping as much as I can, coming together as a team to get the job done."
good,I absolutely love this job. The atmosphere and people are very welcoming and it is easy to learn and grow more about the position and the company.  Great environment
good,"Assist customers with their questions, problems and complaints in person and via phone."
good,"Typical large company in today's work place. The bottom line can overpower patient care, or just get lost.  Again this is pretty much any kind of company now."
good,Great multitasking and teamwork skills are required. What is most important is who you work with. Anything can be achieved if you have a perfect team.
good,Management at the CVS i was located at was not very well. The store manager at the time was not a very good person. He took advantage of the workers and took days off like nothing
good,"Working for CVS has constantly stretched me to to work for goals set for each store and time management skills .There is constant change happening to reach out to more customers with improved and better services and create loyalty. "
good,"CVS was where I started my pharmacy role. I worked there for 7 years and learned most of my pharmacy knowledge from there. However, it was extremely busy and always under staffed"
good,Was a great place to work. Enjoyed my coworkers very much. We made a great team. I just needed more compensation that they could not afford to give me.
good,"Any store manager regardless of tenue should be ready to and able to do every task, as this will be your day to day. Few staff to manage, and all the work falls on your shoulders."
good,I am currently employed with CVS pharmacy. I have been working for them for 7 years as a pharmacist. I started there as a pharmacy service associate. When I got accepted to pharmacy school I worked there as an intern. Now I work there as a pharmacist.
good,"CVS offers its employees a lot of training but does not offer them very good pay. Also, the pay rate from store to store varies considerably so apply to a couple if you can. Management is fair to its employees for the most part"
good,"Typical day at work-never know what skill you will be taking.  Have learned to be flexible because work is unpredicted! Managment tries to work with us to meet our stats that are unfair.  Workplace moral is low due to the company cutting out events, bonus and holding us back from advancing through out company.  The hardest part of job is having to work every holiday and losing family time,..  The greatest thing of my job is no matter how down we get due to our job is the bonds I have have built with my coworkers.  We give ourselves confidence that one day things will get better."
good,"Good company can move up, not sure about pay anymore  When I worked for them it was not a public company or it just became.  I know many of the people I worked with are no longer there"
good,the company as a whole is not bad to work for. I worked in the pharmacy and it is all about following company policy. The pharmacy can be very stressful at times. The only real fault I had is CVS is solely focused on providing the best customer service possible which isnt a bad thing but we needed more staff in order to do this efficiently.
good,"The job requires knowledge at multiple areas of the building and cross training, it is fast paced most days. You are expected to be able to adjust to chaotic situations."
good,"it was a job third shift had few emloyees stock shelves and wait on the few people who would come in on third shift "
good,It was a great experience to work for the pharmacy dept and reimbursement dept. I worked with great people and had the opportunity to train the new employees
good,Most of the people working the floor at CVS are college students. So it makes it an OK place for students to work and still be able to go to school. Its not a place to go work to pay bills like rent and things unless your management.
good,"I was able to practice my field in Pharmacy with under supervision of a Licensed Pharmacist."
good,Constant pressure to ensure that the correct medications go to the correct facilities. Serviced over 3000 residents throughout  Alabama. No-one leaves until the work is done.
good,"Your always working by yourself, but they expect you to do everything that a full staff of six would do, and they never want to compensate you with raises."
good,Stressful environment with a lot of workload placed on technicians.  Great co-workers make for a fun place to be.  Hours of operation require the employee to be flexible
good,this is a job for someone in school u work nomore than 18 hours a week u get no type of insurance at all but it is very easy an easy to learn no paid time off or nothing
good,Each day required more employees to make sure work flow can properly be achieved. When requesting assistance it could not be given due to a budget and refusal of store manager and district manger to provide the help needed to keep things running.
good,The company and it's culture was great but the Management at the Cotton Center location was something to be desired.  But follow employees are a great resource of support.
good,"I have worked for CVS for the last 20 years but they have gotten away from filling prescriptions in a safe way.  Everything is measured from the moment the prescription is dropped off...how long it takes you to answer the phone, how long it takes to enter a waiter, how long it takes to get someone through the drive thru, everything!   CVS harasses customers by phone by making an exorbitant amount of phone calls asking people to pick up their scripts or to fill scripts.  I love the company but running a good pharmacy is no longer good enough according to management."
good,"CVS is not a bad place to work.  Most of the customers are there to get what they are looking for & they leave.  Theft does typically occur from time to time, but it is handled accordingly & professionally."
good,I was happy with CVS many years but it became stressful. The company begin cutting technician hours making it extremely difficult to provide good customer service. When customers are unhappy it becomes very disconcerting and stressful.
good,"Management would critique phone calls that they didn't want to take as an escalation call and then tell you how you should've handled it."
good,I believe that writing a review about a company that I was not invested in is not a correct way to truly provide the value of the company.  Since I was a contractor I believe that this should be taken with a grain of salt.
good,good workplace for career advancement and quick learning. strong ethical company with a corporate culture and structured organization. it is worth it. it will provide you insight into how insurance works and how you can put yourself in the service of patients.
good,"If you are interested in a steady job in healthcare, CVS is an excellent option. The benefits were solid, but compensation across the board is lacking and CVS bleeds talent to competitors because of it. The ability to advance is unfortunately more a matter of who you rather than performance--opportunities are lacking unless you're in Northbrook, the RI offices, Scottsdale, or on the corporate side of Monroeville. That said, my managers were largely excellent and there were plenty of opportunities to refine my skills to go elsewhere. I took advantage of that, but I'm not sure others are aware of their ability to leverage these opportunities."
good,"The setup was that as trucks came in, we would unload them and distribute the goods to the various stores.  If we could finish in 5 or 6 hours, we were paid for 8."
good,"Peak season is welcome season, long hours and busy schedule. very engaging and rewarding, need to think on your feet and come up with solutions when unexpected situations occur"
good,"busy schedule, analyse and trouble shout daily, provide solutions and deliver quickly. Engage multiple business owners and functionalities to provide a plan and execute successfullly"
good,I felt management showed favoritism. It has been quite a while since I worked there so things may have changed. The pace for my position was quite relaxed. The more fast paced jobs had a lower rate of pay.
good,"There have been a lot of changes in the past 2 years after CVS bought Omnicare, Inc. Several departments are now learning how to cross train. This can be a good thing for those desiring more experience in this field."
good,"It was great job as a new NP, however, they continued to cut benefits and increase services.  Working every other weekend became very old and constantly staying late during the busy season is what ultimately led me to leave."
good,"CVS was a good place to work until , people stated to quit and made the work more heavy on the rest of the of the employees . I didn't like being behind on my work it caused me stressed ."
good,"The CVS at which I worked served a great volume of customers, and small mistakes could spoil the transaction.  The drive-thru phone was poor quality.y"
good,"Good job for a ""first job"". The corporation itself expects a lot from their cashiers and employees, but it is a retail job so it obviously would be like that."
good,"Execute day-to-day operations in the pharmacy as they pertain to workflow, production quotas, and deadlines"
good,I have been employed with pharmacy since 2006. Its a fast paced multi tasking friendly work environment. We enter prescriptions for long term patients in Northwest Ohio & the lower parts of Michigan that are in nursing home care.
good,There is a lot of autonomy working with CVS as the sole provider in the clinic. There are also a lot of tasks/assignments  that must be done. The biggest draw back is that everything is on-line. I think the hardest part of the job is working every other weekend
good,Energetic atmosphere dealing with multiple cultures with language barriers.  Interaction with multiple generations that require different levels of communication.
good,"Fast paced work environment. Good experience for anyone interested in healthcare or pharmaceuticals. The job has the possibility of you working multiple positions on the same day, waiting on customers, filling prescriptions, or entering prescriptions into the system."
good,"Long work hours, holidays, weekend, 24/7 operation for clients prescriptions, overrides, new scripts. Working quarters too closed to other employees, difficult at times to hear the client to attended to their needs. Incentives were best improved ribbons, compliments from clients which led to free meals within the work place cafeteria"
good,Good place to work however pays very low for long island. Otherwise it is a good place to work. It seems the billing dept may be moving out of here and would like to start looking for a new job before they lay off again.
good,"I haven't worked here in almost 13 years, but when I did work there the environment was nice and all about the customers. It was a nice stepping stone for me."
good,People aren't very friendly here. I have worked there for 7 months. Don't really know anyone's name that I work with. I'm also an out going person.. Its like to everyone there its only a job to them.
good,Good place to work for a starter. The store manager was understanding and will to work with our schedules. Fun and friendly place to work. Great for part time who is a full time student.
good,"nice place to work for recommended to my friends."
good,As the years went by during my tenure with CVS the corporate environment became excessive. I felt the focus in the pharmacy shifted from customer care to meeting Wall St expectations.
good,The best part is being able to help those in your community. People come in from all walks of life and that is the time to come together and really help everyone to the best of your ability.
good,"this was a college job. pay w, but for a college student it was decent. nothing you can raise a family on. customers has nasty attitudes for the most part"
good,"Good job for employees who work well in fast paced, high volume environment. Management is supportive and helpful. Not enough support staff for work load."
good,"Environment was great, top scale working facility and conditions.  Great place to work for entry level positions. Still had some growing pains in the PFS Phoenix location where i worked."
good,The work environment was busy as soon as the doors were open.  I was the interim manager and I appreciate the hard working members of my staff.  Minute clinic was a great idea but the offices was understaffed as far as PAs or CNP were concerned.  They were always calling out
good,"Complete timely and accurate review of all prescriptions, Pack and ship medications to be mailed to patients, Perform monthly inventory counts, file paperwork, and stock inventory, Successfully adjudicate pharmacy claims. these were a few things i did there."
good,It was a nice environment. They had good benefits. Nice 401k plan. Friendly co-workers. The work wasn't to hard and the hours wasn't bad.  Lunch wasn't long enough
good,"Good location and really nice staff members. Ready to teach you and answer any questions. The only drawback is there is no drive thru so the location is kind of tiny and not busy, which i hated."
good,"Good stepping stone, pays more than some companies in the area. "
good,"A typical day at work includes packing and dispensing, or compounding medications. I especially enjoyed learning how to compound different medications such as, gels, liquids, pastes, and tinctures."
good,salary should be raised. working is challenging which makes perosn fast and multi tasking. provides opportunity to learn multiple things. work culture is excellent.
good,"Overall, ok place to work for but the management team is poor. Communication is lacking and training needs to be upgraded. They are constantly hiring new people because the training is bad."
good,answer the phone and answer questions and date entry and mail out documents and received documents in the mail and help walk ins with the questions and
good,The role of the pharmacist is extremely difficult. It was extremely stressful and the company may not provide sufficient support staff to maintain proper operations.
good,"when I was hired straight out of school, it was the best job available. I loved coming to work at Omnicare, but then cvs acquired us. staff trimming, corner cutting and micromanaging to cut cost became norm. Sad, because the business and patients suffer."
good,"On  a typical day upon arriving will fill anywhere from 400 to 600 prescriptions through out the day. While checking customers out at the front register or at the drive thru. All while answering the phones, typing prescriptions, and calling insurances when needed. If it is a Friday have to put up the truck during it all."
good,"CVS was an okay place to work, but also seems to be very outdated in some ways.  Pay is not that great, and they're somewhat strict.  To much is expected from a Tech and pay is too low.  And the atmosphere just wasn't what I liked."
good,"They are not willing to work with you on anything but offer you flex, pto and floating holidays, to say that you can take your floating holidays when they say take them and half the time flex is never approved. Also that will not just come out and say it but you can never take off on a monday. They will switch your schedule with no warning and have no regard to people having a life outside of this work place. They just expect you to jump when they say jump."
good,"If you can multitask for more than 4 hours in a row, this is the right job for you. Pharmacist manager at my location is the best I have ever worked with. She knows how to assigns the duty to all the techs and being fair to all of them. She is respectful and treats the pharmacy techs as her colleagues, not like her slaves. Working with her has been a nice experience, during which I have learned a lot and grew professionally. Being with CVS for the last 3 years has been really helpful and has taught me the great ability of how to multitask, as well as the trick of prioritizing."
good,CVS was probably the best job I have ever worked at. I had a great group of co workers there and the job was easy and I had a great understanding for my responsibilities.
good,its a good place to work for beginners and can get more experience. i would recommend to more training if you want to go up in company. espcially if the staff is good
good,"a typical day at work is mainly customer service you must always have a smile and ask questions."
good,"When I worked at CVS it was a good work environment. I relocated to Southeast Kansas and they did not have CVS there, so I changed over to Walgreens. I can say that Walgreens was a much better work environment."
good,Great place for younger people who does not know what part of the medical field they would like to work in. Just does not pay what it should due to the amount of work you do.
good,"There was not a lot of room for advancement, and compensation vs. what they expected out of you was not matched.  It is now a requirement to be nationally certified to be a pharmacy technician, and that requires 2 years of school as well as a national test.  Continuing education classes are required and this is all on your dime.  They may help with the college, but they will not compensate for the Test which is not cheap.  They feel they pay their techs, ""enough"" and start the new comers with no experience only a tad short of their seasoned tech's.  Raises are minimal and ""bonuses"" are ""rewarded"" and not much to talk about unless you are a manager."
good,"It's ok.If you need a part-time job. if you're going to school, they wok around your schedule so its flexible. in my experience, they cut hours a lot so though i'm full time i can only get part-time hours and had to get a second job."
good,Good place to start a new career.  Hours change weekly and vary weekly.  Work in all areas of retail in pharmacy  concentrating on friendly customer service.
good,Great team. disorganized district wise. under staffed at times. hourly pay lower than other pharmacies. pharmacy manager was energetic and fun to work with
good,This is a good job with good benefits and pay but requires you to marry into the job to have any chance of advancement. You work a lot of overtime and often weekends. They could also improve on their management and not just put anyone in charge.
good,"Hard for part time workers.  They get no benefits.  There is a significant amount of training required.  The customers can be difficult."
good,"I worked there from the age of 16. I loved the actual pharmacy job, but did not like the cooperate part of CVS. I felt it disconnected the customers and employees."
good,If the management worked better with other employees it would be better. Other than that the company needs to keep an eye on racism in the workplace..
good,"I liked working at a call center. People who called were sweet and just wanted their meds. Unfortunately, if I could not get them ordered for them, things got heated. I was yelled at, cried too and even had someone threaten suicide. Not an easy job."
good,The job isn't hard at all you need to be very detailed oriented and stay on tasks. The days were exteremely long working 12 hours at the 24 hour stores but for the most part it was very relax and easy to work for.
good,"The CVS that I work in is usually VERY busy and stressful because we fill so many prescriptions a day and sometimes don't have enough technicians to get everything done. My team is awesome, we are always helping each other and asking questions to better each other. Time passes by so quick because you're always busy."
good,the workload is hard and the expectation is unrealistic for the staffing we get. It is a fast paced and the surveys we rely on to help with customer service is a lose lose option.
good,"Very nic eto work. nice working environment, students were nice , but the salary wasnt enough . was little challenging and coudent provide enough hours"
good,As a minute clinic representative you are taking calls for the nation so a lot of the patients calling in will be frustrated which can lead to frustrations in the office.  There are team leads in place to assist with calls but they can sometimes be hard to find.
good,Not the best place to work if you have compassion for sick people. They time how long it takes you to answer the phone no matter what the circumstances.
good,Good Starting job. I recommend it for college students and high school students. I would not mind working in the corporate portion of CVS though. Seems like a great job.
good,"Cool place to work, room for advancement. There is new management now so I don't know how it is now. CVS is now owners of the company so things have changed"
good,Working at CVS ensures that you will ALWAYS have something to do. You will be given tasks that need to be completed in a certain time frame and as soon as you finish you will be given more.
good,Dispatcher are terrible. Always meeting new people. As a route driver  its good money.  As a back up driver sometimes get hard because there is no deliveries.
good,I went to school to be a pharmacy technician however I didn't wanted to work on a retail environment. I did learn some stuff working at CVS the only problem was that it was far away from where I live.
good,I was a manager of over 5 years. not a big diff in salary between manager and staff pharmacist but a big diff in the work load. too demanding. never enough support staff.
good,"The company has gone through far too many changes in ownership and additional acquisitions to operate with any consistency.  The general attitude is a false sense of comradery with a back stabbing reality.  This stems from on-site management blaming Corporate and then blaming the teams that they manage when Corporate demands improvement."
good,"Typical day at work  consist of ringing up customers on the register. being friendly with the customers, help  customers to find items, unload truck, and help stock the shelves. I've learned to be customer oriented and be friendly and courteous. I've also learned how to use a register. Management was decent. Not all that great. Hardest part was dealing with different personalities at times and most enjoyable was my co-workers."
good,"Expect a heavy workload on a day to day basis. Will not get out ""on time"" daily. Good team work. Weak management which can cause stress at times to accomplish goals."
good,"It was a different job, I worked there for two years and was promoted twice in that time. The job was very nice as well the people that worked there was very nice and friendly. The store has a very happy family vibe the custorms are great."
good,"Told a specific shift time at interviews. Was told that there would be a set schedule and weekends off. When hired, told that my shift times are going to be 12 hrs. not 8 hrs. Have to work Saturdays if not I would have to quit.  Does not care about you going to school. The pay isn’t good but the benefits seemed good. Good job to have while trying to find a better one."
good,Pharmacy manager is biased and is known to be wishy-washy and moody. A lot of the time employees feel like they are being constantly listened to when they are doing their job. Sometimes I feel like a child being watched by a strict parent. It makes for a stressful environment.
good,"No real issues here, the customers can be an issue but overall if you are working with a great team of people there is little to no issues that you can tackle and overcome as a team."
good,"overall okay place to work. got off at a decent time on 3rd shift, co-workers were easy to work with and job environment wasn't stressful. I would recommend this job"
good,"CVS is a good place to work, I do not have an opinion about CVS to share at this time. Fast paced, good pay, marginal benefits, 12 hour shifts with no lunch break."
good,"If staff was allowed more hours or if they hired more, the workflow would be much better. Problem would be solved by paying techs more or hiring more techs so they boost either quality or quantity of the position instead of following the minimum wage culture that many retail stores have. Great people. but very stressful during peak hours. "
good,Check your machine before you start. Get your plan layout sheet.  Then go to your asign area and begin your work for the day. Load and unload the truck for delivery to the stores.
good,"The best part of working at CVS is meeting new people, the worst part would have to be how valued customer service is. No matter how rude customers get you must ALWAYS leave them with a positive impression."
good,A typical day at cvs is not so typical. You never know who will walk through the door and what frame of mind they're in. So you have to be really empathetic to customers.
good,I have enjoyed my time with the crew I worked with there. The manager had a good work flow and kept us carted for in the work establishment. I enjoyed my time there.
good,I liked working in Marksville but we never had enough help. There were always problems there with management. The store manager did not like to get involved in the business of the pharmacy.  Nevertheless CVS has made a bad name for theirself with most pharmacists.
good,"•       Assisted patients with prescription orders and other pharmacy services"
good,your constantly on your feet and helping clients. the training they give you is great and informative. cvs is quick paced i worked in the pharmacy so it was constantly busy.
good,"Helped my customer service skills , got to meet good people every day , diverse environment . Clean and better problem solving skills . Dealt with customers"
good,It is a very fast paced environment.  The most enjoyable part of the day is a satisfied customer.  The hardest part of the job is learning all of the drugs names brand and generic.
good,"There were some good points about working in CVS: the team consisted of good people, the direct manager was understanding and caring and appreciated hard work. It was a full time job. The upper management cared about PR only, organised senseless PR evens, burdened employees with time-consuming goal setting requiring a lot of paperwork that did not make any sense."
good,"CVS has offered me an amazing experience. My team was great and my pharmacists carried out their roles ideally. However, everything goes dull when something that's supposed to be encouraging and mood lifting transitions into being picture perfect. The reinventing of pharmacy went off to reinventing a monopoly and the customers don't make the job any easier considering it's foreigners yelling without understanding the explanations we give them. Overall CVS has potential to balance out empathy with a heavy workload, but it's not there just yet"
good,Would  still be there if not so fat from home to travel   and was  not ready to  retire worked different kids in the pharmacy packaging  meds for delivery  to nursing homes worked set hours and every other weekend
good,"Training from online school concentrated on knowledge and measuring of products. After a brief OJT training period, expectations were high on completing many other tasks and performing at a high rate of speed. I give thanks and high praise to all the Pharmacists and Technicians that were on duty with me."
good,"Great co-workers"
good,Retail can be very good if staff and bosses are cooperative and understanding.  It is definitely stressful because of constant need to keep up with the metrics and deliver excellent customer service.  My previous management was very nice and understanding so it made work environment bearable.
good,"As a pharm tech you will learn/ pick up things about medication interactions,insurance issues, problem solving, etc. It is really fast paced but you get used to it after a while."
good,was a good place to work as far as duties and customer service. wanted more hours a day and a week. thought they had favoritism in my place of employment.
good,"A fast paced job , however I have enjoyed working there and interacting with customers. Working at CVS helped me to develop better time management skills."
good,Doesn't pay enough for the work that's required. Turn over rate is horrible. Management is okay but can use more training. People from all over the world work in this work place. Nice thing about the job.
good,Lack overall team work.  Pay is horrible never any bonus. Plays favoritism. Work environment is hazardous. There’s no growth for employees. I have missed plenty of lunches just to help keep store afloat
good,Attempting to gain structure - high turnover leads to inconsistent policy application.  Hoping as the facility develops there may be a better approach to retention
good,"One of the more unique settings for a pharmacist, especially a young pharmacist. Interesting people and pharmacy tasks, a lot like working in a warehouse"
good,"Hours are not consistent however, you learn a lot if you are looking to pursue pharmacy as a career. Pay is good if you are entry level, only annual raises."
good,"Good people to work for & with (Emp. and other Asst. Mgrs)Fast-paced and constantly busy/Workload could be heavy @ times (Weekend work)... Good compensation w/ benefits! Also, some very good clientele to work with (both over the phone & in person)."
good,"Would go back.  Great time, friendly environment. Overnights was great.  Wish all former team members the best.  recommend this for all technicians wanting LTC experience"
good,This is an extremely busy company and the work hours are later in the day.  But overall this is a good company to work for if you do not mind the later hours.
good,"Went to work to be with people . After 34 years it seemed they would keepshort handing us just so they could buy another store."
good,"Busy, enjoyable, some stressful days, great team that I worked with.  I worked with great pharmacists and a great group of techs.  Lead tech was very challenging especially when they started cutting hours."
good,"I've worked in 4-6 different locations in CA, and it depends on if the store is high volume or not. If the location is extremely high volume, it can be frustrating with the work load and trying to cater to the patients needs, however the weight mostly falls on the pharmacy manager. If the store is low volume, everything is done and it can be boring."
good,Overall a good place to work.  Benefits offered to employees. Continued education offered. Lively work environment. Good vacation benefit first day on job.
good,"Nice Facility, nice location, easy access to area."
good,I have work for CVS 6 years and 5 months. during those period it was a stressful job. because it was short staff and more work and little pay. it affected my health overrall
good,"99 % of the IT resources are Indians and they always talk in their native language whether or not there are others around them or not. People with power (full-timers) abuse their power. Full-time senior managers love to get contractors get fired and they really enjoy when their actions (incorrect negative feedback to other managers) impact an employees livelihood negatively. Contractors are treated like second class citizens. Next to every contractor's email ID or Instant message chat (skype) had - ""Contractor"" term associated. This is an invitation to arrogant full-time senior managers to harass the contract resources."
good,Not really much to say as a stock clerk. I really enjoyed meeting new and regular customers my shift leader at the time was a great guy loved working with him.
good,A typical day at CVS consists of working hard and quickly as it is a high volume retail pharmacy. Strong emphasis on customer service and attention to detail.
good,"te only thing I didn;t like about it was the lack of recognition for the position in which i held, only reason they did with everyone else, but overall its a ok job"
good,"Good benefits.  Not enough hours for part time employees.  Fun job, but hard work.  I enjoyed the years I was at CVS.  Great for students and moms looking for part time work."
good,Company was fair and just. Friendly environment to be around. Management was fair and tried to work with you on many occasion to try to accomadate your needs.
good,Mediocre skills learned that hadn't already been obtained. Friendly and helpful staff. Most customers grow impatient with the insurance billing and prior authorizations that are required to release the prescription to the patient.
good,"Fast-paced environment, constant incoming calls, lots of training and paperwork, often dealing with irate customers, shift bids by seniority, and great pay and benefits."
good,"Well it is not alot to say.  They trained you very well.  The trainer was awesome."
good,"Most of the day was spent on your feet. you'll get all the workout that you need working here"
good,Working at CVS is challenging but interesting. You learn new things everyday. You get to meet nice customers and helping them everyday is a plus. It gives an opportunity to interact with customers.
good,A regular day includes customers bringing and dropping off prescriptions. Contacting insurances and doctors offices. Its offers great on the job training. Hardest part is dealing with upset customers when things are out of your control. Meeting new people is the fun part of the job.
good,Company has little regard for its employees. Employees are all extremely stressed out and overworked.  Company never thanks you for your efforts but is always asking more and more and more.
good,"very demanding, fast paced work environment with not enough hours budgeted for staffing makes the place exhausting and burns out even the best of employees. "
good,"This company has a lot of work. The work is fast paced and projects can be very demanding.  The company is always merging with other PBMs, which means constant layoffs."
good,Work in an extremely fast paced environment having to constantly multi-task to keep up with work-flow.  Deal with many customers at time who are not feeling well and need a lot of help.
good,Training class was crammed into 2 weeks for what should have been 4 weeks of training. It cutting corners like this that makes for bad business. When I got onto the production floor .. I felt completely helpless and didn't know what to do. I would have to call over the supervisors to help me ..
good,CVS Health was a great learning experience to kick start a career in Pharmacy. You will receive extensive insight with insurance and medication filling. You will also learn a great deal about inventory. Best wishes!
good,Lots of hard work. Busy with customers getting their prescriptions through their insurances. Enjoyable job that I went to school for. Worked here while going to school.
good,Great benefits. Management provides excellent care to their employees. Workplace is very comfortable. hardest part of the job is driving doing delivery for patients around the valley. most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team.
good,"If the higher ups would give more help and back up their employees the job would be more manageable. Between being short on hours and the problems that come from working in a pharmacy, it's very easy to get burnt out. But you make a lot more starting pay than anywhere else."
good,"There's no reason to require writing this review. The job was a smooth fast-paced job where you would have to count and fill prescriptions, work RTS and put in prescriptions into the system."
good,"Their system for staffing is extremely construed. They are always very understaffed, by ways of their process for determining hours worked in a store. This causes extreme stress for the people that are working at the time. Their training however, is very thorough."
good,"CVS Pharmacy is a company that is very fast-paced. You have to be able to keep up with your pharmacist, register, drive-thru, and phone calls, as well as fill prescriptions."
good,"High volume store, very stressful, management  was mostly concerned about store  metrics than  service to patients. Conflict resolutions were not addressed properly, instead they  just made decisions base  of numbers."
good,I loved my associates.  We all worked hard at a fast paced level.  it was a 24 hour store so work never really slowed down.  we were often short staffed because on budget restraints an the patients recognized this and were not happy about it.
good,The job was ok. They start you off at a good rate pay but then they give cents raises. The workplace is fast paced. You standing up for like 8 1/2 hours.
good,Great place to work .  The environment was very friendly with  helpful employees . I would recommend this place of employment to other individuals . The management was very approachable and helpful/
good,"I was assigned to cover a district that began 75 miles from my home. I crossed 4 other districts to get to mine. I spent 6 hrs a day in a car!"
good,I enjoyed working here. The team would do potlucks and happy hours together a lot and even commute into the office on their work from home days to attend the events. Everyone who works here works a lot of very long and hard hours.
good,CVS is an okay place to work; it's pretty average. I wouldn't recommend it if you cannot stand on your feet for an entire shift. They are one of the lowest paying pharmacies for pharmacy technicians as well.
good,if you ready to work hard this is for you. It was ok. You should be on point dont fall asleep. Stay focused. Don't play or talk too loud. you can do it.
good,"I would usually come in to the pharmacy and work an average of 8 hours, I had various friends in the office whom i shared my days with. I was always busy during the day so the day would go by fast. Everyday I would learn a new area."
good,Very corporate in a sense that they care a lot about scores and meeting numbers.  Very fine people to work with and great staff.  Customers are also friendly.  Very fast-paced and can be over-whelming at times.  Very good learning experience.
good,I leaned a lot of functionalities and technical things which helps me to improve my confidence and i need a change because the life is very stressfull over here
good,"CVS is a good company to work for, for as benefits, and working with the customers. Coming in at 745, doing office work for 2 hours, cycle count and quick pick while helping the customer's with their needs.Make end caps or full and set with signs and products."
good,"For the amount of work load and stress we deal with and complications with our registers, computers, and phones. Especially handling peoples confidential information and being responsible of how someone can maintain their health we should for sure get paid more than just above minimum wage."
good,"I liked working for CVS as the culture was relaxed and day to day was easy to deal with.  It is a nice job to start out at, but the pay is not anything to brag about and the hours were slim.  It is more of a high school job.  I was a cashier."
good,Very Productive  to work here. Very friend coworkers here. No problems at all. Very helpful when asked for help you will get help. No problems with doctors at all
good,Very stressful and most of the customers are very rude. Very demanding place to work and you can hardly get your lunch breaks in. Some pharmacist don't want to help out especially on the weekend.
good,"it was my first part time job, I learned a lot but eventually there was no more to learn. time goes by fast because its so busy but its a mentally unrewarding job in my opinion."
good,"It all just depends on what you're looking for. If a job where there is absolutely no room to grow is what you're looking for, CVS is for you! The chances of moving up in this company are slim to none and the only way to make a livable wage is be in upper management. Pharmacy and front store included. Employees who have devoted 15+ years of their time to this company find themselves barely makes $15 an hour. This job is good for High School teenagers looking for money to blow. No career advancement opportunities are available and when/if they do become available, the pay makes it barely worth it."
good,very fast paced workplace they pay low but its worth it because you get licensed as a pharmacy technition with out gong to school and taking out loans
good,My regular schedule was 6 to 8 hours a day on average.  It can be stressful with the lack of help.  Decided to seek other employment to learn new things and stretch my knowledge.
good,"Good place to start if you are a newly certified pharmacy technician as you will immediately start performing a variety of tasks and learn.  But once you have experience, they will not pay you for it.  No advancement opportunities.  Receive low raises despite excellent evaluations."
good,Put my headset on and start picking order. The hardest part was having to always keep moving. I liked not having to talk to people all the time. I enjoyed working there
good,This company has a wide range of technology which gives great opportunity to learn and grow in the Information Technology arena. There is no lack of opportunity to contribute to the systems area.
good,"Overall working here has been OK, but it can sometimes feel like corporate treats us like children. Most recently, rigid guidelines have been put in place for how our desks can be set up, limiting not only personal items to one per person but also restricting work aids."
good,"filling medications for customers"
good,"Very fast-paced environment filling prescriptions, answering phones, operating registers."
good,"In a little room by yourself. Not given the opportunity to work 40 hours per week. Capped at 60 hours, Have to clean clinic and take out trash each day. Lack of support."
good,A typical day is doing starts off with looking at a piece of paper to see where your stationed for the day. I did not learn much from this place as its a warehouse. Management is constantly changing and allowed to get away with whatever they want.
good,Stressful work environment. Not a very supportive staff for team involvement. During the time I was there the entire company was forced to take a pay cut.
good,"Decent pay, room for advancement, only down fall I would say is shift bidding and mandatory OT. Night and evening managers are alot more laid back than morning supervisors"
good,It so much workload and you dont get paid as much. Although they are flexible with my schedule I wish they would give more focus on salary. Other than that it is very hectic! I never had any problems with my coworkers.
good,Over all a good place to work. It can get busy at times. Keep your stats good and its pretty smooth sailing 😃. Keep your stats good cause your shift and bonuses are based on stats.
good,Must be very people oriented to work in a retail pharmacy.  People don't always understand every aspect of prescription filling and insurance it gets billed to.  Specifically older people get confused very easily about billing and you need the patience to explain things to them
good,nothing good I can say about this company and would not work there again and was just a number and not an employee and feel mislead in job description
good,Fast paced and stressful at times.  I learned a lot about medications.  The workplace culture was not nice.  Colleagues would scream at each other.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were assisting the patient with treatment that was going to benefit their health situation.
good,"This job is a good transition job for me. I was able to get hired because of my retail experience but then was able to become a pharmacy technician. However the stress of retail is combined with the stress of pharmacy as well. I desire a different setting for the future. The only way I will get my desired compensation at CVS is by staying with the company and waiting for a yearly raise, which is not helpful to my current financial responsibilities."
good,"You are expected to learn a lot of information in a short amount of time and you have to answer phone calls and end them within 2 minutes. Because you are working for an insurance company, you will deal with rude callers and doctors. I did not have a positive experience with this company."
good,Its not always what you know but who you know .Tenure doesn't mean anything and hard work can be overlooked due to new management . Most of the employees are really nice though.
good,Overall I like CVS. A typical day consists of pulling tags and then replacing them with the proper ones. Keeping the store front faced and debri free. Making sure the customers are happy
good,CVS is a competitive company. You have to be able to pick products in a timely fashion. The environment itself is pretty laid back as long as the work is done.
good,"management didn't communicate as they should have, and associates are treated poorly in my opinion. Associates are not rewarded as they should be for accomplishments."
good,"Needed to hire more employees, they also had a rat issue which they refused to properly take care of which made the work environment unhealthy and unappealing."
good,"it was fine, i worked what i had to do. managers were fine. i was behind the register mostly. the hardest was stocking the shelves while being behind the register."
good,"I like working for CVS, my managers are excellent.  I have been working for CVS pharmacy for approximately 2 years. The work environment it is very stressful due to lack of short staff.  It gets very busy and difficult to help customers in a manner that they deserve."
good,Good place to work for pharmacy experience but slow job advancement. Average management and average benefits. Tough application online for jobs at CVS.  Also takes a long time for your application to be approved.
good,"Helping general and pharmacy customers on structured policy and procedures. Friendly environment but, sometime its difficult to render desired customer service because of limited resources."
good,great for experience the workers are very helpful and friendly kind and patient while your training it has different departments so you can learn different techniques of pharmacy technician duties
good,"I enjoy the the challenge of learning different insurances policies and criteria. I communicate with insurance representatives and doctor's offices personnel on a daily basis, which is also something that I enjoy."
good,wonderful environment and constant continuing education to keep up with what is happening. The hardest part of the job back then was low patients turnout as the site had just opened its doors to the public.
good,"typical day at work with assistimg customers , management could be better , best part of job was helping members better understand and explore all options ,,,  when I first came into caremark   it  was  a very good place to work ..  but company seem over thr years to care less about welfare of their employees"
good,We knew what our hours were after training and we had talks with our supervisors every month to see how we were doing. We were definitely rewarded for all positive feedback.
good,manager sucks aot   I always get yelled at I lieterally got yelled at for working when we were about to close  I don't understand it at all I always get smack from my manager for just doing what I'm doing and it is annoying  but overall it is a good place to get expersince with talking to people and working a register not all locations are like this.
good,"Personally, working at cvs was fairly simple for me. I practically did what i wanted due to my position so the manager did not hassle me at all for anything. The only problem i has was that sometimes the workload would be too much for and since my store was 24 hours i would have to be there really early for my shift.They did change managers too often and they all try to change the store which made it sometimes difficult"
good,"I have been with Coram Healthcare for 20 years, I have learned a lot and been through many changes, however I feel its time to move on, nothing lasts forever."
good,"Big company,Job security, lots of locations, easy to relocate, diversified business interest, growing, good salary, comes with benefits, immunisation,"
good,"Between downsizing and layoffs I have managed to hang in here for 23 years and I hope to remain here until I retire. I have worked in several different departments, moving around the company as needs changed. Overall satisfied with company as a whole."
good,"Don't work overnight  Tough schedule,   The work is repetitive and the potential to get robbed is there.  The late night customers were funny.  We sold cigarettes then and the smokers came in"
good,Other then it being a quite stressful work environment management was always very supportive and willing to work with you with anything you needed. loved the people i work with
good,The work was easy but some of the customers were not very nice and it made it difficult at times.The staff and other colleagues were very nice yo work with.
good,"I was a contract employee through a temp agency.  I love meeting people and being a part of a great team.  Team work is so vital in any workplace, people were willing to help you when needed.  I was released from my contract when I became lowly sick with the flu."
good,"overall, great learning curve/opportunity which opened my eyes to realize how valuable my skill set really is. Overworked and underpaid unless you walking into a salary-based situation, and that would only be presented to the pharamacists."
good,"About average amount of work needing to get done"
good,"Fast-paced environment. "
good,"Boring, repetitive, unrewarding place to work. My work day consists of calling elderly and tell them that their family owned pharmacy, that they've been with for decades, has been taken over by CVS."
good,It almost kind of depends on where and what location that you are employed at. Working at one and then visiting others made me realize that my store was poorly managed.
good,"I haven't worked here in 10 plus years, my review is not relevant at this time. I am sure things have changed, as well as management. No need for a 10 year old review"
good,"answer calls for 8 hrs a day. "
good,"my typical day would start with a staff meeting, where we would learn about our quotas. Then its to my desk to begin my case load. I learned a great deal about medical collections and how hard it is to get the state of California to pay patient's bills. (Medi-Cal). Co-workers kept the workplace fun with theme days and potlucks. The hardest part of my job is when I couldn't get a claim paid out no matter how many times I've submitted it. Potlucks were the most enjoyable for me."
good,"Its a fun place to work great customers high paced environment ,I've  learned how to deal with all kinds of people . Also learned great management skills  . Just overall great  learning experience ."
good,"Verify customer prescription orders via phone and fax."
good,"They work you 8-10 hrs a day with only a 30 minute break. The schedule is different every week with only a 2 day notice before the next week. Because they train you, the pay is one of the lowest for a pharmacy tech position.  Management will throw you under the bus in a heart beat in order to please a customer, Then laugh about it later. Overall, I'm appreciative to CVS for giving me experience in a high volume pharmacy, but for nothing else."
good,It was one of those 24 hour store and the store filled about 600 prescriptions per day. Time management is extremely important to keep customers and empoyees relatively satisfied. no lunch or dinner breaks for pharmacist.
good,"This was a temporary job. I stocked shelves, unloaded the trucks and boxes, labeled items and cleaned the stock room. Made sure everything was in order."
good,"very fun and productive a bit slow to work at and not many customers. the dm is kind of rude but overall its an okay job. "
good,Allowed to work from home and manage 2 departments in 2 pharmacies. Handle multiple problems and making people accountable for work flow process. Able to meet many customers on a weekly basis.
good,"I've received fair scheduling and assistance in achieving the training I need to do my job well and competently. However, I don't agree with the way certain policies and guidelines are carried out."
good,"Being on the phone all day can be frustrating in itself, but depending on your supervisor your day can be longer than it needs to be, great workers here"
good,It can be stressful as it is retail. Overall it is a good company to work for Fortune#7 company. Has good benefits. Have to be good at multi-tasking. Reasonable pay.
good,It was organized chaos.  Very competitive and chaotic at times.  they required more of the staff at times and over worked some more than others.  i hope it has since gotten better since i left the company.
good,"Managers say one thing, then won't stand their ground when division directors step in. Too many questions and requirements of customers at checkout. Very stressful. Communication from corporate to cashier level is spotty."
good,Not a bad place to work at but certainly not the best place. The management constantly changes and often times the employees were in a game of whether or not who was their favorite.
good,very nice coworkers. As a big entity people are more professional and less friendly. It is very fast pace work environment. many people quite or don't show.
good,"CVS was a great company to work for, I can say I will miss it very much, and I loved wearing scrubs but they weren't as comfortable as they could be...."
good,I was guaranteed my 40 hours and some overtime they also offer us sick time pay vacation employee discount and we also received bonuses quarterly. I wish they would have offered to work at home
good,"the interface of the system was outdated and it took forever to check patients out. overall, environment was okay but there was not a clear sense of workflow. senior techs would always go to back and avoid dealing with customers."
good,High pace lots of moving parts .  learn to work with a union based work force.  Adapt to contract changes but ultimately  continue to bring diversity to work force and culture.
good,"CVS is a face paced company that comes with a lot of stress. The one thing the company has going is job security. Even during the recession, the company did not have any layoffs."
good,The store was short staffed due to upper management leading to poor working hours and frustrated customers. Co-workers create a friendly environment and compensation is good.
good,14 hour days- poor management and district managers- workplace culture is awful- stressful days- not well staffed- lots of call ins and you get calls on your days off
good,Mi experiencia en CVS fue regular porque habia mucho estres en el trabajo a causa de los horarios que debiamos de cumplir y la responsabilidad que implica el trabajo que se realizaba.
good,"Location was great.  coworkers were easy to get a long with.  Team morale was based solely on my coworkers.  Extensive knowledge in working in a Specialty Pharmacy both as a Clinical Support Specialist and Pharmacy Technician.  Workplace was diversified.  "
good,This was a job. Not a career. You will never get paid what your worth because it always about the bottom dollar with store managers or district managers.
good,"We are over worked, underpaid, and get no breaks. But, it is an interesting job. Takes a lot of patience and compassion to deal with what techs deal with daily in retail pharmacy."
good,"Teaches one to be adaptable, multitask, and learn new skills.  Here one learns to go with the flow, roll with the punches, and just focus on the job itself."
good,"This would be a great place to work if the manager were trained on how to deal with people.  Stress level was high, but the benfits were good. Paid time off"
good,"Life at CVS was not to pleasing. You are needed only during Peak time of the season. Example, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, valentines etc. Was the season is over they cut back on their schedules."
good,"I did enjoy working for them as they always have new challenges, but you must be prepared for changes in the market. You would learn a new program and master it then there was another one that came out. "
good,I left CVS to go to Walgreens. they low balled me on my raise after I became certified. its a good place for someone who is just starting in the field to work at. very slow paced however still stressful. little chances of moving up in management unless prior experience is had (10+ years). they cap their techs at $15.00 per hour. dealing with the benefits program is near impossible. they do not keep promises to their employees and this is the main reason I left.
good,Great job with benefits. Only get 30 min breaks for 8 or 9 hour shift. Long periods of standing. Unfair scheduling. My father passed away they did nothing. They don't do anything for certain people's bday. My niece got married I asked off 2 months in advance. I had to work another weekend to make up for taking my vacation during my weekend to work.
good,Typical retail. 50+ hours a week but very manageable. Over the years the workload has grown. Dc area store have lost 40%+ of their hours over the last 6 years. having the right people is key.
good,"productivity"
good,At my time at CVS Warehouse I learned a ton of skills warehouse skills. Everything from stocking to taking inventory on an everyday basis. There was poor management all throughout the warehouse.
good,"need to work fast,to be team player,have to switch to different spot,"
good,"At the CVS I worked at, it was VERY fast paced. Most CVS'S aren't as busy. Too many people calling in and would often be severely short handed. I became accustomed to it."
good,"The high call volume helps the day go by quicker. Depending on which assignment they give you make sure to pay attention in training especially about what tier a medication is on and understanding deductibles etc The majority of the managers are females and they do play favorites. If you want to go in early like 6am-730am your manager may be a lady named Loretta Thompson she has been there for years and doesn't give you advancement opportunities and tends to favor the male workers. She also does a poor job of working with you and will forget something so make sure you keep track of everything by email or in writing. Annette is another morning manager 7am-9am, she is really cool, but she will fire you on the spot even if its the 1st time you mess up, just because she wont tolerate anything so heads up on that. Manager Conrad 10am-12 is cool he definitely works with you and is understanding and has your best interest at heart and he is equal with everyone. They also do schedule changes, so make sure attendance, your call quality is good cause when it comes time to pick what schedules you rate from one thru ten...you and your neighbor may be competing for the same schedule and days off ..."
good,CVS Caremark is a fair employer with career growth options.  A good place to begin a career with aspirations to advance within given field. Company is loyal to it's employees.
good,There are good days and there are extremely stressful days. Pay is decent if you can handle the stress. Hardest part for me has been high volume of inbound phone calls and having to answer to sales reps who are not always easy to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job has been the people I work with. I have met some great people working here and they are what get you through the bad days.
good,Good place to work as an intern or if you have no job at all.  No real growth potential in many of the positions.  You may have to work out of different stores to find the environment that suits you.
good,"I loved worked as a technician, but I would not return to CVS. They pay less, over work employees, no raises, and have poor management. The job itself helped me grow as a person and as a technician, but I hated being over-worked and having to do 2 peoples worth of tasks while others aren't doing anything on the side."
good,"Customer based care and management."
good,its retail management and employee turn around pay was terrible hours were retail nights weekends holidays if you like retail then ok not bad. Great customers that's what I miss
good,"great place to work"
good,Your days will be determined by how your store manager feels about you. And if you have a good store manager chances are they will be transferred out of your store within the year. There is no consistency with CVS.
good,"in this place you have to watch your back and be careful who you talk"
good,I was a technician here for a few months.  It was a quick paced environment.  They supplied technicians with a lot of classroom training and then online computer modules.
good,"the best part about this job was helping the patients get their medications and appealing those so they did "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, fast pace, and sometimes stressful. Us technicians do more work than is expected of us to help manage the pharmacy and help out the pharmacists as much as possible. Management is never straight forward with rules and regulations and will very depending on the employee; this also includes tasks that should get done around the pharmacy. Breaks are optional and most of the time not expected to take considering how busy the store is. I love working with the people and helping them which is the most enjoyable part of the job. I have learned a lot within the 3 years working here which i am most grateful."
good,there were many days when I went to work you would stock shelves all day long when the truck came in or pull up merchandise constantly. Good luck with this job if you decide to take it.
good,"Corporate keeps adding to what you have to do, with not adding any more staff to help.  People say it can be done, ideal yes, reality not.  Management does not care to help."
good,"It depends on where you work and who is your manager. Some places the people are lazy and dont do anything so you would have to do it yourself. Some mangers are cool but some are ""do everything by the books"" kind of people. Dont give you enough hours to finish something from the district managers"
good,"Good place to start for a new pharmacy technician. You will learn a lot about retail structure, HIPAA laws, fraud & waste mgmt Customers are great too"
good,"Filled and prepacked orders although felt that I was not using my knowledge I had learned as pharmacy technician to the best of my ability. Still worked with great people, was just looking for something different."
good,A typical day at work was mostly fast pace and we were always short handed because they didn't give us enough hours. Management was a little iffy but okay for the most part. There were some problems among the employees but nothing major. The hardest part of the job was the customers who had attitudes with us for no good reason. The most enjoyable part of the job was the way the time flew by because of the pace of the store.
good,Helping customers order their prescriptions and reviewing their coverage plans was the bulk of the work.  Very fast pace.  There is a lot of training for insurance coverage.
good,Very busy retail setting.  Computer system helpful.  Expected to multitask constantly.  Slowly cutting technician help to save money. Very mindful of KPI's over everything else.
good,"A typical work day includes greeting customers as they walk into the store and asking them if there is anything they need help finding. I also check people out at the register, stalk items on the shelves that have come in from the truck, organize shelves, do planograms, etc. From this job in particular, I have learned to work with someone that is extremely difficult to work/get along with. Management does everything in their power to work with the employees on their schedules. The workplace has a variety of different people. The hardest part of the job is working with one employee. The most enjoyable part of this job has been getting to know the customers as we get some of the same people in all the time."
good,Co-workers made the job a lot better and the work is really easy. The worst part would be dealing with unreasonable customers but that's a rare occasion.
good,"arbitrary hour cuts affect personnel, these cuts are implemented from the corporate office"
good,"I enjoyed working at CVS and all the projects I have handled. The reason I left is I could not handle the politics within the team and the pressure from the management. If I get another opportunity with a different team, I will be happy to take the role."
good,Ok the employees in pleasant valley were not very nice to new employees though. There was little is any training. It was not looked at highly to ask questions which was very unfair for new employees.
good,all you deal with is old people and sick people. its very fast paced and stressful. pay is alright for a young kid. cant really move up unless you go to college.
good,"All calls are monitored and typically smooth sailing. This review is required I don't know why, a job is a job in this case. I'm just looking to pick up some part time work on the side."
good,"I loved working in the fast paced environment, always working against the clock. I did not enjoy the constant pressure from cooperate to hit certain numbers. They did not seem to care about the patients, more about hitting numbers that made the company look good."
good,"CVS used to truly care about their  employees. It was a fun place to work. That changed in 2008 during the Great Recession."
good,"When I worked here we were usually understaffed, but I had a great lead pharmacy technician who trained me and always made sure his team was doing okay despite the constant flow of customers."
good,Working at CVS/Pharmacy is a good experience. There is a lot to do so you can learn a lot from day to day. My team is amazing. They make it fun and enjoyable to work. Hardest part of the job is sometimes we do not have enough employees working so it can get a little overwhelming.
good,I didn't like the manager but overall an okay working environment. MY coworkers were friendly and I made the best out of each day. Interacting with different people and learn new things everyday
good,"Learning experiences, great unit meeting, always stay updated with policy and procedures."
good,"- Provide comprehensive patient care to customers."
good,I had a short Spencerian working there. i did not know my co-workers that well. i had a great boss and  a great team. the would help them whenever i needed help.
good,"Good company need to be management wise need to be more train to be in those rolls, otherwise not complaint job work and life balance.   and job culture is on point."
good,"There is so much to learn. You get the opportunity to resolve insurance claims, catch interactions, and help customers find OTC items. Being a part of the local community, you'll know your customers by name."
good,"Not recommended for your first job experience. Expect hard work with little reward. Company is slow to train and promote, but quick to expect results when you are promoted. If you are determined and willing to teach yourself then this is an excellent company. Excellent customer service skills are a must, and being detail oriented when it comes to cleanliness and money-handling are desired."
good,"My experience working at CVS had it's pros and cons. Pros, I met some amazing colleagues across the board. Teammates really support one another and like to see each other succeed. Management can use some improvement. There are good supportive managers, but there are others who seem to set their employees up to fail instead of to be successful."
good,"Since losing the ability to accept tricare insurance, the company has gone from a people company to a company that is only concerned about the bottom line.   The company has slashed payroll, cutting store to run on not enough hours, at times there is only one person in the front part of the store.  Thus making it almost impossible to give the kind of customer service that our customers have be come accustom to.  They pay the salary manager for 45 hours per week but, the average work week is around 60 hours, if you want to get everything done.  I have been in retail for over 25 years and I know about how to make a profit and give great customer service, but every month something come new comes out which adds to an already over tasked work week and it has just become almost unbearable to work for CVS"
good,I would not recommend a job especially if you want a challenge very easy job but to be honest boring... the pay though was really good and they also have an awesome café with reasonable priced foods and a gym pretty cool
good,"Its fast paced, customers are rude, coworkers are not very helpful aside from a few. Always some type of negative energy. Bigger bosses are rude as well"
good,it was stressful because most of the time if not everyday there was only two employees in the front of the store and when the person who was running the cash register needed help the shift supervisor was noplace to be found or was on break and couldnt be bothered.
good,"The pharmacist was suppose to be in charge of the pharmacy.  He was not because of the techs that thought they were in charge."
good,"The 18 years at Cvs, I grew with the company and adapted to all the positive changes the company  rolled out over the years. Customer service was our top priority, and community involvement was what kept me there for  my duration. I had a great career with Cvs. I'm looking forward to exploring other options."
good,"Was in charge of 25 associates.  Was in charge of completing planograms for the store, customer service, unloading and packing out 2 trucks per week, completing vendor orders, completing store orders."
good,"Over the years at Omnicare I learned so much. I was 18 when I started. I made many new friends, learned so much about customer service, the medical field, and one very important thing I learned is compassion towards others. I was a manager, and then I was just an ordinary medical records technician. My choice to gain even more knowledge within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was my happy customers, and the hardest part of the job was knowing that the advancements within the company were almost impossible."
good,"very interactive and customer friendly job.  It's extremely repetitive, so it does get boring. The employees were very sweet. And they do provide lots of help."
good,I was only a pharmacy intern during my course of employment here but I still quickly noticed the stress day in and day out and quickly realized that this would not be an ideal place to practice my career after 8 years of schooling.
good,"this is a good company to work for, its laid back and chill. Decent pay, some of the supervisors are cool. Decent hours, not always fair on how they set schedules."
good,CVS is gives raises once a year. I've heard the standard raise for cashiers and pharmacy techs is generally between 15-25 cent a year. I got 21 cent. I've been working since I was 15. This is the lowest and longest time to get a raise I've ever had in my life.
good,"This job is very stressful and fast paced. The benefits are great but the job itself is not fun. The hours don't work for a person with a family, and its very busy."
good,"Its an easy job, you have all day to do your chores and just stock up anything needed to be done. truck days are okay and just deal with customers and their needs."
good,"Great company and some great people I worked with. Would go back if offered another opty. "
good,"Not a bad place overall, a bit utilitarian employees are more of a number than a person. They need to approach their employees as though they mattered more."
good,I would say I learned a lot working for this company when it comes to HIPAA and Medicare. The job was stressful at times and they were very strict on stats but it was a very good job to work at and get insurance experience
good,I worked at the store for almost 2 years. I liked the people I worked with. They helpful and friendly. Its a fast paced environment and requires you to be focused and energetic
good,"A typical day at Caremark consisted of taking calls from medical doctors to obtain patient information for medication clearance. I learned some additional medical terminology that I was not familiar with, and some of the procedures for medical doctor's gaining prescription clearance. The hardest part of the job was the continued repetition of having to obtain permission for clearance of information. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow employees."
good,"Calls are inbound.  I helped csr with questions they could not answer, took over call if it became escalated.  Management heled you reach your potential.  Work culture was good but sometimes stressful.  The hardest part of job was when you had to tell customer you could not assist them.  When things went well for customer and call ended with a satisfied customer."
good,"It's a job. There have been many company mergers, and I've seen many employee and mangers come and go.  The turnover is unreal and the majority of the people still employed have been with the company over 10-15 years, and are comfortable."
good,Do not assign enough hours to work since I am on a fixed income and need a certain amount to provide me a decent lifestyle. People I work with are great and have no objections about working with or under them.
good,I transferred from Cvs Retail to Omincare and it took 2weeks to get on the floor.I love the staff everyone is/ was very helpful with on the job training.Pharmacy experience is a most.
good,Not a bad job to start at. Set schedules. Assigned duties that are easy to complete. Cash handling required. Customer service very important. Good experience overall
good,"Pay is okay, and advancement is possible if you are a man.Changes are made all the time.  High Turnover rate.........................................."
good,"CVS Pharmacy was a good stepping stone to make money, build experience, and to possibly work your way to management if that's what you are looking for. I was 18 at the time."
good,Long hours and shifts.  Sometimes no lunch break for 12 hours shift.  Very busy work environment with little schedule support.  Management very unsupportive.
good,"You always had a task and it often varied from data entry, to inventory, cash register. Always able to be productive. Management focused a lot on numbers as well."
good,good benefits. Very good management and process. Ensures employee conformance to established policies and practices. it was a stressful job. overall work culture is good
good,There really isn't much to say regarding being a pharmacist with CVS.  The experience of being a retail pharmacist is fairly standard regardless of where you are or who you work for.  Expect to be worked to the bone for little to no appreciation from either patients or supervisors.  Strong benefits and pay do help.
good,"Cvs hires into a union, which means the store you work for has no control over pay or raises. You start out at a very minimal hourly rate which is increased slowly every 6 months. Working for a company that has affiliations with a health care company means very good insurance!"
good,Management was sometimes complicated. The production of the work was too repetitive. this was a contract assignment and the job duties were not the same as when hired for the job.
good,"Great customers. Talk to physicians and figure out prescription details. Great work environment. "
good,CVS have good customers and bad customers. their customers are willing to help you find jobs and some customers are just rude. The team members are very nice and friendly.
good,The job was very challenging which is good for stimulation.  There was great job security.  The pay was great for the management salary.  But being on call 24/7 was extremely draining
good,"good first job, very easy for a high schooler. def room to move up in the CVS just put your time in. saw plenty of people who started from the bottom and work there up"
good,"Great company to work for, fast paced. Must like talking on the phone and have computer skills. Must be organized and always on time. Overall it is a good place to work."
good,"As a single parent I am in need of a better pay job with more hours. It is extremely fast-paced and need to have great time management skills, my only complaint is the pay."
good,"No comment"
good,"Work place is ok. Mostly serious about work and getting it done. Information about changes can sometimes be slow in reaching all persons involved."
good,"CVS was an overall good experience: fast paced, organized, nice people. My managers were at the gold star standard. I would run the front end by myself a lot. I did enjoy working in the pharmacy as well."
good,"CVS does pay for your technician training but besides that, the pay is low and not enough hours within the company making some stores very understaffed. The pharmacists in the company are really good though."
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier for CVS.  It was one of the few jobs that they didn't expect you to do too much stocking in your spare time because there wasn't a lot of spare time.  I enjoyed the time management and the way they ran their break schedules.  I wasn't thrilled when they moved me to stock and I found stocking to be a lot harder with a lot more running around.  There wasn't a clear way to figure out what we had and didn't have in stock, which made finding things for customers and restocking things really difficult."
good,"While I can say that for the most part I enjoy who i work for I find it difficult to keep my views positive because of Decisions by higher ups. Things tend to be trying at the company, with them taking over target its just extremely difficult right now."
good,A good place to work. The opportunity to learn and train with some  highly talented and motivated people proved to be very rewarding and helpful. The pace of work was challenging and rewarding
good,"The computer system helps with a lot of the work now.  "
good,"Much of the time spent working in this pharmacy was at the phones making and receiving calls. Any downtime had to be filled with some sort of work such as order entry or clerical duties. If no work was available, employees were sent on breaks or home. This is a very numbers-driven business due to accountability to insurance companies."
good,"You dont get much pay for the work that you do, but its okay. "
good,"Learned some mechanics of the healthcare field. Partially helped me get accepted into nursing school. Had some great pharmacist to work under, and some not so great."
good,"It gave me many skills for my next job, so I shouldn't have gone back, but I still grew some more. There is little further advancement though, without becoming an RPh. I like the team environment. Quality of life is based on the people you work with."
good,"I love going into work because I get to interact with patients in a community that is highly elderly driven and need much more attention and time, unfortunately with everything I have to do and the time I have, I have to cut it short with some of my patients and have to tell them that I will follow up with them next time they are in."
good,"CVS Health was a very stressful environment. They did pay decently, but not worth the stress.  It was not the right environment for me.  I needed a change."
good,"i wouldnt stay in retail too long, it can be demoralizing over time...but when you meet a few good people, they can make the day to day worth it until you find something better"
good,"My typical day at work consist of making sure that our customers are satisfied. As well as being on a cash register."
good,"This company is all about making their money. I felt as many nice people worked there there were just as many that were not so nice. As long as you have a good attitude, you can excel at this job."
good,The managers are constantly stressed and the pharmacy was always understaffed so you'd have the same few people working 10 hour days almost 6 days a week.
good,"poor employee management communication"
good,CVS has so many stores your survival is usually based on your store manager. if you have a store manager that is realistic about life and can teach you and not make excuses then your good.
good,"Not much training but that's anywhere"
good,"Its a corporate company,  You will have a lot of corporate busywork to deal with but sometimes the benefits of the large company (ie insurance and vacation) make it worth it."
good,"CVS pharmacy is a face-paced community pharmacy environment that demands a strong work ethic. It gives you the opportunity to help a lot of people, but is not for everyone because it is so demanding."
good,"work is pretty easy, it does get a bit hectic depending on the day of the week. Management is alright but I can tell it was biased when it comes to work schedules. The hardest part of the job is just coming in to work. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is making new acquaintances/friendships. (Some can be rude and likes to gossip) but it's good so far."
good,I'm very fortunate to work for this company and I have learned a lot. The patient population is diverse and I have had the opportunity to serve and care for both chronic and acute illnesses in the entire family.
good,Great place to work. With all the different locations all around the District of Columbia . The average day can get a little busy. I you like a fast past job then this is the place for you.
good,"I was only there for short period of time started out well worked at CVS Spring Lake NC, during my brief time there lots of issues between employees mostly management."
good,"they judged me for something I did not do in my past and it has nothing to do with them at all. co-worker were fine, everyone were there to do the job that basically it not that passiaon about it, it's a retails we all knows."
good,"CVS had bought out Longs Drugs in Northern CA, small town store, great relationship with the community at first, but over time it has lost it's purpose to remain involved and is now just a local chain store. Aside from management, was never made full time 40hr employee, being stuck at less than 38hrs/wk to not offer medical or retirement."
good,Expectations are really impossible! Customer care is suppose to be top priority but you have so many things that are expected from the techs everyday in a specific time manner from the pharmacist and corporate that unfortunately custumers are left feeling as if they really don't matter. Which then brings your scores down so you get hassled about that also.
good,"We’re reinventing pharmacy to have a more active, supportive role in each person’s unique health experience and in the greater health care environment—from advising on prescriptions to helping manage chronic and specialty conditions to providing quality walk-in medical care and pharmacy benefits management."
good,"I like working with my co-workers, it's a very fast paced environment which I like, the managers are great to work with , They offer a lot of overtime"
good,"Job included assisting customers, in person and on the phone, while also processing/filling medication prescriptions, fixing insurance issues and counting inventory."
good,"My position was simple and learner  fast."
good,"Very fast paced when it gets busy, it does get a little stressful since there aren't enough people working some days. Overall, my experience at cvs was good but not great. CVS does promote betterment of people and help them achieve better results and health."
good,it was my 1st job. worked here in high school and a little after high school. its beginners money but no place for someone with real life responsibilities.
good,I worked during a change buy out. IT system was much better than the prior system we used. Had much more functionality. Staff work flow was better with assigned tasks to staff allowing each member to rotate to different work stations through out the work day.
good,"It was very busy and there was a lot of work and responsibility. Many chores to do and difficult to keep up with the work load, and the position in general is underpaid for the demand. But dealing with the patients, customers, was fulfilling."
good,I enjoyed my first 2 years then a switch in management completely changed the experience. I was the best in the building but he was not kind to his employees. Destroyed the moral of the store. He should not be in a positon of power. He abuses it on purpose.
good,"When this company was Caremark, it was a very enjoyable place to work.  Management lead by example.  After the acquisition by CVS, we transitioned all of the accounting to RI.  I could tell from being in the building that it was a company that suffocates you."
good,"Good working conditions and Main focus is Great Customer Care.. Typical day is pulling medication, filling prescriptions, and inputting of prescriptions along with doing insurance."
good,Working in the pharamacy helped me become more comfortable talking with patients about their medications ans being in more confident in my knowledge of how the meds worked
good,"CVS is not a bad company to work for. You get decent benefits, the people are great to work with. However working in a tech support center sucks indeed."
good,"Work culture is ok, allows to work from home, which is a plus. However difficult to find guidance within the organization on moving up or around within the company."
good,"Overall, the work experience was great.  I was treated well by the district manager and all other employees.  Most of the patients feel that they are always right and should get their medications within mintutes."
good,"While working, I would be responsible for opening and closing the stores. I would work with stocking up on times in the store. I was the clerk when i checkout items."
good,This company offered room for growth. You could start your way at the bottom and move up as fast as you desired to. Management from different areas were not always helpful.
good,"I really enjoyed this job. It was a really fast pace job, because it was always busy. Employees had to work close to each other because it was a very small work place. Management had its ups and down, but it is a corporate company so that is expected. Sometimes it did get overwhelming and stressful but overall I did enjoy this job."
good,"I have learned that although CVS is a great company to work for, I feel I can do more somewhere else. Whether it is with another corporation or government sector, my goal is to help make a difference"
good,CVS is a very fast-paced and demanding work environment and is very strict in their training scheduling. I would only recommend this employer for people who are able to commit to their demands.
good,Do not want to place my personal feelings regarding a job on the internet. I rather keep my personal feelings regarding this company confidential rather than public .
good,I learned how to properly manage a pharmacy accordingly. Was in charge of certain metrics and let the district in most scores. Learned how to balance work and was the pharmacy manager of the second busiest store in the district of 25 pharmacies.
good,The job is okay.A typical day is just answering calls all day.I learned a lot about different medications.The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving.The hardest part is just staying awake.The culture is crowed.And management is par.
good,"1-Very easy to get hired directly into the position with competitive salary. (Mid 60s-low 80) Outside talent do get a significant higher pay than those who are promoted within."
good,"Only training I received was through the CVS program. No one I worked with took the time to train me, so I was stuck at one station that no one else wanted to be at. I took this job for the learning experience and did not learn one thing. Terrible management."
good,I just don't feel like they value their employees. Technicians are not making much and pharmacists are overworked. I would not recommend working here to anyone with a family to feed. This might be okay for teenagers or college students.
good,I would not want to work at CVS again.  The computer system is outdated and the workpace rushed.  High turnover rate; boring.  I felt that the technicians should have been paid better.
good,"CBS pharmacy is a super great place to work as a pharmacy technician, as long as you want to shop around for hours to work at all of of local pharmacies."
good,CVS doesn't believe in rotating anyone in pharmacy. Very poor employee compensation. Work conditions are horrible. They work on skeleton crews and overworks their pharmacists.
good,"I would rate CVS as a great place for individuals to begin working right out of school. However, their employees are underpaid and their voices are not heard by management."
good,"Review store plan to make sure all product was set correctly and to company guidelines. Ensuring all product was in stock, and working with vendors to make product available."
good,"was an easy place to work, but always low staffed, the weekends we didn't get to take a break because we were so busy, no drive thru so makes it easier"
good,I would love to say I enjoyed working here but unfortunately my colleagues were literally the worst people on earth. Thank you for hiring managers without a conscience.
good,"I really enjoyed working with my coworkers as well as management. However, corporate is very focused on the bottom line and it never seemed like they cared about employees or customers."
good,"Typically, on a daily basis work starts at 7 am and we beginning to help patients with understanding their insurance and benefits. Ive learned so much about the way insurance and benefits are processed and am now able to explain it very well. Management is pretty fair. The hardest part of my job is having to explain unexpected changes to patients. I feel that the most enjoyable part is actually being able to make a difference with some of these patients."
good,"CVS pharmacists do NOT counsel patients (they just hit the ""decline"" button without even asking the patient if they would like a counsel by the pharmacist) which is completely ILLEGAL. I would never recommend working for CVS pharmacy because it is a breeding ground for law breaking."
good,CVS has a good computer system but is constantly cutting hours. Less employee hours cuts the quality of the service. They did provide educational sessions once a month that were helpful.
good,Fast paced and satisfying job. There is a lot of information to learn but it can be fun helping customers with prescription needs. Coworkers were great but the management was poor.  The corporation focus more on improving sales and flu shot statistics rather than customer and employee happiness.
good,"I liked working for CVS. If you work hard enough you can move up very easily. BUT, you have to be very political. If you manage to get in a bad side of someone  your career can be detroyed."
good,"CVS was a good company to work for, however the experience was tainted by a poorly performing supervisor. This supervisor was distrustful of the staff and due to this turnover was great."
good,"Assisting patients with medical prescriptions calling the doctors for them."
good,"This company constantly changes rules, does not respect employees, and simply requires too much for the rate of pay and stress level. I made some good friends and loved my customers"
good,"A typical work day is helping guest check out and making sure all customers get whatever they need, Making sure all guest are helped by employees and making sure all employee work excellent at all time.The hardest part of the job would watching out for thieves. The most enjoyable part would be meeting different guest."
good,good work culture. very relaxed environment always have someone there willing to help. training was very explanatory love the diversity and engagment.
good,"A great company to work for, I believe they need to continue to develop a culture on building a stronger team with caring leaders who"
good,"Not enough hours due to cut hours demands, to make ends meet. Stressful and short handed. Only one tech at night which usually gets customers angry. A particular manager is very different in attitude towards me and great with everyone else which makes it difficult to work and intimidating to ask questions since they constantly are treating me like a child and talk to me as if I lack intelligence. Putting me on the spot in front of everyone like a child  and feel extremely embarrassed.  Co-workers are great to learn from and willing to help. Very little training and are thrown into the fire with expected knowledge of everything especially from specific pharmacist. The pay is sometimes not worth the stress."
good,"very clean and well maintained, customers are taken care of promptly. all technicians were treated equally by rotating and maintaining different work areas."
good,Work is very hectic. The environment is not the best to teach. I love working in pharmacy but I feel as though we need a better place to learn the in and outs.
good,"The hours are long and the work hard.  Must be able to do repetitive motions daily and stand for long hours.  Must be able to pay attention to detail and move very quickly, which may burn you out just as quick."
good,CVS is a challenging company to work for with outrageous expectations to live up to. if they only took the time to care for their employees how they care for themselves the company could be better. they also need to come up to date with there technology.
good,A very unique place to interact with patients. This is a great place to help patients improve their lives and live better. I learned here greatly. It was for me a very positive life experience and is a life changer. It is indeed good to have direct interaction with patients.
good,"I was not employed there long enough to fairly complete this. While there, I answered calls from customers regarding their medications.  I would send then refills and whatever else they needed assistance with."
good,friendly environment great hours responsible for counting medication daily and accountable for daily totals on register filled prescriptions on a daily basis
good,"job is okay place is very messy, you can never get your privacy. everybody always has to know whats going on with in your life. the job overall is good my boss was great just don't care for the people"
good,CVS is a company that has no appreciation for its employees.  They work them really hard but no team builds or team events.  I think this what they lack the most
good,"I have not worked there in 10 years, but was a good company at the time."
good,It's been very long since I worked at this place so I am sure lots of things have changed but it was an okay place to work at. Had it's own cafe for lunch.
good,"einventing pharmacy to have a more active, supportive role in each person’s unique health experience and in the greater health care environment—from advising on prescriptions to helping manage chronic and specialty conditions to providing quality walk-in medical care and pharmacy benefits management."
good,"This job positiong for myself was understaffed, underpaid, overworked, no team work, ""favoritism"", severe disrespect and hostile work environment to work in."
good,It is busy and can be rewarding if you like working with the public but there is always too much work to do and not much in the way of compensation unless you are management.
good,handled calls from members and helped solve problems that they had with their prescriptions that was within my scope of work as a pharmacy technician.
good,n/a - in process of career change.  unable to provide more information.  It would be inappropriate to provide feedback at this time due to conflict of interest
good,"Great staff great company great deals great locations"
good,A typical day at the CVS i works at is a 24 hour non stop busy store. Its is very fast past and short of staff. It is a team working environment to get through the day and complete all tasks.
good,I was only at CVS as a pharmacy tech intern but the time I spent there I enjoyed it. I shadowed the pharmacy tech and pharmacist. I could always tell it was super busy and you must have the ability to multitask. You may deal with irate customers which is understandable because sometimes it takes a while for insurance to comply. You need to have a tough skin and a friendly demeanor to ensure the work experience is a good one.
good,"The company was a great company to work for. Just standing on your feet more than 8hr a day was very stressful. You need to young to work at this job, very physical labor."
good,there is never a dull moment when you come to work. I would receive process and refill new prescriptions and refill request. I would help the pharmacist in any regard to any type of help.
good,in the pharmacy you don't learn everything right away so it gets annoying when customers ask something and you don't know the answer so you have to ask somebody else for help meanwhile your line at the register is getting longer or the people you need to ask are busy.. the pharmacy is ALWAYS busy
good,"Like most places, successes are attributed to your manager and above, not you. Problems roll down hill, never managers' fault. Age discrimination barely hidden."
good,"It is one of the largest retail chains in the country. Advantages include; on the job training, flexible schedule, and ability to easily relocate while remaining with the company. There are many opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,"Typical day is very busy, and fast pace. The work load is'nt bad if you have full staff for the day. If you do not then you will have to pick up the work in other areas which can be stressful."
good,CVS warehouse was a pretty decent job. They gave raises every four months and the work was pretty easy. I learned how to move at a fast pace and have good accuracy.
good,"When you are working at a retail location you are always on the edge ans stressed out. Of course the Target locations are a bit more comfortable than the stand alone CVS locations. The leadership is also really easy to work with."
good,It was a good experience at CVS Pharmacy.  I enjoyed helping  the patients and working and learned a lot from working at a retail setting.  Working in cvs thought me how to balance and prioritize my time.
good,"Have to be on your toes and work at a fast pace typing prescriptions, filing prescriptions, calling insurance companies, and handling customers in a timely manner"
good,"It can be a great place to work if your position is integral to the company's current goals. Once you become obsolete, they are quick to cut you out of the picture. The healthcare offerings cost the employees more than they should."
good,Good opportunity to build relationships with patients in the community setting. I enjoyed getting to interact with customers on a weekly basis and get to know them.
good,CVS Health is a large company currently number seven in the Fortune 500. It has an IT department and the employees like to use computers to do their job.
good,"if you do, you will be written up. they still want you to come to work even though you are highly contagious which can lead to the patients becoming sick."
good,"Job is good if you know what you're doing. Sometimes the politics are annoying, but that's anywhere. The company itself is great! Good benefits too. Free prescriptions!"
good,Very stressful work environment. Retail jobs are very stressful. I deciding to go back to school and pursue a career in criminal justice. I decide i never wanted any one person to have the ability take my job away from me. I needed a skill that wasn't easily replaceable .
good,"There are pros and cons dealing with customers with different conditions and mindset, at certain point things will be out of control and people may get used to it, great place to work but not as Pharm Tech"
good,Cvs warehouse is a pretty good place to work for especially if you a young person starting off your work history it has great benefits.It is a good place to get you some time in with a company but not much opportunity for advancement
good,Could be better. High volume with reduced tech help. Drive thru is a soul crusher. Long shifts usually 12 hours. Medical benefits are high deductibles.
good,This place closed new company bought it . it was a good place to work loved the residents. good shifts and like the vacation time and sick time. we also got a floating holiday for your birthday.
good,No overtime for contract employees. Wish they were hiring full time employees. I liked working in a fast paced environment. I liked being mentored by the Pharmacists.
good,I love the staff. However the workers are more dedicated to the company than the company is to their employees. they let you know you will and can be replaced regardless of how long you've been with the company. They're not very appreciate of lower staff such as pharmacy techs and cashiers
good,I opened the bakery every morning and am reliable with an alarm code and key. I wait on customers and do my part in the bakery such as frying donuts and baking bread. My favorite part of my job is interacting with customers for their products and putting smiles on customers faces and making them happy.
good,"Very fast paced work environment, demanding but rewarding.  This job requires compassion, focus, detail oriented and ability to handle high stress. The staffing is rather tight so we often have patients who are upset that they have to wait longer or hold on the phone longer.  CVS is making progress on it's technology which is very helpful and makes the job flow better."
good,"I worked in the IV Billing department, after 8 months the company decided to move the billing department and I was laid off, felt as I wasted my time."
good,Very busy in the pharmacy dept.  I learned to multi-task while providing excellent customer service. In Store and Pharmacy management are great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is trying to work in different stations at the same time without making a mistake due to hours being cut by upper management.  The most enjoyable part is when every staffs are helping each other during busy hours.
good,Decent place to work and great starting opportunity. Unfortunately growth opportunities are very difficult and the pay is not on par with the work performed.
good,CVS is a good company to get your feet wet so to speak but their training methodology could do with a radical change for the better... I found their pharmacy technician training to fall backwards rather than propel forwards with an expectation that their reps learn remotely over a computer and very limited hands on training with an overworked pharmacist.
good,"working hard< constantly learning new things, my  CVS PHARMACY is the busy CVS in Saint Louis!! Its a diverse environment, management i thing i would like to see them be a little bit more hands  ons. the hardest part is trying to statisfy every costumer u come in contact with.. the best part of my day is leaving for the day!!"
good,It wasn't bad. I worked there part time while finishing school. They worked with my school schedule which was nice. It was a job and I was able to get experience with customer service.
good,I would take 80-110 calls per day in which I would take orders for members prescriptions for mail order and would make sure that they were getting the correct prescriptions and making sure that their accounts were in good standing and take payments.
good,"Job culture has changed and the Job was eliminated, enjoyed working at the fast paced growing company since the beginning and thru the growing pains of the past years"
good,"I enjoyed being able to work around my school schedule. Working there was different back then and it differed considering I worked at different stores with different needs. "
good,"typical day- depends on the day of the week. checking emails, shops, inventory, "
good,I again refuse to review another previous employer.  This is not something that should be required by a job search website.  Please consider removing this requirement.
good,work your tail off. recognition is not often and your mistakes are maximized. the staff you hire are your control but no one applys because it is minimum wage work.
good,"Even though my pharmacy has great hours to offer if you are part-time and great co-workers, the duties I carry out do not reflect the compensation I get."
good,Good place to work with employees dedicated to improving and providing healthcare for all.  Advancement is difficult and dependent on your specific manager.  Think of it as almost an apprenticeship.
good,A typical day at work was very stressful as soon as you start your shift the phone never stopped ringing till the end of your shift. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with we would do fun things within our team to keep the moral up such as playing word games or decorating our cubicles like beach theme and bring food in to have a party.
good,"Busy"
good,"You will be always occupied with work for 12hrs in a day for which you need to work for 14-15hrs in a day."
good,"It is an okay place to work, I majorly got cut in hours recently without being told it was going to happen' as well as several of my colleagues. It is a good place to work to get certified without going to an actual campus as well as getting paid while getting certified. The person that does our scheduling isn't a manger but she gets her way no matter what and puts her schedule ahead of anyone else's."
good,cvs kept me around a long time by giving me incentives.  They expect you to work hard but don't compliment your performance.  Rather they always remind you that you have areas in which you might improve.
good,"change in management constantly, supervisors always under microscope, staff hours getting cut and changed without prior notice because of corporates rules"
good,My day begins at 6 AM this sorting boxes until 10:30 AM then I am met by UPS and FedEx deliveries until management says the day is over which they are never really sure of.
good,Served as a staff pharmacist for approximately two years at CVS pharmacy in the Montgomery Alabama district. Part of a team that lead one of the top performing pharmacies in the district.
good,I was working on a blue cross and blue shield of Ohio need to verify insurance durable medical equipment benefits and hold time was more than 1:30 minute on a phone and I have a goal to complete 15 insurance verification per day and this call took more than one hour thirty mints in a eight hours shift after a long hold with the insurance I was able to verify benefits the hardest part is holding time the most enjoyable part of my job is working 2 cases at a time so I can complete more task while on hold and I really enjoy working as a insurance verification .
good,"Work is fast-paced and can be stressful. I've learned it's best to keep communication short when dealing with difficult people."
good,"CVS is a good company. Your daily task involve cashiering, stocking, cleaning, and direct customer service. On occasion you will be given task to be completed such as Seasonal items placing or remodel a shelf area to make way for new product."
good,"good company to work for if you are lucky to have a fair district manager"
good,"A typical day at work involves filling prescriptions, assisting customers, and handling insurance issues. I learned how to effectively handle insurance and customer service issues in addition to efficient workflow strategies."
good,I worked as a pharmacy tech at CVS pharmacy for 3+ years. it was a busy location that I worked at. there was hardly any turnover with techs but a good amount of turnover with management and supervisors
good,"This company is such a big company that seems to not care about there employees and we are always severely understaffed so the people scheduled are having to do 3 peoples jobs, and they dont pay enough for all the work that is being done."
good,"Working with CVS can be a little overwhelming, but rewarding at the same time. The fast paced work flow can help to prepare a person to work in any kind of environment"
good,"Constantly on the move. Very busy location in need of some time and TLC. Great place to test your limits and abilities both physically, mentally and emotionally."
good,This is an ok place to work but dont expect to be promoted even if your told your going to. You will be yelled at by customers on a daily basis. You do get to work with some amazing co-workers. You are underpayed for what you are put through.
good,"It was a good experiment. I learned about the pharmaceutical industry , drugs, procedures and insurances."
good,"Loved working at CVS for the customers. I also loved my job and what, my job title included but I was very under paid. I also didnt like the drama and how we couldnt work as a team,"
good,"Answer inbound calls, most difficult part of job was sitting for 8 hours straight. Was very team oriented. Had team competitions between pharmacists and pharmacy techs."
good,Consumes so much of my personal time that leaves me no time for my family. I have to say I do have a great team working together. Unfortunately I have to use so much of my time for projects that I am unable to complete during working hours.
good,Explore my knowledge more on skills.Got an opportunity to work on Mainframe and Web based development environment.Great place to work.Worked on Production environment as well with tight deadlines.
good,"Primarily your success is  judged on client reviews but is also observed by your peers,  managers and internal partners; therefore your ability to build relationships is paramount to success. Your ability to get things done despite the red tape is key. You are expected to be willing to work as late as it takes to handle things that happened when you were at a meeting, training, or other things out of your control.  You will be worked to death at welcome season. You will do all these things and more because you will love your job but it can take its toll.  You will need to be more than you thought possible, work harder than you have ever worked in your life, be stronger than you knew, and be patient to the core. You will have compassion, learn when to bite your tongue, when to speak your mind  and when to just smile. Most days you will do each of these."
good,Everything in the pharmacy is fast and alot of times out of control. Management did not communicate very well with staff. Schedule changes were constant and without notice.
good,"Numbers driven company which drives upper management to enforce reaching numbers, numbers, numbers! Will sacrifice employee satisfaction to meet payroll goals, reducing employees and increasing work load."
good,I enjoy talking to patients and setting up their order to have delivered to their homes and to the local store.  I have a small team that I work on and the team is awesome to work with.
good,My first real job. I learned a great deal working there. My supervising pharmacist was very kind and patienthe and always willing to teach me.
good,High stress High pressure call center job with mediocre pay.  High call demand.  Tied to phone.  Constant monitoring.  No personal freedom
good,"This a great company to work for. We get a lot of complaints from the customers for us being shorthand. If not shorthand, this company would flow very smoothly."
good,"Great work culture, work life balance, IJP opportunities, strong leaders as managers. Company transportation, Salary, hike and bonus, no micro management, listen to employee concerns,"
good,"I gave exceptional Customer Service and I will continue to give my job 100 percent!"
good,"In a day I would order refills for someone's medications, explain their benefits and assist a pharmacist with filling an order.  This is a good place to advance."
good,"Like every company CVS has its pros and its cons. The pay is not that great for the position I was holding in the company, and the hours are not that convieient if you have a family."
good,they say you can buy education but you cant buy class. some of the pharmacists I work with are lazier and dummer than the technicians lol hire more pharmacist that have more integrity and know how to do their job
good,"Busy typical day, coworkers work together. always making the customer happy. CVS is a good stepping stone to get your further in your career. management is changing."
good,"Pretty cool place to work and if you land up in the right group, it can be fun and rewarding. Some areas allow work from home. "
good,"The job itself was fast passed and kept you extremely busy. Which was ok by me most of the time. The downside was the way the employees were treated. No one was really treated as if they were valued. The mandatory overtime and the way they would handle it was also ridiculous. We would find out a half hour before we were suppose to go home that we weren't allowed to leave until everything was done. It wouldn't matter how long it would take, we had to stay until it was done, or be fired."
good,I  met  a  lot  of  good  people  while  working  at  CVS  Health Pharmacy.  I   also  was  able  to  work  at  different  locations  when  there  were  not  enough  hours  at  certain  times  of  the  year.
good,"Management takes an everyday role in the store operations, very busy place to work, training is somewhat lacking - left alone after showing something once, some coworkers are very helpful.  Hardest part is multi tasking while on register"
good,Great place to work  longs hours though. Different things to do everyday definitely room to grow and improve your self. Could have longer breaks but all in all great place
good,CVS Pharmacy is not an ideal working situation. The hours are flexible but most of the time the workplace is very understaffed. Employees are not paid well compared to the stress level.of the everyday job.
good,"I initially liked working here, however I found the out going and in coming managers were absolutely difficult to work with not to mention the   one staff nurse they had is simply crazy.  I was hired to work PRN or part time and the company tries to work you as you're full time.  Apply only if you want short term work and do not plan to stay long."
good,"It was a very nice company to work for, the work was very manageable and the customers were very nice. My boss worked around my college schedule."
good,"Store mangers don't do any work and micro manage. "
good,"provided excellent customer service while answering a multiple line phone:  approximately 45 per day, researched customer refill inquiries and contact physicians to process new refills, reached out to CVS on-site pharmacist to ensure proper billing, utilized medical terminology for billing and vendor inquires."
good,Good place to work with flexible hours and good benefits with time off. Good work relation ship with coworkers and supervisors. Room for advancement within company depending on position held..
good,"You basically do the same thing everyday for 8 hours. The pay is OK for the work you do. Not much interaction with others, so that may be good or bad. Depending on the person."
good,"This was a very stressful position and a little too faced paced at times. I enjoyed my co-workers, but it was just a little too much. I enjoyed the customers, however there were many who expected things to happen that were out of my control."
good,"Productive Small Company with Fun Workplace."
good,"Always stayed busy on my toes.  Had to be fast and efficient with taking prescriptions, filling the drugs, and selling them to customers.  Also there was quite a bit of customer service relations involved."
good,"The Hardest Part in these project when I am used SQL server 2008 so many SQL functions didn't work directly but I can solved all problems, The fun part of  these project is we are  went some beautiful  places for refreshment"
good,Great place to work and great management. They have great healthcare benefits and great vacation time. But you don't have a set schedule it various every week.
good,"Answer phones, Sold jewelry, Fixed jewelry, Receiving department,  Data entry work, Engraving and other office duties.  Hardest part of this job learned how to multi-task but this was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,This is a face paced company.  I have learned that everyone matters and important.  I enjoy working with all of my team members.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the patients.
good,"I do mostly Pickup and Drive Thru."
good,This job was a good job. Fun people that I worked with and very understanding customers. Working here MADD me very knowledgeable and taught me a good amount of interesting facts.
good,"Punch in, talk on the phone all day with customers, take your breaks, then punch out and go home. It doesn't get any more basic than that."
good,Thankful to have a job in this economy.  Satisfaction helping people obtain better-health outcomes. Thankful that I didn't have to buy groceries with my credit card for awhile.
good,On a typical day you are treated like a worker with a number not a name. They are all about production with very little care for their employees.
good,i love the people i work with and the people you serve are some of the greatest people i know. the hardest part is dealing with people yelling at you for things that are beyond your control. but the best part is the bond you make with other technicians.
good,it was fun working at cvs and communicating with other associate and also great experience. everything that i learned there will help me with my future work.
good,They are ok to work for.  They don't really care about you but if you keep your head down and do your job they are ok.  Co-workers were awesome but upper management is under a lot of pressure to perform so it was sometimes difficult to rationalize with them when all they want are better numbers.
good,I loved this job. good job for a person that is looking for part time and also going to school. Has flexible schedule and you get to move up position
good,"- fill, file, type prescriptions"
good,"Inbound call center, Refilled orders and verified delivery .  Also followed up with MDO offices for prescriptions. Learned about the different medications /"
good,"very busy work days but it makes time go by really fast, i love my job and am happy helping people. We need to be very patient for our customers."
good,Love all the different jobs that you can do.  Training needs to improve. More hours are needed to be scheduled for optimal efficiency
good,I would like a change in environment I have been with the company for 5 years and would like different experiences and challenges.  I want to improve myself and do great work.  I would also like to be able to advance with in the company.
good,"Nice company the has good hours and friendly environment. Positive energy, everyone has a chance to cross learn positions. Company that pushes for quality work an helps achieve success."
good,"Filling prescriptions, making sure the delivery runs go out on time."
good,"CVS has a lot of training and I loved the people I worked with, on a corporate level they aren't very good to their employees. Benefits were ok"
good,"The management was great, the working environment was great. fun place to work for, very accommodating. Great co workers. I would work there again."
good,The location  worked for was open 24 hours. It was located near the hospital and was always busy. Pay was low-moderate and employee moral was down.
good,"boa empresa, mais ainda em mudança, nao tem cultura formada"
good,"i like it but move up and find brighter future some where else with higher chances to learn "
good,Gave a low rating because of the people that work higher up in the company.. I feel like they don't treat their employees fairly at all. My manager that I worked with was awesome..most of my co-workers were great to work with too.
good,The company is ok to work for but I wouldn't recommend it to others. Since i have a family now they are not understanding. You have no idea how many sick hours or PTO. Not happy with sick time policy
good,A lot of multitasking but in the end I have helped people understand the importance of their health with taking their medication. Providing people with the education that is better to comprehend coming from a professional.
good,"Very convenient, and easy to use website when it comes to the toughness of the job teaching process with many tools to help a new college grad succeed in getting their dream job."
good,"They focus too much on friendly service and not enough on fair prices. Boring place to work. Decent place overall, but i would not recommend it as a job choice"
good,"Loved the job from February 2005 to September 30th 2016 .  This was a hard job to leave ... One of many layed off  .  "
good,"Cuando hay buenos jefes se crece como profesional ,lamentable a veces hay unos jefes que no valoran su trabajo y su personal ,la division entre trabajo y tu familia es muy delgada"
good,great salary and work life balance but some issues with management.  don't have much more to say than that.  I was a part of a larger team
good,I learned you need to speak up for yourself in order to get the necessary resources to you job well.  I learned how to manage people as well and oversee multiple areas of the store.
good,"Working for Omnicare was an experience. My department was understaffed. While there was much time for over time, it was highly likely that you would get called in on your day off. Can be highly stressful. The co workers were by far the best part."
good,good paying job hardest part was keeping up fast work.people around me were good. learned how warehousing works good enviroment
good,"CVS offers flexible hours and days off, however, the pharmacy is  typically short staffed because of lack of payroll.  The health insurance is terrible."
good,"With a pharmacy that is ""On Call 24 hours a day, seven days a week"" the workflow and schedule can be unpredictable. Lots of overtime if you're willing as some employees limit their work contribution. As a technician or pharmacist you automatically enter into a week-long on call rotation."
good,"I worked for CVS on a part time basis.  It was very busy and the secret shoppers kept you on your toes.  The photo center was very interesting.  I learned how to develop photos.  This was my first job position where I straightened shelves, helped with inventory, and made sure food was up to date."
good,"As the largest Pharmacy in the nation, the company takes little pride in the dedication of the low level employees. It's all about numbers, and not nearly as interested in the safety of the public it relies on for profit. In any field of Medicine,a fast food mentality is dangerous and possibly deadly. Shareholder Corporations have no business making decisions in staff levels and time budgets where patient safety is concerned. No relief or meal times for the pharmacist working 12 to 14 hour shifts. That on top of having little to no pharmacy technician help because of shareholder profit means more to this Company than the probability of a patients harm or potential death."
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician at a twenty-four hour CVS pharmacy has shown that one must be extremely patient and tolerant of not only the workload but also the patients which come in. The atmosphere can be very intense at moments and at times very unruly, however working with a compassionate and experienced staff makes the workday much more bearable. I suggest this position for anyone looking to step into the medical world, especially those looking into pharmaceuticals."
good,"Work usually had 4 technicians and 1 (maybe 2) pharmacists present. Though we have rushes often, the environment is so relaxed with joking around and music, it makes it difficult to get things done effectively or efficiently. I learned how to get my job done successfully around all the chaos that goes on. Management is very nice and understanding about most thing, but also relaxed, and part of the work-flow problem I mentioned. The hardest part of my job is the rushes that come in. If not handled right away, in the right manner and flow, the pharmacy gets out of hand and really backed up with business really fast. The most enjoyable part of my job is when everything is cleared out and cleaned up, knowing I helped someone's (the customer) day get better with my service and their orders being met."
good,Very stressful job. You learned to be patience. Team work. Schedule change all the time. Poor salary. You have to be stand up for more than 8 hours.
good,"Corporate expects the same level of production while cutting hours. I can do it but it's a challenge to keep up with all the work with less people to fall back on, then customers get mad because they have to wait so long and complain to corporate. Corporate then gets on our case as to why people have to wait so long and why other tasks need to get done when hardly anyone is working due to the cut in hours."
good,"Managed several stores with increasing business.  Managed the Harbison Ave store, #1 pharmacy in the company during my term as manager, "
good,handle prescription refills day to day. Build customer service. Handle insurance rejections and claims. Train for certifications.
good,"with the advent of the ACA, the Para dyne of medical services,  has been permanently changed. Large $$$ community pharmacy, has fallen upon the use of metrics, as the evaluation tool, of choice. by cutting store hours, restricting  and rescheduling staffing hours, the workload has gotten to be considerable, when trying to rendering the usual and considerable care, for patients. It can be quite ...challenging."
good,"A lot of work and not enough people. Company is full of cut backs,but it it a good stepping stone if you want to be a pharmacy technician."
good,I worked here while I was finishing school and it worked out because I worked only weekends. It was sometimes monotonous.
good,Productive working company I I enjoy my job as well as the members I feel very productive in role on my job. I feel as though I'm lapart of a team and not just a job. There always something to learn every plan is different so you learn something new every day.
good,"They provided good pay, I had good co-workers good direct supervisor's, I enjoyed working under them, friendly work environment, I was close to home I enjoy working for this company for fifteen years."
good,It is an ok job. Not really a career. Does not pay very well for the time that I have worked there. The employees are very talkative.
good,"CVS is great for training, educating, and certifying their pharmacy technicians. However, pharmacists are over worked along with the technicians. Policies need be instilled to proect the staff from harassing patients."
good,Indeed is a great website where you can post job and jo reviews about companies. It is also a great benefit because it gives you a variety of jobs to look for in the process.
good,Location is very calm and easy to learn a lot of new things. The patients are easy going and barely have any complaints. All employees are really nice and are willing to help each other when there are issues that cannot be resolved alone.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my co-workers.  The management was overly focused on sales and whichever product of the month they were pushing.  It wasn't on the service provided to the customers or what they really need.
good,CVS does not care for the well-being of patients or its employees. They only care for profitability. I generally do not recommend CVS pharmacy to anyone.
good,CVS Health is a great place to work. I would recommend this employer to anyone seeking job employment management is excellent.
good,"I do not have much to say......it is ok and the pay is ok as well "
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician at CVS pharmacy definitely had its ups and downs, but unfortunately, it had more downs than up for myself. Even though I might say a few things I did not like about working at CVS, I have to say that I do not ever regret working at any job I get hired at including CVS. A typical day at CVS was definitely very busy and fast-pace and at times it seemed like there wasn't enough hours in a day to finish your duties. But with that being said, I do like working in a fast-pace environment. I like being on my feet constantly, having something to do the whole time I'm working. Being at CVS, I learned how to deal with difficult customers in a polite way but also not take it so personally. My customer service skills are definitely stronger after being employed at CVS. Management could have been more supportive to us new employees. The hardest part of the job was probably the conflict between what to get done. Customers come first, of course. And because it was such a busy location, it was hard to get other duties finished by a certain time."
good,"I am grateful for the customer service skills I have received from my experience with CVS. The hardest part of my job is pleasing Corporate, my Manager,and the customers all at once. Most of my co-workers are great people to work with. The best ting about my position is there is always something happening so it is really hard to get bored."
good,"Pharmacy module included consumables management, maintenance of drug composition, batch-wise stocking of drugs, and drug categorization for reporting. Pharmacy module contains regular duties of pharmacist like maintaining the product details. Administrator can control the overall application. The Billing module allowed billing and receivables, looked into multiple modes of payment and rates definition for services."
good,"Have mixed feelings towards my time at CVS. The training was pretty poor, which is really not ideal for anyone. The other coworkers were pretty nice, management could have been much better and far more professional. Strange work hours, however they were still very flexible with scheduling to your needs which I appreciated. Not a ton to say."
good,Excellent benefits.  Great shift availability.  Down side is low pay. Holiday pay is 1 1/2 times for hours worked on top of 8 hours paid for full time employees.
good,"Okay company to work for, but if you are looking for to learn new Technologies then this is not the right place for you. Look somewhere else."
good,"A typical day of work is a 10 hour shift due to a lot of overtime to meet business needs. I worked typlically 55 to 60 hours a week. They have great benefits for their employees. If they see they you are trying to better your performance, they give you chances, coachings, and time for improvement. The only thing that needs to improve is the way the the escalation team talks to the representatives and the poor communication between the higher management and other employees."
good,"processed approximately 75 calls/day regarding low income health insurance; CHP, FHP, Health NY, medicaid; coverage, copays, providers, plans"
good,"processed photo orders on a daily basis, provided customer service, help break down truck on a weekly basis. I trained new photo staff as needed.  Was back up cashier when the store gets busy"
good,"Workflow steady but often understaffed. Co-workers cooperative and worked diligently.  Spent alot of time remaining after closing to catch up on work,  Customers were tolerable, Working during holiday season joyful."
good,As a student it was difficult to learn because only full time/long term employees were given the attention and training. The students were allowed to only be in on the register
good,"Typical day at work assisting members with prescription needs and solving problems with medication issues, along with explaining benefit plan options to members. Challenging place to work, consistently high employee turn overs. I learned quickly handling complex issues and interactions with management on problem solving issues. Co-workers were great if they were subject matter experts. Hardest part was handling the constant quarterly changing in shift schedules. Need to be a bit more stable."
good,This store doesn't seem to have much going on during the day except around that pharmacy area which usually is packed. The employees aren't always active which creates a plain environment.
good,"Working at CVS had its pros and cons, work/life balance in management is slim to none; as you are the one who works when others cannot show up to work. They do not provide front store with enough hours to prevent overworking and burning out. The compensation and benefits are good, especially if health insurance is a priority."
good,I enjoyed my time at CVS. Good place to work and the people are nice. Wonderful learning experience overall. I would recommend to others.
good,Overall Decent place to work. Depending on location it can be stressful. The pay and raises aren't that great but the potential to move up is there
good,The Location I worked in was very racist. But the job was very fair and it was enjoyable to an extent. It has its very bad rush hours but the job is fairly good. Very small room for growth but good for a part time job if you really need it.
good,"Its a great place to work if you like to constantly move and constantly stand. Its also great for building relationships with guest and experiencing all types of people because of the area this pharmacy is located in. It is very stressful, must meet requirements, time frames and stay within the metrics expectations."
good,I learn a lot in this company but it was taking to much time from my personal live and I don't think it was fear with me or my family
good,fast past getting order out on time. making sure using right stock call in part number to refill stock. getting alone with other was very importance .pick in such small space.
good,"A typical day at CVS would be slow up until noon or sometimes 3 p.m when the kids get out of school or during rush hour. I learned how to stock the shelves with merchandise. Management at CVS wasn't always the best however, it wasn't completely terrible. My co-worker was very helpful when they were there. The hardest part about the job was trying to leave the cashier to help a customer because it was nobody there to help the customer but me. The part I enjoyed the most was being able to make the customer visit at CVS very welcoming and putting a smile on their faces."
good,"The company would be better if the departments were able to allow growth within. The company has great potential for overtime and benefits, but growth is more important to me than that."
good,"enjoyable work, fast pace and routine.  learned many skills and to work as a team. had a good manager who was enjoyable to work with."
good,Horrible benefits had absolutely no work/life balance. It's a great place to learn about pharmacy insurance benefits. I would recommend working here as entry level..
good,"the company is very nice place to work at, but sometimes its not always structured with scheduling. They under pay their Pharmacy Technicians i was hired with a tech trainee pay but have not moved the pay. i'm a certified technician"
good,"Have a long list of duties to do plus having to work with the customers. Didn't learn anything new. Co-works okay, not always the best choices."
good,I learned so much about medicine and daily things that the pharmacy undergo. It gave me a different perspective on the process it takes to fill prescriptions.
good,There was always something new everyday and the opportunity to learn a variety of things and improve on certain skills.
good,"At CVS, I gained a lot of experience. My coworkers were friendly and I enjoyed interacting with the customers. Much of my retail knowledge came from working at CVS."
good,"It is a lot to know, and a lot to remember. Its almost overwhelming. If you're determined and really want it, it won't be an issue."
good,Great development opportunities with strong manager mentors!  Good balance between retail and health industry.  I recommend this company to others.
good,CVS is a good place to work. Very demanding and fast paced. The turn-over rate is very quick due to long hours constantly on your feet.
good,"Prescription entry"
good,"Great company if your just getting into pharmacy, training is awesome and you learn a lot. A place you'll love till you leave"
good,"Every busy work places, have to learn lots of things. Have to be multitasking skills and knowledge of insurances and billing. Have to be very fast efficiency."
good,I did not enjoy working for this company. I did not like the kind of job that I was doing. It was a lot of work for few pay and no benefits.
good,"A typical day at work would be Mondays getting back in the grove to start a new week."
good,Greeting and engaging with customers. I learned working with this company how to deal with multiple vendors that come into our store. Management and co workers all were great people and helped me on my retail journey.
good,Very busy and fast paced environment. Learned a lot about insurance companies and medication names. The pharmacy is open 24 hours
good,"Just like any other job, ups and downs. This company has low ins coverage especially for making billions in revenue every quarter"
good,Review and process medical claims for accurate payment.  Adjust incorrect payments in a timely manner with accuracy.  Multi task and complete tasks quickly.
good,"This store is very busy, working here a person is always ""on your toes"".  There is very little downtime, this is a great place for a busybody, if you like calm quiet atmosphere it won't be found here."
good,Worked both the day and night and the people there were overall great. The downside was just the nights being worked but other than that was a great time.
good,"I enjoy pharmacy, and the experiences associated with my job. I started with Target in 2011 after an unfavorable break with Rite Aid, and overall I loved working for the company. I was excited about working with CVS, but the transition has been difficult. It is difficult to receive all the accurate information about the transition itself and what will happen to my own job and benefits. I feel as if I am learning something different from what was said each day. I am hoping to branch out from pharmacy, but I am excited about all the CVS might have in store for myself and my coworkers."
good,"Ok place to work, however there is less and less staff and not rehiring which doesn't allow to do job satisfactory. Hard work is not noticed and not rewarded."
good,"Very successful at my job, very pleasant customers at the store i was at, but not very happy staff in the pharmacy. The store I worked at could use better pharmacists."
good,"The customer always comes first at CVS. CVS took care of its employees just as well as it did its customers."
good,"High expectation on interns"
good,Having the opportunity to work from home has been a blessing. Savings on gas has definitely been a plus.Typical day of work would be logging into the computer/phone system to take daily calls from members concerning their benefits and mail order prescriptions.
good,"Setup new pre-imaged Windows 7 workstations as a PC refresh for the old XP systems."
good,Pleasant work environment. Learned a lot as company grew thru acquisitions. Company provided home infusion services.
good,"Dispensing medications, packaging medications, medical record data entry and other duties as assigned. I hardest part of these jobs is when the phone rings all the time.  I enjoy working with my supervisor and my co-workers there. I enjoy doing my work and like my job."
good,very fast paced busy job.  you had to be good team player that takes good initiative.  very rewarding position.  CVS corporate policies were not the best.
good,"As a pharmacy technician at CVS pharmacy I am required to become an expert in receiving written prescription requests and verifying that information is complete and accurate. My primary priority as a pharmacy technician is to efficiently execute my responsibilities, which include filling prescribed medications, answering telephones, storing drugs securely, and assisting customers by answering questions.  By performing these task I expect to improve my knowledge of disposal methods and recognize management skills that influence inventory regulation. Additionally, as I execute my responsibilities I anticipate becoming familiar with appropriate interactions between pharmacists and doctors and expanding my network of professional relationships."
good,i would receive a sheet about the isle i was going to work and sometimes we would  partner up cause the isle was so long and there be about 200 products that belong to the isle.but me and my co worker had a ball they leave us alone and we get work cheering and joking i learned good team work and leadership skills
good,"I learn a lot and i like the costumer service ,the co-workers are a family,im training for training new associate,i learn for its a hardest job ,the company need the special help to co worker feel happy everyday when i return to the job,with incentives"
good,It was an ok company to work for. Lack of managerial skills is a major reason for turnover rate as well as lack of hours. Overall it is a good in between job.
good,The best part of the job is helping customers understand and comply with their medication regime with compassion. We service many older patients who need help and patience. I can rely on my coworkers to back me up on our challenging workload.
good,"A typical day was filling prescriptions, taking them from the patient, entering them into the computer, counting them and ringing out the patient."
good,its a fine place to get some experience. Ive enjoyed my time at cvs. only down fall is they don't give you enough hours to run the store.
good,"Cashier for four years at Goodwill. Put clothes up from dressing rooms, made sure clothes were hung and put out correctly for customer satisfaction, and helped train new employers. "
good,I worked in downtown so it was very busy and we didn't have enough employees to maintain the store. I learned good customer service. The management was ok but he was always frustrated and took it out on his employees. I was the only male besides my manager so i was left doing the heavy lifting all the time which isn't a problem. The Hardest part of the job was controlling a line wrapping around the whole store with only about 2 employees at the cash registers at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience and the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is challenging. You are on your feet for lengthy amounts of time. Basically your whole day. I learned that although some patients are truly sick, there are a lot of people with addictive natures; who are impatient and rude and do not apologize for these traits. Managers and co-workers alike; are clique-ish. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your professionalism, while you are being humiliated by a patient. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing some of the things you learned in school and applying some of the things you've learned from your continuing education."
good,Co-workers are the best and the work days goes by fast.  Everyday you learn something new.  Typical day at work is helping the customers with their concerns and making sure they are happy at the end of a call.
good,"CVS retail is not a realistic career for an adult. Most of the time you barely get full time hours and the pay isn't very good. Now the people you work with are great and the atmosphere is great. But as far as benefits and compensation go, I would only recommend to a younger person."
good,I had wished for more in-house training. My customers were what made my job enjoyable. My co-workers were the best. CVS is a huge company.
good,"Started with the company and the training was a bit odd, like nothing I have ever experienced before. Long story short, overall the way things were going, I did not see longevity in the company and a few months after I started an announcement was made that the company was closing  4 sites (in multiple states)."
good,"A typical day at work would log into the computer , check emails and log in  the phones... I  learned a lot about insurance benefits. The management wasn't  really supportive. You have some co-workers who are great to work around and some who had malicious and competitive characteristics. The hardest part of the job was when a patient wasn't financially able to afford the medication. Also the lunch breaks are only 30 minutes which give you little time to get food and eat . The  most enjoyable part of the job was able to learn about health care benefits."
good,Short breaks and a fast pace work place. Decent staff and pay raises decided by your work effort. not a bad place to work if you have no experience and looking to get lots of over time.
good,"Working at CVS was good, I was still training when my technician trainee expired. The things I did were: waiting on pharmacy customers and providing them with their medications, interacti ng with the Pharmacist, some computer work and keeping my area of the store clean.  I rotated with the other Pharmacy Technicians putting stock away when the store truck arrived."
good,"Not very many people I worked with at CVS were happy.  While CVS pays its pharmacists well, and their benefits are great, the work environment, and the amount of time put into the job are oppressive. Every year technician hour budgets are cut, and more work is given to the pharmacists who wind up working harder and harder for unsupportive management."
good,"I have learned a lot from working at CVS. When I originally became part of the team, I knew absolutely nothing about medicine. I have learned enough to become their lead technician in about a year of being there. I am both state licensed and nationally certified. We have a problem with co-worker respect, being on time, and being held responsible. I want to work for a company where people are required to be adults and take responsibility."
good,"Revolving door of IT support specialists, No Job security, managers are lazy and unhelpful, racial tension within the It department unprofessional environment. Should not have to worry about coming in to work and not having a job"
good,It would be great if you were treated as an employee instead of a dollar sign. A lot of turn over in employees and management. Chaotic workplace as it seems no one knows what is going on from day to day.
good,"learning experience, new career path options, good starting point for new person to be introduced to medical field, full knowledge and new learning curves"
good,CVS stresses the importance of patient care through communication.  This is a very busy position.  The company is strong on keeping staff up to date on the current training and pharmacy operating requirements.
good,"A typical day at work is kind of boring. I don't really do to much besides, greet customers, run the cash register and just the basic. I've learned to handle large amounts of money and understand the work force when dealing with retail. My co-workers help me out when they can and always give me heads up on certain things I should know. The hardest part of my job is sometimes dealing with different attitudes: however, I manage to make it through the day still smiling and being happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping other people."
good,"For the amount of work you have to do they should really pay their employees more, they also have a very high turn over rate."
good,"I liked my job because I was helping customers. I learned lot about Content management system. My coworkers are not in one office they were all over the US. I was in production support so expected to work 65 to 75 hrs a week no family life."
good,This was a fairly simple job. Made a lot of co-worker friends. It would have been better if they did not lay off my department.
good,"it was a contract job migrating computers to Windows 7. There were some obstacles, but the team was able to finish the project by everyone stepping up and working hard."
good,"Answered phones all day"
good,"loved working here, they have a program to become a registered pharmacy technician classes within their stores, nice people to work for loved the work enviroment"
good,"There expectations of their employees was unrealistic. Large task load , no other staff to help. The pharmacy manager I began with was great but lazy. The next who took over was extremely unstable and grew angry easily with technicians."
good,Tend to get lost in the large amout of employees and overlooked as well as the customer service for clients. Pay is low for the amout of time and hard work an employee puts in.
good,"I quit this job several months after working there. I was promised a position at the Panama city Beach location after training in Destin, FL. However, they didn't keep this promise and I didn't want to drive an hour to and from work everyday with the minimal pay I was receiving."
good,12 hours work days in they will firer you for being 1min later not good for people that have family also management there need to be change really bad management
good,"As for my store, it was a completely unprofessional work environment, and very negative when not in front of the customers."
good,"Great experiences, good co workers. Customers will never understand that the employees do no set the prescription prices. overall good experience"
good,"my first healthcare related paid compensation. manager was two-faced by the employees were great. scheduling could've been better. must be on time, co-worker were nice."
good,"This is a typical company that struggles in treating their employees fairly. The pay is adequate for the line of work. Recently bought out by CVS, unsure of what changes will be made."
good,My co-workers and immediate supervisors are amazing but the corporate supervisors do not care about the little people. I have enjoyed working with patients everyday and being able to help people. The hardest part is when you can't help someone and you know they need something. The pay at CVS is not competitive but it's the people that have kept me there.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at CVS pharmacy. The hardest part for me was the fast paced flow, but once you learn how the process works, its really a wonderful experience."
good,I enjoyed working at omincare but it was only a temp job I would of like to stay there I was made a team lead in the short amount of time I was there
good,"Not a bad job for a little while. Unless you are lucky it is hard to move up manly because someone has to move out."
