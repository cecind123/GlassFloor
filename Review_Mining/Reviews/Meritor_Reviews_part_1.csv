rating,review
bad,"upper management is ran by idiots, they take on projects that are way out of their league and they have no direction as a team, if you value your family time, this is not the place for you."
bad,U have supervisors who hate black people...and will make u work harder then anybody else in there...by far the worst job ever...you couldnt pay me to work there again
bad,"Meritor hires only through temporary agencies and lays them off automatically at 8 months. This company has such a high employee turnover rate, so most people did not work for this organization for more than 2 months. I was determined to make this a career move for myself.  Meritor hires through temporary agencies and lays people off right at the 8-month anniversary date to avoid paying benefits and unemployment. I was hired with the promise that I would be moved to full-time permanent status with full benefits and increased pay after my 90-day probationary period. All of performance reviews were great. However, this company never kept its promises. Other employees were made promises that the company never kept as well. Employees work on the point system, meaning if they miss so many days then they are terminated. No valid reasons are accepted by management."
bad,"Not a good place for intelligent, hard working, and loyal people. If you want to advance, they tell you there's plenty of room for advancement, just to hire external. If you can't say yes to every wish of management, say goodbye quickly. The company isn't run properly. Very poor if any, communication across departments, leading to loss of production and delivery needs not being met. If your looking for a career, this is not the place for you."
bad,Worst place ever. Favoritism is the name of the game. Not inclusive. Drug tests results get altered if you are not a favorite. Passing of the buck is the norm.
bad,Don't do it!!! Working here is equivalent to receiving government assistance. These people will have you slaving for them for bare minimal compensation.
bad,"Worst manager "
bad,Nunca ven por los trabajadores solo le importa ellos y nmas andan hay tras de uno los de seguridad pa nomas estar molestando
bad,"I work for this company twice,  They advance people based on who they like and if you’ll kiss they’re butt.  Don’t expect that you’ll get pay raises or advancement based on your knowledge or experience.  They do not know how to operate a batch company nor how to work with each department in order to build a successful process to complete a part.  Parts are constantly deviated and never held to customers print dimensions.  Stay away from this company far away."
bad,Outdated and unsafe equipment.  I wonder if they've had a month no incidents.  The 3 years I worked for the company my pay increased very slowly.  The management is awful.
bad,"The Manning, SC plant as a whole operates in an unprofessional manner to the 10th power. You never know when you will have a day off. Favoritism, nepotism, cronyism, and even sexism are openly practiced in the plant from the Plant Manager on down. A lot of the employees have personal ties to one another, therefore, you hear a great deal of unprofessional conversations. The term ""safety"" has no meaning there. The educational level of the employees, as a whole, is very low. The culture is toxic and it is cemented into the floor of the plant."
bad,"On a daily basics, I was to pack and ship brake parts through UPS Worldship and Fedex Worldship. Also had to find traveling rates for loads leaving the shipping dock. We had to make sure at all times our work area meet 5s standards."
bad,Não tem infraestrura para o funcionário realizar a demanda cobrada.
bad,"The place was extremely hot and the machines were old and constantly in a state of major repair, with some that would never be fixed for outdated parts,"
bad,Do not work here if you have a life. They(management) do not care what you have going on. They only care about their production. All that work is not worth the pay you get.
bad,work is pretty physical and pay is ****. if management doesn't like you they will do whatever they can to get to you. even if they know its completely illegal they just hope people don't know.
bad,"company closed in automotive downturn, had people reloate from michigan to loose there job, was sad.  company overall was not a good place to work for, but it was a job."
bad,"Meritor is a revolving door. They constantly find rediculous reasons to fire people. Then they turn right around scratch their heads trying to figure out why they dont have enough manpower to do their pathetic jobs. They cant put two and two together. Managers and facilitators are constantly, non-stop, trying prove their jobs. Half of them do absolutely nothing but take attendence. The other half drinks coffee. Im telling you worse job I have ever had, worst managers possible. You will be dirty, completely filthy every day. You will bust your butt and they will not appreciate it. Some manager or facilitator in there, will get the credit for your hard work and ideas. The same guy or girl that gets your credit will constantly hound you. Waiting for you to just slip up so they can pin something on you. Meritor is just one big blame game. If your not down to play the blame game, do not work here. Poor excuses for management, and really anyone else that doesnt do the actual labor. They are all out to prove a reason they should be working there. I can on and on."
bad,Pays you minimum wage for hard labor with minimal training.
bad,I left meritor to start my business. When they have someone good in a dept they dont want to let them advance.
bad,"I have been working at Meritor for going on 6 months as a temp now. There has been little to no training for the work done, everything I know has been things I either came to the place knowing, or stuff I have picked up and taught myself. I was told at first I would go full-time after 30 days, then it was 60 days, then 90. Now the company has entered a decline and are asking full-time people to take a voluntary lay off. The Management is beyond horrible and I would give less than 1 star if I could. The shifts are either 6am to 6pm or 6pm to 6am. Before the decline I was working anywhere from 5 to 10 days in a row without a day off. As you can imagine that left little time for family and things outside of work. All in all I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you are a work-a-holic."
bad,"Lack of opportunity and have a strict buddy-buddy system and it does not matter how much of a hard worker you are.if you're not well established as a suck up, you WILL NOT advance."
bad,"As a temp, I was given the worst job in the plant.  It was freezing cold  and I had to lift 70-80 gears for 12 hours straight.  I hurt my back (sciatica) and was immediately laid off with no benefits.  I was out of work for six weeks and my girlfriend left me because of it.  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!"
bad,This job does not value their employees unless you are sucking up to management. As an employee if you aspire through work alone you won't make it long. Your hard work does not pay off and they refused to hire independently. I strongly suggest any other place in Fletcher nc to find work. The only upside to meritor was the human resources department.
bad,It was horrible and don't recommend it to no one. Blah blah blah couldn't stand them rasict itches straight outta you know where. They never helped and communication sucked
bad,Work 7 days a week and managers have an issue when you ask for weekends off. Managers show blatant favoritism and let certain people get away with anything and will fire others over trivial things.
bad,"Work on an assembly line installing door handles, screws, inspecting"
bad,"The title says it all. There is no communication in any level of management!"
bad,"Har jobbat ganska många år här nu. Arbetsförhållanden blir sämre för varje år. Räkna med att bli tvingad till mycket övertid på helgerna, stress, enformigt och oergonomiskt arbete. Detta gäller speciellt för monteringsavdelningarna. Känns inte som ledningen bryr sig mycket om arbetarna utan vill bara få bättre resultat och vinst för varje år vilket innebär mer jobb utan mer lön och andra metoder som missgynnar arbetarna. "
bad,This company concentrates mostly on production numbers. Fails on quality to its customers and safety of its employees.
bad,"The pay is very nice. However, if you are hired through peak staffing, or under temporary contract. They automatically hate you. The managers will do everything in their power to get you out! They do not believe in coaching, or training. The job itself is not a bad job. The managers are horrible!"
bad,"Management sucks at Meritor. they treat people unfairly poor  work environment. Some departments  have un ending over time.  the only good place to work  at Meritor is in the offices, like customer service."
bad,Management issues and required to work to many hours and days without a day off. The job itself was good but the management expected too much out of you.
bad,This company is place to learn.Not to expect any other any other benefits from the management.Its a Joint venture Pls note it.
bad,putting parts inboxes and running a line how to be a leader and take care of things co workers are nice nothing really hard about it the co workers are nice
bad,Very heavy lifting pushing and pulling even with hoist.
bad,"I am a hard work whom comes to work everyday, I am excellent at customer service and management. Meritor does not have good management that I am willing to learn from. It is more competition then team work. I did not want to be apart of that."
bad,"Management is not fair to there employees,  hes rude and does not know how to manage his employees,  hes very passive aggressive,  you can never tell what kind of mood he is in from day to day."
bad,"They say paid holidays off but always end up working every holiday...dont get sick you dont have sick days, pay is ok but the hours worked is insane you have no life! Keep looking "
bad,"I was a ""Floater"" at my last job. I would fill in for absentees and vacation replacement as needed. Everyday I could be in a different department and job. You had to be able to learn quickly and be prepared to do jobs from Maintenance, production, machine operator, customer service in-plant, shipping/ receiving and many other positions. "
bad,"I wish I was an Employee when part of the company moved to North Carolina, I would have gone to begin a fresh start for the future."
bad,"It was a good experience, however, it wasn't the place for me. Therefore, I am looking for a new, better opportunity for me to grow within the company."
bad,"There isn't any advancement for us.  Treated poorly, all the executive assistants feel the same.  No and I mean no work life balance.  Really do not care if you are sick to them you are s number.  Sad that companies are of this nature."
bad,"Its a job but to much going on not in order at all. Lack of communcation is terrible. The never ask the employees ideas on improving work, or how to go about doing a job."
bad,Its not the job a beginner would like to have. The pay is good but you don't get benefits as a temp. The management is on the slack side job security is depending on if you are a good worker
bad,"Lies lies then more lies it's a building full of hypocrisy then they treat you like you're dirt and scrutinize everything thing you do right or wrong I have never worked for such mean heartless coworkers and managment in my life on 3rd shift, 1st shift ppl are fairly good but dont goto 3rd unless you want to regret it."
bad,I have worked at Meritor for 6 years. It is a very fast paced and it is hard labor. Meritor paid pretty good but the hours we worked was the worst for me.
bad,the work is to hard for the pay. alot of heavy stuff have to move it quickly... an i dont know why this is forcing me to reveiw meritor kinda ridiculous
bad,"Very challenging to work in aftermarket division.  Losing market share is the biggest challenges, production cost did not support to lower the sales price in unit.  Corp made a wrong decision  to  business and ended up selling that segment. Lots of turn over during that time."
bad,Was good while it lasted.  The money was nice and it was close to home.
bad,"if you want to come home everyday thinking about how terrible your job is, how much you hate your bosses and co-workers, and desire to have the life sucked out of you, get paid nothing...."
bad,The company was a good employer until they decided to shut the plant down to move the work to achieve cheaper labor elsewhere including Mexico. There were close to 300 employees with over 15 years of dedication to the company that lost their jobs.
bad,"No benefits,temporary work,hardly ever do full time hire,poor managment,poor pay for this type of  work no job security most of the employees are nice"
bad,I got Manufacting Experience from working at Meritor.I like it for what it is .I just want more
bad,"Pay was not enough for distance traveled,could have been decent long term work if had been closer to home"
bad,"Horrible place to work."
bad,"This place tells you one thing then does another, and does not perform proper safety procedures.The work you perform is not compensated in the amount you make, hours, rules and the environment change constantly...employees left to work with heavy parts with no staff or anyone around for safety measures if needed for hours at a time..."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked at!!! The management is the worst I have ever worked with. If you haven't been there for 20 plus years you don't even exist. In daily morning meetings you are lambasted in front of other managers, no one is safe no matter how good your numbers are you are still ""pathetic."""
bad,"I ran a punch-press for 8 hours. Punched rivets out of brake shoes."
bad,management sold out to mexico...lay off  permanent......without any compensation........................................i worked 3 to 11....welding and many more things.. welding certififcation and gas relight too
bad,"I was a Cost accountant and we doing the books for 4 different enties.  However, we were using 3 different packages of GL to do it.  There was no consistance with this company."
bad,They don’t want to give you your raise when you suppose to get it.  You have no life outside of work because you are always working and have no time to pay your bills
bad,"I enjoyed my position at Meritor although I felt as if the management and work environment was poor. In my position, I had to utilize skills such as attention to detail, team player, patience and math."
bad,enjoyed job people management had that good olle boy network thing  going on. as long as you said what they wanted to hear you had a job. pets and benifeits.
bad,Alot of lifting and working with alot of metal. We build tractor trailer axels for Volvo and Hino and other companies. I am currently working as a Temp to Hire.
bad,"There are some good people who work there.  I wanna give a big shout out to the homies in the maintenance department, referb, riveting, shipping, and any other homies  who are homies.  Be cool y'all."
bad,I worked in quality and they were short handed. we worked 7 days a week. The OT money was pretty good but no time off made for tired body. Fortunately I was only here for a short time.
bad,"They pay new hires WAY LESS than they used to pay new hires. They don't ever give time off. They pay all new hires the same rate, outside experience don't matter and hardness of the job you are doing don't matter. They NEVER offer incentives or say thank you. The most incentive you MIGHT get is an ice cream or a popcicle. ""Thanks for giving up your life and making us billions, have a ice cream ""."
bad,Initial interview went really well. Boss left me on shift by myself 2 weeks after I started (which was fine in itself) however the upper managment was visiting the next day and they wanted me to accomplish 3 different jobs plus mine inf 1 shift. Very laid back but lacking in management.
bad,Very fast paced company with some good people. Great benefits package (they offer a pension) but training was minimal and support from HQ in Troy was non-existent.
bad,"The work crew i was assigned built rearends for commercial trucks.  They also had crews to rebuild transmissions, differentials, brakes, and other commercial axle components."
bad,"This job is mostly a manual job, where you do the majority of the work. There are no machines to help you, just muscle. If you can move fast then this is the job for you, if not, it's best not to join this company. The benefits are great, but the pay is very low for the amount of work this job requires. The bad part about it is that there is no one to fight for the hardworking people, who work day in and day out, countless hours. The employees deserve more!!"
bad,I am no longer employed under the new management team. My position was eliminated after the company was sold.
bad,"I enjoyed my work on the main differential line and the fast pace it operated at. After learning all of the stations on the line we would rotate around the positions after every break to ensure no one would get too bored with the station they worked at. I enjoyed working as a team there. I volunteered for the safety team for the plant and made a great suggestion for taking pictures for work stations to ensure the employees knew what the work area should look like after there shift was over. I was told that my idea had been made before, but never put into action so I received no credit for my idea even though it was still not in use. I was told that I was a shoe in for the full time hire on that was coming up for my outstanding performance and dedication to improving the workplace environment. When the time came I was not even called to an office for a formal interview."
bad,"Not only is management terrible, but they make it impossible to achieve your goals without any support. The company is always ""on fire"" and everything is unorganized and unplanned. It is very hectic and not supportive of its employees. This company basically harasses their employees and there's a total boys club and super political nonsense. Myself and several others are happy to have left when we did. Borderline emotional abuse to work here."
bad,like any other company it is the people that make it a good or bad place to work. but i am not here to be a critic i am looking for a job.............
bad,"The work schedule is not something you want to devote yourself to if you have a family life. You have to work seven days a week, and maybe two days off a month. If you don't mind working 60+ hours a week, and it doesn't bother you working in extreme heat...this might be the job for you."
bad,"Facility is closed, was out of date and too expensive to keep open.  Many people were leaving because they were aware of the limited time it would stay in operation."
bad,"From the day one is hired, it is run, run, run. Insufficient training was provided. Accountability was all on the production line no matter what the situation. Overtime was a serious issue."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Meritor because of the environment. None of my coworkers were friendly and management was very detached from day to day operations. I did not receive a 3 month or 6 month review as promised in orientation. Eventually, the money wasn't a good enough reason to stay."
bad,My typical day at work was mainly a hastle. The only thing i really learned to do was put a brake together quickly. The management was horrible. My co-workers we're fun to work with and the hardest part of the job was making sure everything was put together correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch and time to leave.
bad,"One was either liked and respected or they talked behind your back, plus on occasion the management set you up for failure.  I would not recommend this place to work at all."
bad,I worked there 18 months and still didn’t get rolled over to a permanent job I was loyal to them and they ended my assignment after 18 months of loyalty and hard work
bad,"The work was hard but, I came in everyday and gave it my all. I was the only woman in the whole warehouse and I was not treated fairly by other employees."
bad,"Going in, Meritor was a fabulous place to work. I had great management support, a good salary and great benefits. From the beginning, my Plant Manager raised concerns about the upper Management's ethics. How little did I know what was coming. My plant was shut down, and most of the product line was sent to Mexico. I was laid off, recalled, and converted from a permanent employee to a contract employee with no benefits. I spent company money like it was water, which was really fun but it was to make up for an incompetent purchasing dept. I chased the supplies, and delivered them to the plants in my car. I did not get paid extra was providing this service which was expected of my position. I still owe $9000+ in auto maintenance costs. I was laid off with less than 30 days to go to be vested in the retirement plan. Other reviewers have mentioned a good ole boy network at Meritor, I don't know that it's exactly that, but management definitely has it's favorites, you can be publicly shamed in a meeting, and if you aren't one of the anointed ones, you can't work hard enough. If you are still going to work there, make it a short to medium term endeavor, and then move on before they have a chance to put you behind the eight ball."
bad,the culture was a machine shop with hard working people and hard character traits.  was mostly a good place to work if you could endure a toxic union and management relationship.
bad,"Unrealistic performance expectations are common.  A person can only work so fast and remain accurate.  Even if you throw accuracy out the window, a body can only move so fast.  Extremely stressful trying to meet those expectations every day, particularly when you have supervisors literally and repeatedly leaning over your shoulder asking if you're done yet.  One production department was repeatedly required to work 7 days/week for several weeks in order to meet production deadlines. They weren't given a choice."
bad,"I would get to my booth and see what parts had been sent to me the previous day. I might start with wheels or calipers. Management had very lousy communication about their expectations. They were more reactionary than pro-active. My co-workers were great, I really liked the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was how management would change things too often. Things like proper procedures or not giving me proper instructions on how to do my job. The things i enjoyed most were my coworkers, having my own semi-secluded booth to work in and how they would give us free lunch from time to time."
bad,Run your assigned machine to produce needed product. Making the machine run is only the start of turning quality parts. Setting up the machine the proper way eases the stress on not only you but also the next operator. On the other hand being moved all over without knowing what you're running adds stress. If you treat your people like dirt that shows in the production numbers too. Thankfully other operators are quick to jump in and help.
bad,"They were Bought out many times since Arvinmeritor, now the french own them and commutation is very poor and they communicate about silly things"
bad,The pay and benefits are competitive. Plant manager is good but the one under him over production is horrible. They work a lot of overtime and don't have much time off
bad,"falta de comunicação e descaso com funcionário. supervisor confia demais na liderança dos setores que acabam fazendo oque eles querem, fui demitido injustamente, com acusações mentirosas de um lider."
bad,"The company is no longer innovating and is instead using old ideas (weight reduction, decontenting) to create new products, even though advances there are already asymptopically limited."
bad,"I worked along with a lot of employees as a contract employee. My contract was terminated when I revealed that I would be having some medical issues which required me to take a 5 week leave of absence. "
bad,"Work is generally 8 hours a day, 40 hour week.  Roles are clear cut, and work is very regimented.  There are management cliques, and if you don't get into one, you will be shuffled out the door pretty quick.  Don't rock the boat with observations about how you have seen things done differently for better results - it will not be appreciated.  The Indianapolis plant is just west of the airport.  It is divided up into brake shoe re-manufacturing for truck size drum brakes, and axle-differential-transmission re-manufacturing for large diesel trucks.  The plant burns old paint and road grime off of used brake shoes, and later repaints them using an electrostatic process.  The particulates in the air often leave a blue gray haze in the ceiling area 40 feet overhead.  It smells pretty bad too.  Unless you want to breathe that - don't plan on staying long."
bad,"This job was fast paced, which I enjoy but the environment was hot and there was not much attention to safety, although it was taught. There was plenty of opportunity for overtime, but not optional."
bad,The company is a great place to grow.  The pay is ok. They have frequent layoffs. Most people stay if they dont get laid off.
bad,"I enjoyed the people and facilities at Meritor They need a bit more communication on daily task and workloads, but management is verry accessible, The pay is exceptional for work performed"
bad,This company was good. Most of the time every company has its lows and highs. Its the character and the integrity that makes great companies. When you have people of excellent spirit then your company will be great.
good,"Trabalho é rotineiro. Aprendi as relações humanas e contribuí para a empresa.A DIREÇÃO E A GERÊNCIA / AUTOCRÁTICA, NÃO RESPEITA A PERSONALIDADE DOS COLABORADORES E NÃO DEIXA OS OPERADORES DESENVOLVEREM EM CURSOS OU FACULDADE. O horário muda constantemente e a submissão é total para empresa.A cultura é da década de 50. A parte difícil são os excesso da gestão. A MAIS AGRADÁVEL, AS VERDADEIRAS AMIZADES."
good,Its a very small company but very diverse which is a plus because you get to learn a lot about other cultures. Also by the company being small they work as one big family team.
good,I love the people I work work but I could excel I want to grow with the company and fast learner
good,"constant work as a quality control personnel ,i learned how to inspect truck axels for components n welding cracks etc.,had a good work environment wit coworkers n supervisiors , hardest part of the job was working 12hr shifts for 7 days straight for a month , i enjoyed working n learning new job qualifications"
good,management will not help you when you ask.  you are blowing of when you ask management about something or even try to tell them something.  the culture is changing and no one cares.
good,plenty of opportunity for growth within the company but since this was a supplier for the auto industry it was unpredictable with lay offs throughout the year.
good,"I got alone well with my fellow employees, however once hired full time from temp, management treated me differently. The employees were like family, but there was a constant turn over with management. While there it seemed as though management played favorites'."
good,"A company that does not look to advance people from within. Co-workers are highly unmotivated because of how management treats them. "
good,"Excellent company for company mission, benefits, and compensation. Work environment is stressful and off hours are not regarded as your own. an immense amount of overtime is required."
good,"The main problem was that I was part time for 6 months, knew almost every job on the assembly line, and I was told I wasn’t valuable enough for full time. The pay was awful for the work we were doing. There was no benifits, insurance, no paid holiday or vacation."
good,Having to build 28 -32 S-Cam brake systems an hour under those conditions is extremely difficult and stressful. That job stresses the home life out and creates anxiety
good,Not much room for advancement. Didn't see management to often. Extremely dirty job. Very hard work and sometimes really fast paced. I learned to train on other jobs to help the line out.
good,"I worked here for 9 years and it was very stressful work environment. Internal and external customer needs are pushed to working level to be completed even when not possible,"
good,Company has super low Denison Consulting Score for Employee engagement and Empowerment 1 of 5 but claimed it uses Six Sigma for > 20 years.  Very high turn over rate.  Nice people but intimidated and afraid of losing their job.
good,I would come in an hour early to get everything set up for the day. I loved to be on the floor with my employees and I think they liked it also. I spent half of my day in the office doing paper work.
good,The hardest part of the job when supervising was when there was different nationalties that did not speak English.
good,"Face pace place only about the numbers. Which is very understandable if pay compensated the work environment. Learned some different things, very easy learning curve. Management, it seemed they worked against you. Without the co-workers to uplifting one another it would be very dry. But management would stop that. Nothing hard just continuous physical work non stop. Most enjoyable part of the job would most definitely be the co-workers at hand."
good,"Be there at 550 AM, you go through your shift meeting then you go to the assembly line. Depending on your job depends on how hard you work I was putting shafts in the axles which weigh from 10-60 lbs you also have to coat the axle in what is on the tag."
good,"Empresa con mucha seguridad,así como cuidadosa de sus bienes"
good,The job is very fast paced and can be stressful .I have worked for this company as a temp and desire to bring my skills to a full time position that offers room for advancement.
good,lo que mas me gusto el compañerismo en el puesto de trabajo.hacer puertas y elevalunas para seat
good,When they hire you it's all about working your way up and becoming part of the team and safety first. But afterwards you start to see that it's not about safety it's about numbers. They say take your time and don't rush but it's really hurry hurry hurry. No respect for new people.
good,El ambiente es bueno y el trabajo en equipo es exelente ya que los Operadores trabajan en conjunto para lograr las metas establecidas.
good,Grateful for the opportunity. good company with many needs for improvement. Weak management team. Overtime is always available as there are multiple shifts.
good,-Fun place to work but in terms of who to go to when working on a project is very difficult and is hard to ever get something implemented.
good,"Mucho trabajo y es muy bueno, informacion disponible para todos, salario regular, en ocasiones estress debido a la presion de produccion pero tolerable, buen ambiente de trabajo y compañerismo."
good,"Challenging job, always things to fix and improve. People very protective of their job. Cross training difficult because people felt threatened. Normal manufacturing enviromant but people not as open and friendly as others. Not a familt atmosphere. Everyone is professional but no time for home life balance during these years not sure how it is now."
good,"It's a very repetitive job and doesn't offer a variety of tasks, you do the same thing over and over for your entire shift, every day. I enjoyed being around the people that I worked with. They, as well as management, were always nice and respectful."
good,The day went pretty fast and I liked the job alright. Too many hours to work in a week. I left for less hours only to have been laid off at the new job after 2 weeks. Should have stuck it out because now I have no income.
good,I wouldn't advise it if you have low patience. It's pretty unfair how they treat people. Make them do 2 3 man jobs by themselves and drag there feet on the pay scales.
good,"I worked on the machining line ""deburring"" industrial truck axles. The work was very repetitive and monotonous and the pay did not properly reflect the amount of work required. Management was great but we were routinely required to work weekends."
good,"The renovation of one of their buildings into a more modern, open landscape with short cube walls and a general, centered meeting area with glass door meeting rooms around it was a nice start.  However, the older, three story building attached has some work to be done to match.  Its pretty close- quartered in that building when it comes to people and their work stations."
good,The plant I was employed at closed. The management did not work with its employees. There was a huge division between hourly employees and salary employees. Work environment was stressful
good,"Had a chance to work on a variety of different systems and suppliers, Ability to travel to different countries and diversity of products."
good,"aprendi mucho "
good,"set-up, operate lathe, inspect parts, route to next operation or ship.  trouble shoot non-conformance operations in machining, write continuous improvements on findings turn in to management."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of retrieving, packaging, and sorting material from a assembly line. I learned how to be both efficient and effective while doing my work. I built trust with my co-workers which allowed them to depend on me. The hardest part of my job was having to lift up to 100 pounds on occasionally. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the opportunity to speak my thoughts and beliefs at meetings and seeing that they were considered to make my job easier."
good,Great place to work. Although very hard to get raises and there are not very many opportunities of being hired on full time. pay really isn't that competitive and underpaid for same job as a regular employee
good,Management had very little regard for the employees. The management there were petty and vindictive. You were told one thing by one person and something very different from someone else. They couldn't seem to get on the same page. They would preach moral ethics to the hourly people but lack to abide by the same guidelines.
good,did the same thing every day. pay wasn't great. I like to be challenged and i was not getting that here.
good,"Typical day for me at work would include changing of tasks throughout the day, I have learned many skills such as: forklift operation, proficiency in computer programs AS400 and Marc System, I've also learned valuable team-building skills as well as communication skills."
good, good place if your not a temp.. if your full time then you can receive all the benifts as a temp you dont get anything except vacation but dont get that til after a year of being there
good,"I would recommend Meritor as a company, especially if you are looking for a challenging work place; It is very results driven but good work life balance depending on group."
good,"Meritor is an excellent company in reference to it's corporate goals, benefits and compensation. There was no distinguishing between work hours and off time. I worked EVERY weekend and almost every night for 2 years.  I covered the duties of 3 Senior Chemists for that entire length of time. Extremely high stress environment."
good,The job was good for what it was needed. But after new people came and did what they wanted. They didn't stay long at all. They wanted us to disassemble around 45 axles a day. That's hard when you don''t have a whole team working like their supposed too.
good,"Meritor is a deplorable working environment, ran by people whose interests is more in line with the directives that come down the pipeline than their own morality. decent pay."
good,This is a decent place to work just be ready to work plenty of overtime and hours but the pay is good just a hot fast pace environment but overall not that bad
good,The company has made zero investments in equipment.  So most days were spent keeping machines running.  Management has been very unstable but could always improve.  The people at the plant are the best to work with and I will miss them.  The hardest part of my day was struggling to get parts ordered to keep machines running.  The benefits are decent if you can stay long enough to be vested.  The company does not seem to care about the people.
good,"I was a security officer for just over four years at ArvinMeritor. Though it was not what you would describe as an exciting job, I found that most of the people you interact with made the day/job, very enjoyable."
good,Good opportunity to learn but a with a very heavy work load.  The people are nice but there is room for more support from management to boost morale and create a better work/life balance.
good,"My typical day at Meritor consisted of assessing production needs and moving manpower as needed to meet the particular needs of each customer for that day.  I performed weekly safety audits and daily process audits to ensure the integrity of all parts going to the customer.  I would notify and follow up with maintenance with any down equipment and assist on repairs when needed to minimize downtime.  I would perform hourly checks with operators to troubleshoot any and all issues that the operators would encounter that would inhibit safety, quality, or production."
good,This job has no advancement oportunities. The people there come in everyday do the same job and leave. You are not required to work over time ever.
good,"The people were fantastic to work with - seemed like family rather than coworkers.  People supported one another & were willing to pitch in for the common good of the company."
good,well to start its hot and the jobs weren't hard but continues no rotations and pretty tough
good,Load lines with products to make brake shoes. Then inspect each brake shoe made. I learned alot from the more expierenced workers to do my job better. The management was ok not to much in the way
good,"Gestão de contas estratégicas, prospeção e desenvolvimento de novos negócios, relacionamento e negociação com tomadores de decisões dos clientes."
good,"2 days a month you can work from home, flexible schedules and team oriented environment."
good,Weld and assembly parts together . Very fast pace . Average working environment.
good,"I spent about a year working at Meritor as a temp.  They pay decently, starting off at nine dollars an hour.  But my job required me to be in good physical shape for me to do what needed to be done."
good,"Boss asked me everyday if I liked my job. "
good,"En esta empresa comencé como pasante  durante los meses donde estuve cambio de firma de ser arvinmeritor a ser encontechnologies y luego paso a ser Faurecia.En el medio sacaron el programa de pasantes por lo que mi contratación acabó "
good,This company was ok to work for. Not great in compensation and stability. The people was ok to work with. I wouldn't go back to work for this company.
good,Environment was fair. Lack of communication sometimes of employees shift change. Promised a full time position and never received. Temporary doing everything to be done. Was not treated accordingly about the job position.
good,Set schedule. Typical day was clock in go to work station do job clock out. Moved to varying work stations depending on need. Diverse work environment
good,Great place for new grads to get a career start! The Company put a lot of faith and trust in me which pushed me to succeed. They also focused on cross-training and tried to move employees around the Company.
good,"able to run all 22 positions on the assembly line, inspect all axles, rebuild and repair all defective axles that come off the line. load and unload trailers ."
good,I enjoyed working at meritor and engaging into my learning experience to make my job more sustainable for me and my coworkers around me. It was a great learning new things
good,"Fast-paced"
good,I'd love to still be working for Meritor. Unfortunately my job was outsourced and they left town. It was an awesome place to work where I enjoyed going to work every single day.
good,the place is ok for start up and not for serious carrier oriented. lot of contingent engineers are being taken against few for onboard. very limited groeth.
good,"The work place is ok to start your carrier.There are few campus recruitments for freshers, which is good to start up their carrier, but not to stay long or being stuck is not good."
good,The job its self was decent I dont like the fact of taking alot of breaks makes the day go to  slow Im a person that likes to work until the shift is over
good,Learnt a lot during that period that amplify my skill set. Management and team environment is always motivating you to work at your best in order to add value to the company
good,"I have not worked there in over 20 year so I am definitely no the right person to ask,  The company has changed ownership numerous time since I have been gone."
good,"Did not plan to make this a career move, being a small town made the job move at the time for the pay.  Factory work is not what i am looking for in my new career adventure."
good,"Pros"
good,"un buen ambiente de trabajo , así como el personal que ahí labora , solo que  la empresa no cuenta con las herramientas suficientes para el desarrollo de sus proyectos ........"
good,"Responsable del área de Tratamientos Térmicos, Hornos de Carburizado, Revenido, Prensas para temple, robot Gantry, así como también reportes y check list diarios en áreas de producción, mantenimientos preventivos, predictivos, y correctivos en área, al igual que maquinaria CNC, fanuc corte y tornos C50, torres enfriamiento, compresores y sistemas de tratamiento de agua."

good,"Pas de commentaire à fournir c'était il y a 10ans."
good,"Okay to work at was in the tool room,management needs a little work.co workers ar great to work with.I was in the tool room love my job there was fun to work there"
good,hard work is the word at this plant.managers are serious about production but fair about accomplishing the daily production goals.
good,This position was a contract position which was only to last a week.  It lasted 3 days because the inventory data entry was completed.
good,Meritor has amazing benefits and the pay is average.  Working there requires a lot of over time. My job requires I work every other weekend sometimes both Saturday and Sunday.
good,"This is a great Company to work for, good benefits, great vacation package"
good,"To be the recognized leader in providing advanced drivetrain, mobility, braking and aftermarket solutions for the global commercial vehicle and industrial markets"
good,"Required you to work in a prison, high tension from inmates and staff, management not to keen on your ideas just there's.  I learned to keep calm in hostile situations, and to manage my time with staff and inmates better.  Co-workers were not team players, so I did learn to adjust with there ideas to a point and caution on the side of safety.  The hardest part was you (staff) were isolated from the actual headquarters, and not able to participate in Town Hall meetings and other activities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving the prison at the end of shift."
good,"foram duas partes que vivenciei nesta empresa ,a primeira foi na usinagem e a outra no tratamento térmico,a primeira foi boa pois ja conhecia o tipo de trabalho a ser executado ja na outra parte não havia trabalhado e não me adaptei."
good,Good company with great employees.  Focused on bottom line and keeping the company profitable.
good,"Prepare To Get Dirty"
good,Every day i go in at 4am and manage 4-8 assembly lines. I perform maintence when needed.
good,"Bra arbetskamrater, bra arbetsledare,intressanta arbetsuppgifter"
good,"It's an ok place to work, but not a lot of communication between the workers and supervisors"
good,Productive workplace.  Good pay and benefits.  Decent working conditions.
good,this was a fast pace job that help to me to get experience with the car manufactor &production
good,"Good place to work, hard work but enjoyable. People are awesome, management too. Built tractor trailer axels and brake hubs. Heavy lifting and quick pace."
good,They like to work u 7 days a weak.Missed 4 hours of work they let me go.Had six days vacation they wouldnt let me take.
good,A typical day would be running orders for shipment and finding bad parts. I learned to keep up with productiuon and working in a team environment and find humor in stressful situations. my co-workers and management were very professional and expected great work ; as we all did.
good,"Shift started out with daily meeting, productions requirments for the day, any questions we needed answered or concerned, and streches. The management was an awsome group of people who always had time for any of your concerns whither it was personal or work related, everyone worked together as a team, the hardest part of the job for me was being able to lift the weight of the product which was to much for me to continue with employement there, i have suggested to several people seeking employment to apply there."
good,Typical day sometimes slow due to technical problems. I learned to use multiple air powered hand tools. I also learned how to work in a fast paced environment. I got along with all my co-workers
good,"Working at Arvin Meritor was fine, the only problem that I had with the company was the Supervisor she didn't know how to use correct Grammar, she used slang. I beleive in working in a large company like Arvin Meritor you have to be able to work in a Profesional Enviroment using the proper language and grammar, where your fellow employees can understand that we are working in a work place with quality and prodution so it should be professional.."
good,"Great learning experience as well as learning new jobs ,and a lot of chances to move up and better your career i loved working for meritor I learned about car shafts"
good,"Nada tenso, relajado, competitivo, comedor gratis."

good,"Lots of opportunities to learn about all facets of the aftermarket business including brands, distribution operations, reman operations, sales, customer service and more."
good,"its not a terrible place to work but it could us some work in certain areas just like anyother company. i enjoy working with most of the people there. i ultimately like what i do. there are times it can be frustrating but that's any job you get. i've learned that no matter how hard or easy the job your doing is don't quit don't give up. ive learned to be more open minded and patient. a typical day would be to clock in go to the morning meeting and find out what line i'm on for the day and check the axels, wheelends,componants and paper work."
good,"This is a good company to work for. I left due to limited advancement opportunities. If you work in Troy, MI there are plenty of opportunities, otherwise it's hit and miss."
good,Very fast paced environment.  No room for advancement.  Very hot and dirty place to work.  Management was not on the production floor very much they spent most of the time in the office
good,The management tends to be slower at making decisions and there are several layers of approvals required to support full execution and deployment of new projects
good,"Excelente relación con subordinados, libertad para trabajar, capacitación constante"
good,"Meritor was a job where you couldn't really enjoy any time off because you never know when you had to work. The work there was stressful especially on the assembly line because it was like if one person wasn't doing there job the right way it looked like none of y'all were. The hardest part of the job was coming across something wrong after all of the parts were built because that mean every last part had to be torn down and we made like 1400 a day. The breaks were really short to say we had to work hard every second that we are working for 10 hours and what I mean about working hard I mean fast literally fast because the moment to slow down or even try to rest you would never hit production , that was the quickest way out the door."
good,"This company is a great company to work for, there's steady growth and opportunities for learning. The work from home option is very convenient and nice!"
good,"Meritor would be an awesome place if they didn't rely heavily on Temp/contract workers to keep their numbers low.  "
good,I started as machine operator and worked many different position though out my time there. Plenty of room for advancement if a person had the desire to do so.
good,The job and goals were good. The advancement opportunities were slim.
good,"Not a bad place to work, Management worked well with emploees to get the job done."
good,"Supported plant manager in a very small plant in Tennessee. There was approximately 30 employees. I assisted with HR, purchasing and admin functions. Co-workers were fun."
good,I only spent a few months there as I was an intern as such do not have as good of a view as employees that have spent more time there
good,"Plant closed down after 60+ years. Work went to right-to-work states, non-union plants and overseas. I learned a lot of different jobs throughout my 22 years in this manufacturing plant. Everything from assembly, CNC machining, customer service, quality inspection, to fork lift driver."
good,"As with all global automotive companies, the potential for a 24 hour day is there in certain organizations. The people have always been a good group to work with and there are of opportunities to be successful."
good,"This a global automotive company with Centres at many location. The core electronics is located at Bangalore, Sully sur Loire - France and Zhenjiang China."
good,It was fun working here because it built my people skills and leadership skills.
good,Ambiente muito participativo e cooperativo. Ótima interação entre todas as áreas. Não há política de promoção e desenvolvimento de carreira.
good,"Good Management, learn to take decisions, and assign priorities."
good,This particular period was one of ethics and values struggles in an environment of right-sizing the entire industry
good,There really wasnt a lot to enjoy while at work. It was all about getting parts out as fast as u can. Management had no reguard for there employees. Benifits were good. The job is physically demanding which is fine but when the plant heats up and it almost 110 degrees inside it make is rather difficult.
good,It's a very fast pace environment. Always must have your safety gear since your dealing with huge truck parts like the Ackles and other parts. Short lunch breaks
good,"Complete lack of work ethic. Typical large manufacturing/union relationship.  Management wanted employees to do more, and union thought that members were doing enough."
good,trabajo demasiado facil. categorias demaciado bajas.cuenta con transporte. y comedor con subsidio
good,"Muito agradável, grandes desafios, contato com equipe nos EUA e Europa."
good,"The benefits are great but are being chipped away at. 2 tier pay scale, I hired on in 2007 before the pay rate was dropped. Those hired in 2009 or later make considerably less. Current production manager is driving moral down. Supervisors & team leads are stepping down or considering quitting. He is rude and disrespectful. I enjoy the work when, it's a good place to learn a variety of skills. I've learned quite a bit about safety management and lean manufacturing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the actual work. The hardest part of the job is keeping management happy."
good,"us as a team were not able to help to be a team, old school workers would not assist new hire..shift hour were good, hardest part of work when picking was to make sure the packers were honest.."
good,"i like to work their,..but disturb with its over all environment,I am working as a project manager.But the company doesnt have friendly environment"
good,"Excelent experience, work and be a leader for more than 3,000 co workers, and every day give the best of me and my team for help each firefithers life was good."
good,The work was enjoyable and I loved my daily duties. But management failed to give direct orders and hardly ever came to work. There no air/heat in the building and during the summers it was quite hot.
good,Learned alot about the automotive industry during my employment and gained a deeper understanding of how important my job was to the safety of the consumers.
good,ArvinMeritor was an average place to work.  While I worked there I unfortunately affected by the smell in the workplace and became sick frequently.  My lungs were frequently congested by the smell in the workplace.  Since I have left there this location is no longer there.
good,Aprendi a ter uma Boa comunicação a trabalhar em grupo e a parte agradavel e o horario de trabalho
good,I actually really loved working for Meritor. It felt like family to me. I loved what I did and learned so much here as well. Meritor is where I learned the fundamentals of being a Manager and running production lines. There was really no hard part of my job there. It was very Excel based and I loved it.
good,If your gonna work here. Be ready for holidays and weekends at the plant. You can make 100k but no home life. I spent 7 yrs here and had to walk away because of poor management. Nobody wants to work84 hrs a week for months on end. But if you need to cath up on bills this is your place.
good,"I did not work for Meritor , we where a contract company. "
good,Respective & Professional Culture. I am working this company from last more than six and half year and learn a new things. Good to mid level career..all the best.
good,"Driving parts to a running line, ordering arts/inspecting parts, also inspecting axles before leaving the plant, Assembly"
good,The new CEO is making very short sited decisions to positively impact the investors but long term strategy for business growth and longevity is scarce
good,they ran they a slave ship at this company. the pay made it worth it.                                             k                                                                                   .
good,"el trabajo es bueno lo que se realiza "
good,"80% del tiempo es de alta exigencia, excelente empresa para conocer los procesos y trabajar con personal"
good,"As a co-op was given hands on experience that led to better understanding of the company.  Does not have a lot of culture, but the people are all very nice."
good,"It was great working in Meritorious Central College. I learned a lot, which I definitely will use in my future career. The institution was run by my friend's cousin. The environment was friendly and worth teaching."
good,Empresa com facil acesso onde mesmo teria acesso tive muito aprendizado  as pessoas que trabalham era muito agradaveis
good,"Men kon zelfstandig werken, zoals het opzetten van een uitwijkprocedure, de varantwoordelijheid daarover werd gedelegeerd."
good,"se trabaja sin presiones , al menos en el puesto que yo tenia, buena comunicacion con superiores"
good,"Moneys there if you wanna work, overtime handed out like candy. Fast paced, gotta be able to keep up. People are alright, push numbers but preach safety and quality. 6/10 for a career choice once your in your in."
good,I was a full time co-op looking to gain experience in my field and Meritor helped me do that. They were a very fair and flexible company and provided me with skills to improve my work experience in my field.
good,"Nice workplace environment;"
good,Hard to get hired in full time. And top out way to soon. Not a real amount of time for family life when you work 7 days a week. Good job for a single person.
good,"The Meritor York plant was nice place to work, however with the new management (Quality Director at Cooperate, new Quality Manager and new Plant Manager), the atmosphere became poisonous. The log working hours and no respect of employee.  The management failed to support the quality department and customer stratification suffered a great deal."
good,"I worked in the finance department and I loved it up there. Everyone was friendly for the most part. However, those in production downstairs have it kind of rough. When production request is up then expect to work weeks in a row without a day off but if production is down always be prepared that being laid off is a possibility. Other than that it's a pretty"
good,"Porém uma politica de permanecer com os funcionários mais antigos  e até aposentados , e com os que foram contratados em contrato por prazo determinado que foi meu caso , a empresa preferiu dispensar uns 90 por cento mesmo esses mesmos funcionários tendo se empenhado tanto."
good,"Was hired on part time as a temp, no benefits so no insurance was available. Close to home , when job started coming to end had to look for something else."
good,"Boa empresa, se preocupa com o bem estar dos funcionários,oferece plano de saúde que a meu ver é um diferencial muito importante."
good,"Overall this was good place to work, small firm with a close knit work force I would have stayed here if it hadn't had closed down,due to nature of work it was always hot"
good,"Trivs bra på jobbet ingen dag är den andra lik. Började som produktionsledare på bakaxel avdelningen och hade då en personalstyrka på ca 140 personer. Efter ca3,5 år blev jag erbjuden att ta över en annan avdelning (med ca 20 personer)på företaget som inte gick så bra. Och jag tackade ja till denna utmaning, har lyckats med att lyfta denna avdelning från ca 55% OEE TILL ca 90% på ett år och där ligger vi nu stabilt."
good,"Very stressful, mad targets, constantly changing management, new priotities each day. great co-workers, lots of varied work lots of room for progression."
good,"Bom lugar para se trabalhar, porém possui um ambiente fabril de risco e horários de trabalho puxados."
good,Interesting place to work. I learned a lot from coworkers and management. There many different personalities in the facility and that made for some fun times as well as awkward times. I enjoyed my time and lessons learned while working there.
good,"A Meritor é considerada uma das empresas melhores para se trabalhar. Em um dia tipico de trabalho o ambiente é agradável mas porém também tem pressão como toda empresa. "
good,I worked in the paint booth. I had to use a Hoist to move truck axles into the paint booth to be able to paint them. I learned how to use a Hoist and also how to use a paint gun. The hardest part of the day was when we got behind and we had to try and catch up really fast. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing that we met out goal for the day.
good,"j'ai travaillé dans plusieurs services avec contact avec des ingénieurs et la direction "
good,Meritor was a well run company. There were two parts to the factory. Machining and assembly. I worked in assembly. I also helped the Quality Department write Work Instructions conforming to ISO 9000.  The company focused on Quality and Safety. Any issue you could take to management and it would be addressed.
good,Nice place to work. Great job security. Pay and hours arent that great but its an ok job.
good,Meritor Wabco would be more of an ideal job if they didn't hire only temporary workers and kept a solid work force crew. Minimum wage for close to 40 hours or more a week is not ideal. Co-workers came and go according to business needs.
good,I would clean the restuarant prepare meals for the customers as well provide excellent service.
good,"Arvin Meritor was a very challenging job, but I like challenges. Although it took some getting used to, it turned out to be a pretty good job."
good,El ambiente laboral era bueno se podria decir que todos llevabamos una buena relacion
good,There are a lot of unnecessary changes that happened at this job  and for the most part it causes frustration with coworkers training system was low as well I was the only trainer they had
good,"This is a really cool company they have had their ups and downs financially but the moral is good there, the people are friendly and they have updated the work areas to make it a cool environment to work in."
good,Friendly people and management but was just seasonal work so for that reason the hourly wage wasn't adequate for someone trying to raise a family of 4
good,when robots go down have to trouble shot but other than that job runs pretty smooth . The manager and leads are great to work for .The temp to hire process sucks bc your benifits and raise get held ova your hard.
good,"Visited a lot of Corporate Companies, attended seminars, studied/investigated technical issues on Meritor Axles, Imparted training Programs."
good,Fast-paced team environment with flexibility in schedule if working in a salaried position.  The most difficult part of the job was the long hours that my job entailed.
good,good place to work - moved much further away from home and I followed the company.   wish they never moved so far away from my home when they relocated operations.
good,"Fun place to work.  Lots of people willing to help and train."
good,"Learn too much in this company .. Thank for the great team work.............."
good,Company management was flexible and allowed for individual initiative. Lots of changes during my time there and interesting assignments.
good,"Good to know your providing nationwide service.  American drivers are next to these shippers everyday, 18 wheelers driving back and forth from destination to destination with parts that make up the 18 wheeler.  Picking truck parts."
good,Opportunistic atmosphere for skills achievement in a globally owned and operated corporation that is provisional on a permanent or temporary basis initially via temporary agency only for an undetermined number of years by global and corporate management worldwide in order to facilitate adequate employee-job matches terminable at any given time via collective managerial opinion polls.
good,Funcionários dispostos a ensinar e incentivar a busca por novos conhecimentos
good,"I worked as an intern so i was enjoying learning lots of new things like about bogie, doors , pneumatic system(braking), types of lines, cars, etc."
good,Empresa bem localizada facil acesso as pessoas eram bem educadas o servico era bem facil de se lidar
good,"Non è tutto oro quello che luccica, a fronte di tanto lavoro c'è la scelta dei responsabili commerciali di sacrificare il profitto aziendale a vantaggio della loro carriera, falsificando i dati e a volte svendendo il prodotto."
good,De part la diversite des taches a accomplir apporte une grande experience
good,Really enjoyed working there. The people were the best. Very dangerous place to work though
good,"It is good experience in arvinmeritor in my short tenure."
good,"Uma empresa sólida e agradavel de se atuar, tendo planos de carreira, onde dignifica ainda mais o colaborador."
good,"evaluacion , buena aunque esperaria mas ... de la empresa "
good,la societe a fermee les portes ... si j aurai bien voulu faire carriere avec vw malheureusement on etait une bonne equipe tt et
good,"Start up shift ,everything was organized and in place I learned how to assemble brakepads very quickly ,all of the employers got alone very well with each other ,managment team was very courteous and polite their was no hard part about the job,most enjoyable part was I really like the atmosphere and doing the work itself."
good,"Great benefits, do your work and show up on time everyday and you will have a 40+ hr job forever. It does lack proper ventilation, it gets super smokey from burn off ovens and it is REALLY dusty/dirty. I cleaned inside all of my toolbox drawers when I started and within a few months everything was coated with a 1/8th inch of dust! But it's a great career place"
good,Some locations for this company are better than others. I have worked or regularly visited in multiple locations within the company. The corporation would be better if all locations were treated equally.
good,Meritor is serving the heavy trucking industry with solid engineering and innovative ideas.  I have been privileged to be a member of this organization that allowed me to make humble improvements to their lubrication technology platform.
good,Meritor was a great experience for me . I a great job for new graduates to go to because it helps you push to do better in any work place you go . The only bad thing was the hours and not having time to yourself.
good,You were working in a very dirty place the pace is up and you will learn how to be very responsible. A typical day consisted of meetings and safety checks. The culture was very diverse.
good,This was a great place to work.  I unloaded trucks with a forklift and did all the receiving paperwork.  It was a very responsible position. I enjoyed my time there.
good,Great company to work for with good benefits. Lot of people with 10 plus years of seniority shows that people are satisfied with the company.  The only con is that there is not much career advancement.
good,meritor is a nice place to work. The company encourages employees to be involved in the community. It encourages all employee involvement and stressess safety and quality.
good,Meritor was good to me while i worked there. The work was steady untill i got laid off.  They tried ti keep moral up the best they could.  Unfortunately getting full time was difficult.
good,"I have officially worked with Peak Workforce Solutions, it is rather difficult to get them to move you to a alternative position within their work force."
good,Meritor is a good company to work for in that there is flexibility and no micro managing.  I am very disappointed that our tax department is being outsourced to a public accounting firm.  The past year our group has worked diligently to incorporate new software and processes and procedures that we will never know how well they would have worked.
good,"This place has amazing management. Stern but fair; patient; always making sure everyone is okay and working safely. "
good,Ambiente seguro e empresa que foca na cultura da qualidade.
good,"i simply njoyed working here. management is very transparent"
good,"Durante o período em que trabalhei, aprendi muito, conheci e apliquei todo o conhecimento de redes e Telecom."
good,"En cuestión a ingeniería la mayoría de las maquinas son muy recientes se puede aprender bastante y están en optimas condiciones. "
good,"The one thing that's remarkable at Meritor is you always get a chance to advance but that's only in jobs. It's not in the company itself. They have great benefit's,but that's only for the employee's who are officially apart of the company.Most of the time that company play's favortism and for all of the wrong reason's. But I now know that that is the very reason that they have been going this long. So don't get me wrong it's a good company to work for,but it's not for everyone wether your a hard worker or not if they don't want you they'll use you for a little while and then when they don't need you,your gone. That's Meritor"
good,Early 7am start 40 hours a week team leaders was awesome people to work with enjoy job
good,"O modelo inovador de fabricação de caminhões e ônibus se destaca, fazendo com que a empresa seja referência nacional no segmento."
good,"Conducted sales presentations and provided service in assigned district (AR, Western KS, OK, and TX Panhandle).  "
good,Great company with lots of potential. Pleasure to work with everyone.
good,"Foram mais de 3 anos na empresa, pude vivenciar experiencias na minha área de formacao, desenvolvi atividades de uma multinacional e isso foi muito valido para a minha carreira profissional."
good,"mucha presion , contacto con transportistas experienci en embarques y en almacen, comañeros buenos capases responsables, cierres de mes, buen horario y tiempo extra."
good,"It has been a long time since I've worked here. Just let it be said, if this company had not fallen on hard economics, I would still be there!"
good,"Inventory, Check-in, Customer Satisfaction, Oracle receiving, Auto crib data."
good,Mandatory over time. 7 days a week.
good,The workplace environment was a great experience. There was definitely a teamwork atmosphere. The management was always helpful and provided technical advise on processes.
good,"High pressure, fast paced environment.  The level of expectation is high, and the staff work together to maintain high standards.  Great deal of accountability."

Tive o reconhecimento de meus superiores."
good,This is the job that I decided to leave after 5 years because things were not looking well after the Meritor buyout. This place felt like family and was very flexible with home life.

The hardest part is when operators don't agree but with open communication it is worked out. All these things made my job enjoyable.  "
