rating,review
bad,I worked for great plain for a little over a year in the Saint clairsville office but when canton messed up all their work up there they decided. to lay us off so they could bring them guys down my supervisors were awesome but the big bosses they suck they costed over 50 people there job when in reality all the canton guys should have gotten laid off
bad,"It is clear that that Chesapeake shed this company and many of the employees, especially in executive positions, to not only cash in on the overvaluation of the company, but also ridding itself from many levels of incompetence."
bad,"It has been and always shall be my goal to have a safe and productive work environment. I have in two areas of leadership proven to have successfully managed and lead a department in safe and productive manner.  "
bad,"This company used to be great, but I have limited characters. We haven't had raises in two years, the only motivation to work harder is to not get griped at. Nagging and more nagging from the top down. You have to shave and by acquiring your CDL you get screwed. Forced to take days off without pay and they leave you stranded with no vehicle in far away man camps. No per diem, no bonuses and no raises as of the last two years. I have been through a spin off, a bankruptcy and now a sale of the company always hoping it's going to get better soon but it doesn't. Alot of the guys are great but many that stick around have never been anywhere else."
bad,"I loved most of the people I worked with, but the executives were more worried about lining their pockets instead of taking care of the employees that work hard. Think twice before taking a job there."
bad,work at Patterson is normal for a drilling company. Managment in the office is horrible. co-worker are good.
bad,"I began as a contractor shortly after SSE spun off from Chesapeake. It was a temp to hire situation, but was never hired on after more than a year of work. I was promoted twice during my employment, but once managers began dropping like flies, I should have jumped ship. My manager left and was replaced by a completely incompetent person who clearly did not like me, despite the fact that I only ever had 3 conversations with her. Ultimately, I was informed that I had been doing my job incorrectly for over SIX MONTHS even though I was doing it the way I had been trained to. Overall, the problems with this company begin at the top. And while top management is very good, they have brought in absolutely inadequate people to run various departments."
good,"Maintenance rig cost, and Running keeping up with all paper work and all 24 hand working under me at a safe environment. Safe meeting with hand keeping them alert and safe"
good,Working late between 15 to 18 hour days and they expect you to be at your best each day. No regards to family. Company always comes first. Management tends to be on the racial side especially upper management.After long hours at work want you to still drive thie equipment regardless if you are sick or tired.
good,I enjoy the challenges and helping our over 2000 employees in all the day-to-day networking and systems administration problems that occur for a company this size.
good,This job does not work with my family requirements.  They do not have an effective management staff.  They have a decent insurance package.
good,co-worker are alright to be around there safety program is could use some work
good,"No room for advancement and experience meant nothing here when it was time for a promotion. If you wasn't in the click with upper management, then it was and is a very hard place to make it."
good,I worked only part time here but as that I was very welcomed in the company with my coworkers and other. Great place to be apart of. Great staff and company. Very helpful in each task that was being asked to do. very active and moving  place.
good,Job was not secure.  Company was unstable and ended up filing bankruptcy.  Laid off a huge amount of people.  Not good management organization.  If they would have been more frugal with their money and not hired so many employees in the first place they may have been ok.
good,"SSE-"
good,"Enjoyed my job, my coworkers and the people in the field I worked with..  Thought it would be a place to grow but was laid off after 6 years.. will miss my job and coworkers"
good,Due to the down turn in the energy market times are tuff and tuff decisions had to be made. I worked with some of the brightest people in the industry.
good,"I was a contractor for 9 months with this company! Loved going to work and my co-workers. Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was great. Then all of a sudden I was let go, when the position was supposed to be temp to hire. I had no warning whatsoever. Felt like I was lead on for 9 months thinking I was going to be hired on permanently. Don't get me wrong, the company has great benefits/compensation and other perks but feel like management doesn't know what they are doing or what they want in employees. They love to hire temps with no intention of hiring you on permanently from what I've seen, so be weary. If you are looking for a permanent postion look elsewhere. Don't expect it from this company. Overall, I am very disappointed."
good,"I enjoyed the hands I worked with they really looked out for me.  I think the HR for this company(in OKC) is very ineffective. I would say the receptionist in Pearsall was more helpful. The company makes sure you sign every JSA, weekly meeting, but issues concerning benefits are like pulling teeth.  Every time I had an HR issue I had a hard time getting a hold of someone or a response.  They also never sent my w-2 and took until the first of May to send one to me after requesting in March.  Don't get me started on the audit they had this year."
good,A usual day included continues production laced with constant maintenance upkeep. Lessons learned include how to navigate ever present hazards while ensuring work completion. The coworkers tend to be team and goal oriented individuals with wide ranging backgrounds. The toughest part of this job is keeping passé with whoever is setting the expectations as it is a production environment.  Of curse days off are the best part of any job.
good,"Work is challenging and changes every day. However, there is no work life balance as the schedule is either 14/7 or 21/7. Travel on days off. Management tries to take on too much responsibility, which results in certain things not getting done or getting overlooked."
good,"If you can give 90 % of your life to this kind of work then proceed."
good,"Great people, with few exceptions.  "
good,Great company to work for but unfortunately not able to sustain the oil and gas economy.  I had great supervisors and instruction from the administration when I came to delivering superior customer service in the training side.
good,started out like a family but ended like a train wreck.  I wish the company had involved the field workers in some of its decision making before selling to someone else.
good,It was a good job while it lasted. The company benefits were great. The company shut us down with the decline in oil production in the Eagle Ford Shale.
good,"Its fun working in the field but since this company separated from Chesapeake, there have been frequent budget cuts that have lead to good employees quitting. The people that i work with are GREAT! Management is great too except the fact that we've had a new operations manager who is never seen on the field nor did her formally introduce himself to us. There is no sense of care on his part there."
good,Patterson has come along way in the department of safety.  Although many may view some of the policies as extreme but on a daily basis the job and safety policies not only help maintain a positive environment.  It also helps to prevent accidents and work consistently and safely to acheive goals.
good,"Great environment to work, family friendly co workers. Rigs were in good condition. Nomac was safety first up to date safety equipment and training ..."
good,"fun and friendly enviroment, good time off with great pay. Good management and safety is #1"
good,"Good environment, nice & friendly staff and management, a beautiful place to work with the best professional teams, enjoy the one family feeling."
good,"A typical work schedule is 14 days on and 7 days off with first week working days 7am to 7pm, second week working nights 7pm to 7am. Learned how to maintain equipment (machinery) learned how to drill down hole knowing the dangers and how to fix them always had great coworkers and hardest part of job was probably working extended periods outside at heights in the Freezing cold weather. But loved my week of with time to do everything i needed."
good,"The company gave you the freedom to self manage yourself and develop your time management skills. "
good,Leadership encourages professional growth opportunities and fosters a friendly work environment. Leadership is approachable and willing to answer questions from anyone.
good,Awesome place withe awesome people. Second to none when it came to benefits. Wish there were more companies like this around they take good care of their people.
good,Good place to work average benefits and average pay for industry upper management is excellent you’ll get out what you put in this is big industry and if you don’t fit the role then you'll be replaced
good,"Exciting place to work after the spin-off from Chesapeake Energy. Smart and capable employees, team oriented, value add activities. Growth oriented with lots of opportunities to wear many hats."
good,I really enjoy working for Seventy Seven Energy.  It has a great work/life balance.  Wonderful people to work with.  Management is very helpful and cares about their employees.
good,"HARD WORK only a strong person can work here meaning, mentally, physically. long hours of work ,being away from family. That is the only hard part about this job."
good,"Meetings everyday."
good,"Review Client IT emails for potential issues,  internal IT meeting or meeting with client/user."
good,The People at all levels were fantastic to work with and for.  Best job I have ever had. 77 rewarded you for the work you did very little politics.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Seventy Seven energy very much, like all company's somethings needed work. Have no regrets and I was able to learn a lot about myself."
good,"Too bad the oil economy to a turn. Good money, Good people, Safe place.Always looking for newer, safer equipment and processes. Learned teamwork and calling the stop to save people lives."
good,If you don't mind making money or working long hours. Management is good. Lots of room to grow. This company had good training and safety ratings. Hard work in weather elements.
good,"Awesome place to work for. Everyone very friendly and productive "
good,I have grown so much in the 3 years I have worked here.  I have worked with a great Team of people who were willing to share their knowledge.  The work schedule is amazing as well.
good,I love where I work and love the oppeunities that it has givien me.  always new stuff to learn and get to meet alot of people from different areas.
good,"Wore many different hats while employed at Seventy Seven, which I enjoyed very much.  Worked for the Field Manager, 12 truck drivers and two service men.  Also was emailed invoices from Corporate Office, which had to be confirmed with packing slip, coded, signed for approval, and approved for payment. Enjoyed each and every employee I worked with, was kept very busy, which I also enjoy very much."
good,I really enjoyed working here but I just wanted to go overseas. it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend them to someone else
good,It's a good place to work with great management and one will learn a lot about the oil and gas world.  It has great benefits and great management.
good,my typical day was keeping my team safety first the what was need to be done there.  I learn a lot like how to operate the heavy duty forklift my co worker was good we help each other
