rating,review
bad,Company is in bad state and is going to restructuring and lay offs.
bad,"Mainly typing correspondence to vendors and joint venture business partners.  Arranging US and international travel, department expenses, budgeting and organizational charts for satellite offices."
bad,"The Tilden Mine is a horrible place to work. you are treated poorly and unappreciated. nothing you do seems to matter until you break a rule. If your hard hat isn't green they don't care what you have to say. the experience is retiring and they won't hire. they are under threat of a hostile takeover and it's warranted. the US Iron Ore Unit accounts for 63% of what they took in last year and they blew it all on an unprofitable mine in Canada and cut investment in our aging plants. The management from the local level on up in inept. we have people running the mine that couldn't find the bathroom, people that will look at a computer screen and scream bloody murder if everything isn't running without any understanding of the concept of grind control or crushed. The hourly workforce is being treated like children and some likewise act like it and that helps NO ONE. Managers try to create division between the crews, the place is a MESS...... SO MUCH FOR ONECLIFFS........"
bad,"Company has good benefits and depending on where you are or which site there are other pros.  However, in general, the management seems to be more reactive than proactive.  Overall ""putting out fires"" mentality...never ever really gets ahead of the game.  Most of the workforce is older and overall the culture is generally negative, I feel that the millennial generation would have a hard time relating to workers at this company.  Atmosphere of ""team"" seemed to be missing.  Advancement was really never mentioned, if you wanted to advance you had to seek it out yourself and in general the opportunities weren't there.  In regards to this I kind of saw an ""everyone for themself"" attitude.  However, again, the company had good pay and benefits and there were some ""bright"" spots depending on where you were located."
bad,"Not an optimal employer. Moved where they needed a body more often than considered where your skills would be most helpful, if you didn't learn the skills needed to be good at the job you didn't ask for, you were fired."
bad,"When the mining industry is booming, there are large Christmas parties, food from all the vendors allowed in, plenty of compensation, and management is easy going.  When times are bad, all of this goes away and your work life balance never existed in any of this.  Loyalty is by blood only, not by performance."
bad,The employees pay the price for very poor decisions by previous Cliff's board members.  Cut the operation to bare bones.  No employee morale left.  Middle management are just yes men to their superiors.
good,"Poor decision making, It matters who you are related to more than what you do to assure success of your reports.  The very best job I was ever happy not to have.  Talk a great talk, do not begin to walk the walk.  After over 100 years the current management is succeeding in ruining the company."
good,Needs some upper management changes.  Many people changing roles makes it challenging to get things moving.  Long hours and no chance to go out for lunch.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, but there is no opportunity for advancement. I am stuck in the same position and have been there for four years. I have acquired more responsibility, but not the position or pay to go with it. It all depends on the market value and price of met coal whether you have a job one day to the next. I need more stability for me and my family."
good,"very dry... not very friendly unless you are a ""favorite"".   Many Managers are not qualified to manage PEOPLE and lazy.     Costly decisions from the top down."
good,The HR department is one of the worst I have encountered. The company core values are extensive but tend to fall by the wayside when the pressure is on to accomplish a task.
good,"I only worked for a short period of time, but there was a very poor culture that festered at all levels. They could really use some team building exercises"
good,The HR department seams incompetent and managment goes out of there way to waste money while writing off there poor job performance on workers. Coworkers are helpful and easy to get along with.
good,"Expect a rocky road due to the declining iron ore prices. New management is working toward change, but it may be too little too late. What makes Cliffs is the people you work with, true professionals."
good,"Déception dû à la fermeture de la mine."
good,ran heavy equipment and id work for them again if there were changes in some of the personal.
good,"Did general clean up of all mining areas, used forklift, and some minor construction projects.  Management seemed okay.  Didn't know a lot of my co-workers.  Working conditions were not good, very dirty and safety was always a concern. I enjoyed learning about mining."
good,It can be very trying working in union environment at times. Cliffs pays pretty well for your troubles.
good,"très bonne cie, a une bonne culture d entreprise lors de la formation dans les bureau mais n etait pas appliquer rendu sur le terrain de la mine. Plusieurs points de sécurités étaient défficient"
good,"Overall this was a great place to work.  The Company has a wonderful culture, with exceptional people."
good,Le fait de bâtir un site minier de A à Z m'a appris beaucoup ce fut extrêmement enrichissant.
good,enjoyed working there. benefits were great. it was hard work but I that is what I liked about it.  its a shame what has happened to the coal industry.
good,"Work Procedure"
good,"A small mining company with little room for advancement. Extensive travel and high stress levels are the norm, often with little support or direction given by upper management."
good,"I worked 11 pm to 8 am. My shift started out ether cold and wet or hot and humid and always very loud. 99% of the time i worked alone. When i got to my work site I had to inspect the belts, structure, drive motors and all other equipment used to do my job. Occasionally I had to call my shift foreman, maintenance or an electrician to fix an issue i could not resolve myself. Had constant communication using a two way radio. The best part of my job was my coworkers."
good,company is in a great location and has great benefits and salary. i loved working there but they have an uncertain future and layoffs have been massive
good,"a typical day at was was fun but it was work. everyday felt the same you might be doing a different job but it felt the same. i learned a lot in my 3 years there i can run ever piece of face equipment except the miner. management was not great it just seem like they couldnt get anything done . they send us to fix something and tell us how to fix it . the we would have to go back the next day and do it again but fix it our way then it was fixed right.ther wasnt really anything too hard you just about had a piece of equipment to do anything."
good,Great career- superb benefits. i worked with bright people who wanted to do the best job they could for the business and the employees. i had a lot of fun and was treated well.
good,general laborer so I got to do a bunch of different stuff. Drive 240 - 320 ton dump trucks do general cleanup when needed. watch for fires on conveyor belts.
good,During this time as an intern it gave me insight to the mining industry.  They treated me well and allowed me to work during college
good,"La formación de un equipo y realización de las tareas en forma correcta, a tiempo y según el plan."
good,"A struggling iron ore mining company with a great heart.  The people are what make this company a great place to work.  Teamwork is truly practiced on a daily basis.  There are many challenges currently facing the mining industry with falling iron ore and coal prices so the company is forced to do more with fewer people.  This is a great opportunity for those individuals who enjoy getting in the details, learning new things and switching roles as the need arises."
good,"As a self-motivated employee I started my day by listening to all voice mails and reading all emails, prioritizing each issue.  I would then start with the most critical task and work my way down.  Inevitably I would be interrupted by management with a task that would take precedence.  It may be a power point presentation, a word document or an excel spreadsheet.  It could be any task.  If new cases came in I would get that organized with a new file, due dates, and a summary.  I would make travel arrangements, process expense reports, process invoices with a system called OnBase.   Using a follow up system that I created I would refer to that for due dates.  Before I would leave in the evening I would check with my managers for any last minute needs before I left for the day.  If they did, I would stay until the task was complete."
good,"Excellent organization, good atmosphere and co-workers."
good,Responsible for all finance aspects of the coal business unit
good,"Malgré que l'environnement des mines peut être assez difficile à l'occasion, j'ai bien aimé évoluer dans cette entreprise."
good,"Cliffs is a wonderful company that strives to care for its employees. The branch companies, such as Oak Grove Resources, are usually 24-7 operations where an ideal work/life balance cannot be expected unless you are a day shift employee. Because of small operations and limited position openings, the room for advancement has become scarce. "
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, everyone i worked with was very knowledgeable and very safety oriented."
good,Heavy dirty work you know at the end of the day you've been at work very dangerous work environment iron ore mining but lots of good people to work with
good,"Historically, this has been a great place to work. Ideal location, and good experience in the sourcing field.  I enjoyed working with various suppliers on sourcing projects, and negotiating savings to present to Stakeholders.  I have no comment for the current environment, however."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance was perfect."
good,"PM's on various electrical apparatus including transformers, starters and substations. Work with many different voltages up to 13.8 kv. Management seems to do a fairly decent job of organizing work and making sure that things are done in a timely fashion. Co-worker are competent and easy to get along with. It's a fairly big place and there are times when you are needed in three different places at once. Difficult to do. Best part of the job are the various challenges you face on a daily basis."
good,"Place is hot and dirty all year long, a lot of the management staff is young or lack experience. The union and the company have a pretty good relationship. We currently have workers on layoff due to the shut down of the Empire mine."
good,Loved working with the management and team. Enjoyed the fast paced environment and dealing with vendors to get needed parts. Enjoyed the scheduling and follow up to see if work was completed. My immediate supervisor and the Maintenance Manager were great people to work with. They were fair and honest and always helped me to be the best I could be.
good,I really liked Cliffs. It paid well and I still miss it today. I had married a boss there and we decided it stay home. Upon wanting to return the option was no longer available. The company and cooperate sided with my then ex husband although he stole from their company and fratenized there.
good,Start shift with what I was to do and where to go and with who. I learned more working at the mines than I have ever learned at all the jobs combined Most of co workers with experience were very knowledgeable  and great to work with. Hardest part of my job while  I was there was carrying a cutter shaft to the shear 1000 feet down the face of the long wall when the top was very low the shaft was heavy.
good,"Au départ de la journée on ne savait pas quelle surprise nous allions avoir, aucune journée étaient pareil. Nous avions souvent un défi soit de l'environnement qui nous entoure ou des problèmes que nous aurions a affronter toute la journée. Mais nous avions des bonnes formations et on partageaient nos connaissances. Nos patrons étaient soucieux des notre sécurité ils avaient pas trop de manque c'était parfois les gens (travailleurs) qui avaient mauvaise foie. Mais tout problème se corrige et nous trouvions souvent la solution. j'ai eu une belle gang des bons amis dans mes 10 ans de service, mais je dirais que le plus difficile dans mon poste de mécanicien, était de faire face a un ralentissement de travail venant des plus vieux (étant donner l'âge de l'usine), je suis travaillant et j'ai pas peur d'essuyer mon front une fois a l'autre mais le travail doit ce faire pas de production pas de salaire. Le plus agréable que j'ai vécu dans mon poste est comment les superviseurs étaient exemplaires et de plus même si je suis plus chez cliffs mines Wabush je doit dire que j'ai encore contact avec eux via Facebook, et ils voudraient bien que je reviens travailler pour eux."
good,I was able to learn many skills in the mining but he company is tied to the mining cycle and will not likely rebound unless the mining cycle swings in their favor.
good,The IT group was full of star performers. Poor management decisions lead the company in the wrong direction which has almost brought the company down. Sad to see such a great place lose so many great people.
good,"Good people at the staff level. Some major mistakes by upper management have resulted in the company experiencing extremely poor financial performance for the past two years."
good,"A Typical work week was planned two weeks in advance of which mine you would be helping or working with. There was away a followup meeting on what was done and was left and was scheduled in the next week. "
good,Working for cliffs was a pleasure. I enjoyed every day. Work environment was always safe and the entire staff practiced safety.
good,"Good Position, gained valuable experience. Operated heavy equipment. Safety a priority."
good,"ability to speak free and offer suggestions, given small but rewarding project type work to plan from at initial stage and follow through till completed. "
good,"Cliffs is a great company to work for.  A typical day requires collaboration and a strong ability to prioritize workload.  They gave me an opportunity to really expand my career. The hardest part of my job is working in an environment that is currently undergoing some financial difficulties due to poor market performance and the potential voluntary and involuntary loss of coworkers. However, the challenges the company presents to someone at my level, as well as the industry alone, has made it a very rewarding company to work for."
good,"Was planning on staying there, but the president made a few poor financial decisions and there had to be a company-wide layoff.  Management was better than usual and was promoted a few times in my 5 years there."
good,"Great place to work, easy to advance. Management is great. The industry is in a bit of a downturn currently so there has been a lot of reductions which is unfortunate. However it is a proud company that has been through these cycles before."
good,"As a Concentrator Repair Person, I am responsible for the repair of most everything in every department of the mines. The management is ok and people are great. The safety is the most issue of the job but as long as you follow the safety rules and wear the proper gear, you should be ok. I enjoyed every day work."
good,This Quality job was 24/7 and I took a lot of pride in what I was doing and the Company and did also. We loaded 15 to 22 unit trains a month.
good,"Cliffs benefits are excellent for their employees and reasonably priced considering all the changes with our health care environment.  Cliffs also has two personal holidays.  Overall, they have a great benefit package."
good,"L`horaire de type Fly in Fly out est un must"
good,"As a fire boss pumper I travel throughout the mines searching, evaluating, and correcting hazardous conditions.  Making safe work areas for employees throughout the mine. However, due to poor coal marketing I am forced to start searching for another job."
good,Get up in the morning go to work get ready go underground and bolt top ive learned how to read the top and know what it is going to do. The management is pretty good th.ey treat their employees pretty good. Your co workers are real good people they make you feel right at home
good,"Cliffs is a very good company, well managed with professional people.  The only drawback (and it is more the industry, than the company) is the volatility of the market.  High salaries, great benefits, and lots of layoffs."
good,This company is a great to work for.  They supported my career and encouraged me to pursue many areas to better myself and my work.
good,"Working at Cliffs was a challenging and rewarding job.  Meeting and exceeding daily production targets was rewarding.  When I fell short it was frustrating but as long as the day was safe all was well.  Hardest part of the job was trying to change certain things, with a big company like Cliffs, change is slow.  Do miss the people I worked with but not the schedule."
good,Everybody was very friendly and eager to help. Unfortunately rumors of more lay offs finally came true for me after surviving 3 others.
good,"I enjoy what I do when I am at work, but the sched. is hard on the life outside work."
good,I just like working underground it is a brother hood that can not explain when I was in Afghanistan we had to stick to gather or we would not made it there I work sins I was 15 years old hung metal building up worked at Wal-Mart when I was a signor in high school I bin a coalminer last 10 years and last 7 years I bean a boss in mines I started out moving belt then went to section boss and a shift foreman I have learn over years if you treat people how you wont treated your work place is better and people will work harder for you the best saying is lead by example and I have always do that

Got along great with everyone I worked with I enjoyed going to work every day.Loved the fact that I got to work outside a lot and got to work in a shop environment. Worked on locomotives, various types of auxiliary equipment, production haul trucks, super shovels and Leturneau"
good,"Fantastic location, the roster was the best 5:2, 4:3, 9:5. The Management team was great to work with. The equipment was well maintained and the workshop facilities were of good standard."

good,The people I worked with everyday made this job safe and fun.
good,"Management and work colleagues plus office staff all made my time at Koolyanobbing an enjoyable experience."
good,I enjoyed building relationships with my fellow legal team members and with my client groups.  I have learned a lot from the experience and understand what legal advice is important to an in-house client when they are trying to make a business decision.  I feel that my judgment and background would be an asset for any company and that I could be a contributing and productive in-house resource right from the start.
good,Working with heavy equipment. Operating over head cranes and getting certified on other equipment. Safety is really stress on the job site and teamwork
good,"Cliffs Natural Resources, was a good place to work. They provided safety awards every quarter, and they also had cookout at the work site for the men if the coal production was above normal, catered Christmas dinner for all men."
good,"Cliffs pays more than anybody else in my area and management was great with two lunch breaks a day and payed vacations ! The insurance was also good , payed vacations , and they also offerd a good pension !  I retired with a 30 year pension!"
good,It's a really good company ... Cared a lot about the men that work for them ... A lot room to have grown with the company ... Always cared about our safety n gave us bonuses for good safe practice ....
